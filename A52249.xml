            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>viz.</hi> That in this Tract I follow One of ſo great Accompliſhments: who being next the Light, and of a far more perfect Stature then my ſelf, muſt needs caſt back a ſhadow on me: Unleſs I be ſo far behind him, that his ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow will not reach me. But if it do, I ſhall (as <hi>Ionah</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe) reſt very quietly in that ſhadow.</p>
            <p>The Subject handled is a choice and precious One, as any in the Book of God without Exception. This Prayer being as it were a little piece, that dropt off from the heart of Jeſus Chriſt (as once <hi>Eliahs</hi> Mantle from his body) as he was taking leave of his Apoſtles and the World together. When He was even going forth to ſuffer, He (Swan-like) ſung this dying Song, and poured out this precious Prayer, being about to pour forth his very blood and life with it. And this he did not for his Apoſtles only then about him, but for us alſo: even for us, who ſhould in after-times believe through their words. A man would think our bleſſed Saviour, when He had ſuch a Task to undergo, and ſuch a buſineſs to diſpatch, ſhould have been wholly taken up with the preapprehenſion of his inſtant Death and Paſsion: That this ſhould have <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi> or <hi>diverted</hi> Him from other thoughts; eſpecially from taking care of ſuch poor Worms as we are. But that when he was drawing neer to ſuch a Conflict with the <hi>Wrath of God,</hi> and the <hi>Indignities and Wrongs of men,</hi> He ſhould have us in his heart: That our dear Friend, who loved us and gave
<pb facs="tcp:46169:3"/>
Himſelf for us, ſhould <hi>think of us,</hi> and <hi>pray for us,</hi> and ſpeak of us to God the Father with ſo high affection when his own Soul was heavy to the very Death: Such a Prayer made by ſuch a Mediatour, at ſuch a time as that was, muſt needs be worthy of the choiceſt and exacteſt Obſervation of the Church in every Age to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Some Antiquaries tell us of the <hi>Diptyches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lindan. Annot. in Liturg. S. Petri. pag. <hi>39.</hi>
               </note> much in uſe in the Primitive Church: Which were two leaves or tables bound together, on the one of which was a Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of divers famous and renowned Worthies <hi>departed</hi> in the Faith of Chriſt; and on the other a Commemoration of the like Perſonages <hi>yet alive.</hi> Much Honoured Sir,<note place="margin">Joſeph. Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Obfervat. Eccleſiae. Dae Miſſae Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratu. Tom. <hi>4.</hi> lib. <hi>7.</hi> cap. <hi>17.</hi>
               </note> I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you here with a new ſort of Diptyches, the Tables more exactly anſwering one another. The one containing a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of a <hi>dying Chriſt,</hi> and ſhewing how He pray'd on Earth: In which you may alſo ſee what is contained in the other Table; and how he prays for us in Heaven, who <hi>ever liveth</hi> to make Interceſſion for us. So that if you deſire at any time to know, how Chriſt perſues the buſineſs, and pleads the cauſes of his poor Church at the right hand of his Father, you ſhall do well to have recourſe to this Chapter, which may be very fitly called a <hi>Counterpart</hi> of our Saviours Interceſsion.</p>
            <p>And truly, for my own part, I muſt freely and ingenuouſly profeſs, that I had never known ſo much of Chriſt and of his tender Care and Love of poor ſinners, had I not ſtudyed theſe Emanations and Effluxes of his precious Soul, had I not ſeen his Breaſt open in this Chapter, and the Names of the twelve Tribes tranſcribed out of the Breaſt-plate of the <hi>Typical</hi> into the heart of the <hi>Typified</hi> High Prieſt.<note place="margin">Fox Act. &amp; Mon. ad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>1558.</hi>
               </note> And as the Queen of <hi>England</hi> ſometimes ſaid, That if they opened her when ſhe was dead, they ſhould find <hi>Calais</hi> written on her heart: So when I had the happineſs to open Chriſt in this Prayer, (though with a moſt unskilful hand) I found the Church engraven deeply on his Heart, and ſaw ſuch things as cannot be uttered. The Lord give you and me to know more of that Love which <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> and to return more Love to Him, who pray'd for us, and dyed for us. We may eaſily
<pb facs="tcp:46169:4"/>
exceed in loving other <hi>things</hi> and <hi>perſons.</hi> We may love more then we <hi>are loved,</hi> we may love more then we <hi>ſhould love.</hi> But here our hearts may take their full ſwing, there is no fear of over-loving Jeſus Chriſt. For as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſweetly ſpeaks of our Love to God,<note place="margin">Bern. De dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo Deo.</note> 
               <hi>Modus Deum diligendi eſt ſine modo diligere:</hi> The ſame may I as truly ſay of our Love to Chriſt; The <hi>meaſure</hi> of loving Chriſt, is to love him <hi>out of meaſure:</hi> So hath he loved us,<note place="margin">☞.</note> and ſo ſhould we love him.</p>
            <p>There are eſpecially two great Boons which Jeſus Chriſt begs of his Father for Believers in this Prayer: That they may <hi>be one here,</hi> and that they may <hi>be in one place hereafter.</hi> This Nation ſeems not to be under the dint of the Influence of this Prayer at this time, in which the Lord hath ſuffered ſuch a ſpirit of Diviſion (a ſpirit that our Saviour never prayed for) to poſſeſs his own people: So that his Body lies a bleeding, the members being miſerably rent into pieces. He bled indeed ſufficiently upon the Croſs in his <hi>Natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> but there was ſuddenly a <hi>Conſummatum eſt</hi> to that. When will there be a <hi>Conſummatum eſt</hi> to this, in his <hi>Myſtical Body?</hi> When will Chriſt ſay, It is enough? When will the ſtream of blood that <hi>ran there,</hi> ſtop this which <hi>runs here?</hi> When will there be an end of theſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, theſe after-afflictions of Chriſt, which now he is ſat down at reſt on the right hand of the Father, perſue him thither, and will not ſuffer him to be quiet in his glory?</p>
            <p>It's true, the Body of our Saviour in theſe Nations, bleeds not now by cruel Perſecutors hands, as it hath done in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, bleſſed be the Lord for ever.

            <p>Now the God of Peace himſelf give us Peace alwayes, and by all means. And Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Peace, who doth ſo often and ſo importunately beg it of his Father for his people, as you may ſee in this Chapter, give us to reap, in our dayes, the bleſſed fruits of this Prayer: That they that <hi>are but one Body</hi> (according to the firſt branch of our Saviours Prayer) may have but one Heart and one Soul in that Body, that there may be no Schiſm in the Body. And they that <hi>are to be in one place</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecond Branch) may keep in one way to that place, that they may not fall out by the way, ſo far at leaſt as to divide, to part <hi>Companies,</hi> and part <hi>ways;</hi> that they may neither fail of coming in the end to one place; nor loſe the benefit and comfort of one anothers Company and ſweet Communion in the way thither.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Words of ſuch a friend who is likely to continue, take not ſo deep impreſſion as his who is dying or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting. The laſt farewell of ſuch a one as is dear in our affections is moſt obſerved, and beſt remembred. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret winning and commanding power accompanies ſuch parting paſſages; and hence our Saviour Chriſt was frequent in them, when he was ready to be offered up, and to be finally withdrawn from his diſciples. They who left all for him; muſt needs be very much dejected to be left by him; And therefore he was wiſe and merciful to give them Comfort while he was among them, and to diſpatch them down a Comforter from heaven when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them. Upon the firſt of theſe he ſpends no leſs then four chapters, all tending to confirm and fortifie their hearts againſt the bitter trials and afflictions which they were to meet withall when he was gone. And this he doth by ſpeaking to them, and by ſpeaking for them. Both wayes he ſeeks to ſtrengthen them; by ſpeaking to them in a way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; by ſpeaking for them in a way of ſupplication. The firſt of theſe he ends with the foregoing chapter, the latter he purſues in this; which I intend (with Gods aſſiſtance) to go through withall; as I ſhall have ability and opportunity. And therefore in the entrance of this chapter it is ſaid with reference to thoſe which go before, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus,</hi> Theſe words he ſpake to his diſciples in a way of conſolation. And then
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46169:18"/>
immediately is added what he ſpake for his Diſciples in a way of ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus, and lifed up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father the hour is come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that this Chapter which I am to handle is the Lords prayer. From the beginning of it to the end, nothing but the Lords prayer. Not the Lords prayer which he taught us, but the Lords prayer which he made for us. Not that which he propounded to us, as our pattern; but that which he preſented for us, as our priviledge.</p>
               <p>Whether this were the very prayer which he uttered in the garden, when he was in an Agony, is much diſputed. Some think it was the very ſame for ſubſtance; and that it is ſet down more largely here, by <hi>John</hi> then by the reſt of the Evangeliſts, becauſe none of them were preſent, when Chriſt made that prayer, but he took <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> with him, as you may ſee, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33. But this is but a meer fancy. For in the firſt verſe of the following chapter, it is manifeſt that Chriſt went not to the garden till he had ended this prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.1. <hi>When he had ſpoken theſe words,</hi> that is, the very prayer we are entering on, <hi>He went forth with his Diſciples over the brook</hi> Cedron; <hi>where was a garden, into which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> Nor is it probable that our Evangeliſt, if he had given us the ſum of that prayer, would wholly have omitted that which was the main petition in it, and which is ſo exactly mentioned by all the reſt of the Evangeliſts, <hi>Father if it be poſsible let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> Of which we have not the leaſt hint in this Chapter: Beſides it is to be obſerved, that our Saviour made that prayer in the garden lying proſtrate upon the earth, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>He fell upon his face and prayed:</hi> Whereas the prayer we are now about to handle, was made, with face and eyes erect, and lifted up to Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe words ſpake Ieſus, and lift up his eyes to Heaven, and ſaid, Father the hour is come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that this prayer of our Saviour was evidently, and unqueſtionably made, before his coming to the garden of <hi>Gethſemane,</hi> juſt as he was about to go thither. He had been ſwan-like ſinging out his dying ſong in the ears of his Diſciples, for the ſpace of three Chapters, and ſpeaking many things to comfort them, being at the point to leave them. And having finiſht what he had to ſay, he ſhuts up all with this prayer, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Ieſus, and lifted up his eyes to Heaven, and ſaid;</hi> which having ended, immediately away he goes, and is betrayed; As you may ſee in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the following chapter.</p>
               <p>You ſee then what a Subject we have now to handle; A prayer, and a prayer made by Chriſt, the great High-prieſt, the Advocate and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of his people, and the laſt publike, Solemn prayer that he made with his Apoſtles, and Diſciples, juſt as he was about to ſuffer. He took his laſt farewell of them in this prayer, and therefore you muſt think it was a Spiritfull, a zealous, and a pithy one. When he was going to be crucified, he took his leave in a long oration to them, which having done, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, and ſo left them. And truly ſuch a prayer made by ſuch a one as Jeſus Chriſt, at ſuch a time, and on ſuch an occaſion, and among ſuch a company, muſt needs be heavenly and raviſhing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46169:18"/>
will deſerve our beſt intention, both in handling, and in hearing. Chriſt was in heaven in his thoughts and his affections, when he made it, <hi>Theſe things ſpake Ieſus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and ſaid;</hi> The Lord in mercy grant that we may be in heaven, while we hear it.</p>
               <p>To make way to the handling of it, I ſhall conſider three things; Firſt, the tranſition to it. Then Secondly the geſture, and the carriage of our Saviour in it. Thirdly the ſubſtance, and the matter of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt the tranſition to it, from the former chapter, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus,</hi> theſe words expreſſed in the long diſcourſe before.</p>
               <p>Then Secondly the geſture, and the carriage of our Saviour in it, he <hi>lifted up his eyes to heaven</hi> while he made it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly the ſubſtance; and the matter of it, and it is wholly for the Church, either for himſelf the head of the Church, in reference, and with relation to the Church, or for the members of the Church Firſt, for himſelf the head of the Church, he deſireth glorification, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son,</hi> in the firſt verſe of the chapter, and this in reference and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Church, as is apparent at <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>That they may behold his glory.</hi> Then Secondly, for the members of the Church, he deſireth confirmation, and that either for the Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him, the members of the preſent Church; Or elſe for thoſe who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of the Church to come.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place he prayes for the Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him, the members of the preſent Church, who were already called and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at the ſixth, and following verſes, whom God had given him out of the world, <hi>I pray for them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray not for the world.</hi> In the Second place he prayes for thoſe who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of the Church that was to come, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. and ſo on to the concluſion of the Chapter, <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe in me through their word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this prayer of our Saviour Chriſt you ſee, is very full. It is for himſelf the head of the Church, And it is for the Church which is his body, of which alone he is the Saviour and the Interceſſor. It is for the preſent Church, it is for the Church to come. It is for the Apoſtles and the Miniſters, the officers and teachers of the Church. And it is for the ordinary members of the Church, who believe through their words. So that whoever appertaineth to the Church, let him live in what time he will, be he of what condition or eſtate he will, he hath a ſhare in this prayer.</p>
               <p>We muſt begin with the tranſition to it, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus.</hi> Theſe words, what words? the words in the three Chapters next before, all tending to eſtabliſh his Apoſtles and Diſciples, which the Evangeliſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates exactly for the comfort and confirmation of the Church of Chriſt, even to the worlds end: and having done with the relation, he ſhuts it up with this, <hi>Theſe word ſpake Jeſus,</hi> and ſo goes onward to his ſupplication. The point apparently ſuggeſted to us here, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The words that Jeſus ſpake are very fit to be commended to the choiceſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his Church and people.</head>
                  <p>And here they are ſo carefully, and ſo exactly gathered up by the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, and knit together in a chain, every Link of which is precious. And having laid them all together, he writes this under them, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus. q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d.</hi> Take heed that you obſerve, and mark them well, they are the words, not of an ordinary man, but of the bleſſed Son of God, the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the Church. Theſe words were breathed from the lips of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and therefore ſee that you take notice of them, and value them accordingly. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus;</hi> indeed the ſumm and ſubſtance of the four Evangeliſts is but the hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt, of his words, and of his actions, and therefore <hi>Luke</hi> reduceth all that he hath written in his Goſpel to theſe two heads, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.1. <hi>The former Treatiſe have I made O</hi> Theophilus <hi>of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach.</hi> His treatiſe (as you ſee) conſiſted of theſe two things, either that which Jeſus did, or elſe that which Jeſus ſpake; So that his ſayings (as you ſee) are very memorable and remarkable, being by ſpecial revelation and direction of the Spirit put in writing, and ſo left upon record for the inſtruction and the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people to the worlds end. You may obſerve what care is taken to gather up the words of Jeſus, as they dropt from him upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, that none of them might periſh and be loſt; by which it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent they were things of worth and uſe, and fit to be preſerved for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And it is noted to the praiſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe <hi>kept his Sayings</hi> when others loſt them, yea <hi>ſhe kept all his ſayings,</hi> and <hi>ſhe kept them in her heart,</hi> that was the Cabinet in which ſhe put them, when others valued them as things of nothing, and looked upon them but as looſe words; And therefore ſhe is ſet in oppoſition to them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.5. <hi>They underſtood not the ſayings which he ſpake to them, but</hi> Mary <hi>kept all theſe ſayings in her heart.</hi> She laid them near her heart as choice things. It was the promiſe of our Saviour Chriſt to his diſciples, and one of the laſt he made them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly it was a precious one, that if they ſhould forget the words that he had ſpoken to them, he would diſpatch them down his ſpirit out of heaven, and this ſhould be one great part of his buſineſs with them, to mind them of ſuch words of his as were ſlipt out of their minds, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come, and he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which it is apparent that the words which Jeſus ſpake are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this will yet appear more fully and diſtinctly to you, if you conſider but theſe three things: Firſt whoſe the words were. Then what the words were. Thirdly, the manner how the words were ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe, if you conſider whoſe the words were, you will diſcern them to be very fit to be commended to the choiceſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46169:19"/>
of the Church. The author of them, if you look no further, will purchaſe them ſo much credit. They are <hi>the words that Jeſus ſpake,</hi> as you have in my text; And ſhall that which Jeſus ſpake, any thing which he delivered, be thought unworthy of the notice of his people? Why what was Jeſus, that the words that dropt from him muſt be ſo highly valued, and eſteemed? My brethren, if you look upon him upwards, with relation to the father; or if you look upon him downwards, with relation to the Church, you will ſee enough for this, on all hands.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If you look upon him upwards, with relation to the father, you will ſee reaſon why his words ſhould be Commended to the choiceſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Church and people. He is the fathers own ſon. But you will ſay, wiſe fathers have very often weak children. But Jeſus Chriſt is ſo his fathers ſon, that he partaketh with him of his wiſdom, it is poured out into him in abundance. And therefore he is ſometimes called <hi>the wiſdom of the father</hi> in the abſtract, as ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>Ieſus Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God.</hi> And if he be ſo very wiſe you may be ſure he ſpake wiſe words, and wiſe words are worth the marking. In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. And out of queſtion what he bringeth forth is of the treaſure that is hid in him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But in the next place, if you look upon him downwards, with Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church, you will ſee further reaſon why the words that Jeſus ſpake, ſhould be ſo exactly noted, and ſo carefully obſerved. As he is the fathers wiſdom, ſo he is <hi>made to us wiſdom,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. His father hath appointed him to be the great Prophet of of his Church. The great preacher, the greater revealer of his truth and will to men, and therefore out of queſtion he can ſpeak well, and his words are worth the marking. You may be ſure the father would not ſend out ſuch a Prophet to the Church as were not worth the liſtening to. No, no, God hath <hi>annointed me to preach,</hi> faith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. not appointed me to preach, but annointed me to preach, endued me with abilities and gifts for that office, <hi>God who in former times</hi> (ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>ſpake to the fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe latter dayes ſpoken to us by the Son.</hi> He was deſigned, you ſee, to be the ſpokſman for the father to the world, to tell them what his mind is, and to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to them.</p>
                  <p>We that are ordinary preachers of the Goſpel, we that are underlings to Chriſt in this buſineſs, muſt be enabled with ſome competent ability in this reſpect, or elſe we are not fit for this work. And therefore when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſent out his diſciples, he promiſed to give them wiſdom, and a mouth; that is, matter and expreſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.15. wiſdom within, together with a mouth to utter and to bring forth that wiſdom. To ſhew that both of theſe muſt go together in a preacher of the Goſpel. I know there is a latitude to be admitted and allowed in this regard, but yet a competent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſpeak ſo as the people may be edified by it, is indiſputably required. And if the under-miniſters of Chriſt muſt have ſuch a faculty, how great ability then muſt their Maſter have? Who was deſigned to be the great Preacher, the great Prophet, and (as the Apoſtle ſtiles him) the chief
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46169:20"/>
Biſhop of our Souls. And if he had ſuch a tranſcendent faculty to ſpeak, then certainly the words he ſpake are fit to be commended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Then ſecondly, if you conſider as whoſe the words were, ſo in the next place what the words were; you will allow them to be worthy of our choiceſt obſervation. What the words were that Jeſus ſpake, either for the matter of them, or for the efficacy of them, let us a little weigh them in their order, and we ſhall ſee they both help to this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The words of Jeſus, for the matter of them, commonly were Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel words. Such were the words to which my text alludes, in the three chapters next before, full of nothing elſe (my brethren) but Goſpel-ſweetneſs, Goſpel-Promiſes, and Goſpel-conſolation againſt approaching troubles and afflictions, theſe were the words that <hi>Jeſus ſpake.</hi> Chriſt in a ſenſe (my brethren) was the firſt, and certainly the chiefeſt preacher of the Goſpel; this great Salvation, at the firſt, began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed afterwards by them that heard him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. And hence the Goſpel, (as you know) is called Chriſts ſaying, <hi>John</hi> 8.51. The Law was the fathers ſaying. <hi>God ſpake theſe words.</hi> The Goſpel is the Sons ſaying, <hi>This was ſpoken by the Son.</hi> And hence ſaith Chriſt in the fore-alledged text, <hi>if a man keep my ſaying he ſhall never ſee Death.</hi> So that the ſayings and the words of Jeſus are very fit to be conſidered: For his; you ſee, are Goſpel-ſayings, and Goſpel ſayings are worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as the Apoſtle tels you, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Indeed Law-Sayings are not ſo readily attended to, and entertained. You know (my brethren) on mount Sinai, at the giving of the Law, there were thunderings, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and terrible voices, and the event, and iſſue was, <hi>the people fled, and would not hear, they were not able to endure the noiſe.</hi> But Goſpel-ſayings on the other ſide allure affection, and invite attention. Upon mount <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> where our Saviour was transfigured <hi>there was a ſhining Sun, a bright cloud, a gentle and a pleaſing voice,</hi> and the Diſciples ſaid, <hi>Edificemus Domine, Let us build here, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the words of Jeſus for the matter of them were Goſpel-words, ſo for the efficacy of them, they were ſaying words; and ſo in that reſpect, the words that Jeſus ſpake are very fit to be commended <hi>&amp;c. The words that I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Jews, <hi>are ſpirit and life,</hi> John 6.63. they are ſo in their operation and effect, they give Spirit, and they work life: And who would not attend unto, and entertain ſuch words as theſe are? His ſaying, if it be received and kept, will ſurely ſave a man from death, yea, from eternal death. We may depend upon it, he binds it with a ſtrong aſſeveration, which he repeats twice for the more Surety, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.51. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily verily I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death</hi> Death is not viſible, the meaning is, he ſhall not be annoyed and hurted by it; as you have the like Expreſſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. <hi>We ſhall not ſee ſword nor fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi> And ſhould not ſuch words be commended to the Church, and embraced by the Church, as ſave from death, and bring eternal life with them? The ſetting down of which upon Record in holy Scripture, and leaving them to after-times, hath been the life of many ſouls, and will be yet of many more in every age, even to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>If you conſider in the laſt place, as whoſe the words were, and what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46169:20"/>
the words were that Jeſus ſpake, ſo the manner how he ſpake them; you will ſee further reaſon yet, why they ſhould be commended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this you may depend upon, <hi>Never man ſpake like him.</hi> It is the atteſtation that is given him, <hi>John</hi> 7.46. Which coming from his enemies, the officers that went to take him, is of the more validity, <hi>Never ſpake man like this man.</hi> Grace was poured into his lips, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45.2. to ſhew us that the grace there mentioned, is a gift of utterance, and a faculty of ſpeech whereof the lips are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. They are the lips that form the words we ſpeak, and bring them forth to thoſe that hear them; and hence this gift of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which the Pſalmiſt calls a Grace, is ſaid there to be poured into the Lips of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>There was a ſtream of holy eloquence continually flowing there, which ſometimes even drowned them that heard him. <hi>He ſpake with power and authority;</hi> his words had the command of mens affections, ſo that he carried them where he pleaſed. Indeed he carried them beyond themſelves in wonder, and aſtoniſhment, to hear him ſpeak ſometimes as he did, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.22. <hi>They were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine,</hi> not only at the matter of it, though that were admirable too, but at the manner of delivery, <hi>For he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the Scribes.</hi> And <hi>Luke</hi> informs us that all men bare him witneſs, and gave teſtimony to him, he was ſo famous and renowned for this gift of his; and wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.22: You heard but now that grace was poured into his lips, and here you ſee, that grace was poured out of his lips. God poured it in, and he as freely poured it out, ſo as the people wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. Such were the words that Jeſus ſpake, and ſuch words you will ſay, are very fit for choiceſt obſervation, and attention. The gift of eloquence (my brethren) calls for audience, eſpecially ſuch heavenly and Holy eloquence as Chriſts is. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo (my Brethren) that the words that Jeſus ſpake are very fit to be commended, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </label> Then let them be received with choiceſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation by his Church, and People. Let them not undervalue any of the words that Jeſus ſpake, but let them entertain them with a very high eſteem. There have been ſome of late who have ſlighted thoſe words, who have been bold to call them inckie divinity, a dead letter, and the like; And yet our Saviour Chriſt himſelf tells us, <hi>The words that I ſpeak are Spirit and Life,</hi> Iohn 6.63. Oh (my beloved) I beſeech you let every one of us be far from giving way to any mean account, or ſlight thoughts of any words that Chriſt ſpake; Let us keep up our obſervation, our eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, our admiration of them to the very higheſt. It's true (my Brethren) we ſhould carefully attend, and duly mark all Scripture words, For all the Scripture <hi>is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. And all the Scripture is profitable for our ſelves, <hi>for Doctrine, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for Inſtruction, to make the man of God perfect,</hi> as it is added there in that place. But the words that Jeſus ſpake are the choiceſt part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore muſt have choiceſt obſervation. <hi>Never man,</hi> and

what if I ſhould ſay, never inſpired man ſpake like to him, they came not fully home to his meaſure: They had the ſpirit indeed, and ſo had he, but he <hi>received not the Spirit by meaſure</hi> as they did. <hi>He was annointed with that oyl above his fellows;</hi> though not without them, yet above them, as the chief Prophet, and they the under-Prophets of the Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we read, or hear, or meet with any words that Chriſt ſpake, let us take ſpecial notice of them, let us fix and dwell upon them, and let them reſt and dwell in us. <hi>Let the words of Chriſt dwell in us Richly,</hi> let us have an eye to mark them, an ear to hear them, and a heart to keep them, as <hi>Mary</hi> had, of whom it is obſerved that ſhe kept all his ſayings in her heart. How carefully did the Apoſtle keep that which our Saviour ſpake, though it be no where mentioned in the Goſpel, and wiſhes other men to do ſo too, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.35. <hi>Remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give then to receive,</hi> and ſo he mindeth the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in a ſpecial manner of that which Chriſt himſelf ſpake with his own voice, not by the Miniſtry of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>To the married I command, and yet not I, but the Lord,</hi> not I as an Inſpired Apoſtle, but the Lord with his own mouth when he was converſant upon the earth: as if the words that dropped immediately from his lips did challenge ſingular regard. And ſuch regard, my brethren, let them have from us when we meet with his prayers, his ſermons, his ſayings, let us ſet <hi>Aſterisks</hi> in the Margent, and the finger of a hand to point them out to ſpecial obſervation.

               <p>AND thus of the tranſition to our Saviours Supplication, <hi>Theſe words ſpake Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The manner of preſenting it to God the Father, or if you will, the carriage of our Saviour in it, comes now in order to be handled. <hi>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid.</hi> And here you have his geſture, and expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. His geſture firſt, he lifted up his eyes to heaven while he made it. And in the next place his expreſſion, he did not meditate, or think it only, but he ſaid it, his Prayer was not mental only, but it was a vocal prayer, <hi>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe (my brethren) it was uſual with our Saviour to pray with eyes erected, and lift up to heaven; as I might give you many inſtances out of the Scripture. And out of queſtion it proceeded from the zeal and earneſtneſs of his affections, and from the fixedneſs, and the intention of his thoughts, he being as it were, withdrawn from the earth, and from thoſe lower things, and wholly taken up to heaven, while he prayed. He was no longer here below, no, he was above with God, while he was exerciſed in this duty.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is obſerved of the <hi>Publican,</hi> that he was contrary to Chriſt, in this regard, <hi>viz.</hi> in the external geſture of his body. Our Saviour pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as you have heard, with eyes erected, and lift up to heaven; The <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> with eyes dejected and caſt downward to the earth, and yet this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage alſo ſeems to be approved, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. The <hi>Publican</hi> (ſaies the <hi>Evangeliſt) would not lift up ſo much as his eyes to heaven, but ſmote his breaſt, ſaying, God be mercifull to me a Sinner.</hi> And truly both theſe geſtures have their uſe in prayer, the one to manifeſt a repentance, the other to declare our faith. The one to ſhew that we are caſt down in our ſelves, the other to diſcover that we are rayſed, and lifted up to God. But it became not Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to pray in ſuch a poſture as that wretched creature did, becauſe he had no ſin in him, and conſequently no ſhame, nothing to caſt him down or hinder him from looking up with boldneſs, and with confidence to God the Father. And hence he prayed not like the <hi>Publican</hi> in a dejected way, but <hi>lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That leads us to the ſecond thing conſidered, Chriſt did not meditate, or think his prayer only, but he ſaid it. His prayer was not mental on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but it was a vocal prayer, <hi>he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid, Father, the hour is come,</hi> and ſo on: Its true indeed that as a man may ſay, and yet not pray, he may utter good petitions, and ſpeak a form of Specious words to God, and yet he may not pray indeed, ſo as to find acceptance
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46169:22"/>
and ſucceſs with God: So on the other ſide, a man may pray, and yet yet not ſay, that is, not uſe the voice at all, nor utter any words to God in prayer. And therefore it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, that he cried to God,</hi> when he was ſilent. And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Spirit tells us that he makes requeſt to God ſometimes, <hi>with ſighs and groans,</hi> that are not, yea, <hi>that cannot be expreſſed,</hi> Rom. 8.26. So that a man may make requeſt to God without expreſſion, as well by meaning as by ſpeaking: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added in the following verſe, <hi>God knows the meaning of the Spirit,</hi> that is, he underſtands it, and accepts it. <hi>David</hi> prefers the meditation of his heart, as well as the petitions of his mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>ult. Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore in another place, he ſaith of God, <hi>Lord, thou haſt heard the deſire of the humble,</hi> Pſalm 10.17. So that you ſee that Prayer is not tyed to the expreſſion of the tongue; For even Ejaculations that are ſwift, and ſudden wiſhes darted from the heart to God, the inward anhelations, thirſtings, longings, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, meanings of the Soul, are honoured in the Scripture with the name of prayer. Such mentall prayers we have cauſe to think our Saviour ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times offered to his Father when he was alone.</p>
               <p>But here his prayer, it ſhould ſeem, was vocal, he uttered it aloud that his Apoſtles and Diſciples who were about him, at that time, might hear it. <hi>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, this you ſee the Holy-Ghoſt takes ſpecial notice of, as a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and a memorable thing. He doth not only tell us, that our Saviour prayed, and what his prayer was, from the beginning of it to the end. But he acpuaints us alſo with the manner, and the circumſtances of his prayer. He ſhews us what his geſture was, he tells us how he placed his eyes, and how he uſed his voice in prayer. Theſe things may ſeem but ſmall matters, and we may look upon them as petty, inconſiderable things: But wherefore doth the Holy Ghoſt ſo carefully take notice of them, and ſet them down in writing for the Church, unleſs they be of ſome weight, and ſome conſideration? Methinks he intimateth thus much to us.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That there ſhould be Conſideration had, not only of the matter, but even of the circumſtances, the very geſture, and the utterance of a prayer.</head>
                  <p>The Spirit of God, you ſee, doth not let paſs ſuch things as theſe, no, he obſerveth them exactly; And therefore ſurely, ſo ſhould we too. He ſets them down for our uſe, and there is ſomewhat to be learned from them; <hi>For whatſoever things are written, are written for our learning,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is uſual in the Scripture, not only to expreſs the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that the Saints have made, and that Chriſt himſelf hath made, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to deſcribe their outward carriage, and behaviour in them, which ſhews that there is ſomething even in that too. Sometimes our Saviour Chriſt is noted to caſt himſelf proſtrate upon the earth in prayer, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>he fell upon his face, and prayed.</hi> And ſometimes to look up to heaven, as you have it in my text; So alſo when he raiſed <hi>Lazarus,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:46169:22"/>
John</hi> 11.41. <hi>he lifted up his eyes;</hi> and when he healed the deaf man, <hi>he looked up to heaven,</hi> Mark 7.34. Sometimes he only ſigheth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in prayer, and we hear of no expreſſion in the ſore-alleadged text. <hi>He Sighed,</hi> you muſt conceive in ſome petition which he then put up to God, and ſaid to the deaf man, <hi>Epphatah, be opened.</hi> Sometimes he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters words alſo, which are audible to others, as I might give you divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of his ſtorie in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>So for the Saints, ſometimes we find them repreſented ſitting, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18. Sometimes ſtanding up, as, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.2. and ſometimes kneeling in their Prayers, as that is very uſual in the Scriptures. Sometimes we find them ſpeaking words in prayer, and ſometimes uſing meditation only, as <hi>David</hi> ſo divides his prayer in the fore-alleadged text, <hi>into the words of his mouth, and the meditations of his heart,</hi> and prayes that both may find acceptance with the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>ult.</hi> And all theſe wayes the holy Ghoſt takes ſpecial notice of, and leaves upon record for our inſtruction, by which he teaches us that there ſhould be conſideration had not only of the matter, but even of the circumſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What then, it may be you will ask me, do our geſtures, or doth the manner of preſenting our requeſts to God, the outward manner with the voice, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, fall under the command of God? Are we expreſly bound to pray in ſuch a poſture, in ſuch a way, or manner of expreſſion? Do theſe external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances appertain to Gods worſhip?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, No, in no caſe, the difference is wide between the bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, and the Spiritual ſervice. We are not under any ceremonial Law that binds us to an outward circumſtance, to a place, or to a poſture, as the Jews of old were. And yet there ſhould be due conſideration had, not only of the matter, but even of the circumſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that eſpecially upon theſe two grounds. For,</p>
                  <p>Theſe outward circumſtances may in caſe promote the ſpiritual ſervice.<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> The very geſture, or the utterance of a prayer, may help ſometimes to raiſe and quicken the affection, which is the life and Soul of prayer. Our hearts are naturally dead, and ſtupid, and prophane, and ſtand in need of all good outward helps to ſtir up zeal, and reverence, and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them. And to this end, they have been uſed by the Saints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that not only in their publike, but even in their private, and their ſecret prayers, when their ſubmiſs and humble geſtures could have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon other men; And conſequently had no other uſe, but to help their own hearts. As <hi>Daniel</hi> was exact in this, <hi>even in his chamber,</hi> and it is carefully recorded, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>He kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed.</hi> He prayed three times a day, and ſtill he was in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. And it is noted of our Saviour that he kneeled down and prayed, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.10. and this was in Private too. So that he did it not with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to others; and therefore a moſt eminent and worthy man obſerveth, that undoubtedly he ſaw he needed it himſelf: And if that be admitted, aſſuredly we need ſuch helps and furtherances much more.</p>
                  <p>Theſe outward circumſtances if they do not further, yet they expreſs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> the ſpiritual ſervice. They teſtifie the ſorrow, the humility, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the devotion of the heart, and the reverence of the ſoul. As in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46169:23"/>
my text, our Saviours <hi>lifting up his eyes to heaven,</hi> diſcovered where his heart was. And therefore, humble geſtures are eſpecially required in publike worſhip, becauſe God will be honoured in the ſight of others, yea, they are ſometimes put for all his ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee ſhall bow to me.</hi> And ſeeing hypocrites in matter of the worſhip and the ſervice of the Lord, are alwayes ready to pretend they have as good hearts as the very beſt; Therefore the Lord is wont to call ſo often, and ſo earneſtly for the external Service of the body, and that in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament as well as in the old, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glorifie God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>and that not in your Spirit only, but in your body alſo, which is Gods.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Now is it ſo, that there ſhould be conſideration had not only of the matter, but even of the circumſtances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then,</p>
                  <p>Firſt it ſerves to let them ſee their error, and miſtake, who utterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuch things as theſe are; who take no notice of their outward carriage in ſuch holy duties, but rather look upon it as a thing below the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chriſtian, who ſhould be wholly, and entirely taken up with their ſpiritual ſervice; And yet as you have heard, the Holy-Ghoſt takes notice of a geſture, a caſt of the eye in Prayer; and ſets it down in white and black, we need not doubt, for our information.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs the great defect is on the other ſide, men are imployed ſo much about the form, the ſurface, and the outſide of religious duties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, that they neglect the main buſineſs; Their thoughts are exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far about the geſture of their body, the compoſure of their words, the framing of their voices, and the like, eſpecially in publike prayer, that they have no regard at all to the inward and ſpiritual ſervice. The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work is infinitely more eaſie, and there is much more oſtentation in it: And hence it is that the greater part of men are wholly taken up with that which they themſelves can do, and being done, procure them moſt applauſe from other men.</p>
                  <p>But yet their placing all in forms, and outſides, and minding nothing elſe in holy duties, doth not juſtifie at all our running off to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream upon the other ſide. No it is poſſible that even as hypocrites and rotten-hearted wretches may be ſo intent upon the outſide, that they have no regard unto the inſide; So on the other ſide the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and ſincereſt Chriſtians, may be ſo intent upon the inſide, that they have no regard at all unto the outſide. They may ſo far look after the affection, and the zeal, and the devotion of the heart (which is indeed the main thing to be looked to) that they may have no thought at all of the External circumſtances of their prayers, the geſture, or the manner of their utterance, which are Conſiderable notwithſtanding (as I have made it plain enough) and therefore to be wholly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of them is a failing, yea though it ſhould be in the beſt of Gods people.</p>

I mean the carriage of the ſoul and ſpirit, the inward fervor and humility, affection, and devotion of the heart, without which all the reſt is worth nothing; But yet let not the geſture of your bodies, the utterance of your voice in prayer be utterly neglected by you, concerning both of which, becauſe I find them in my Text, I ſhall give you ſome directions.</p>
                  <p>As for the geſture of your bodies, I ſhall commend theſe few things.</p>
                  <p>We are not bound to all the ſelf-ſame geſtures, which were in uſe among <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the people of the Lord of old; we read that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders when they were routed at the Siege of <hi>Ai,</hi> and came before the Ark of God to pray, <hi>they rent their cloaths and put duſt upon their heads,</hi> Joſhua 7.16. <hi>And</hi> Hezekiah <hi>when he came into the houſe of God to pray, at the time when</hi> Senacherib <hi>beſieged</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>he rent his cloaths, and put on Sack-cloath,</hi> Iſa. 37.1. And this they did, not that theſe faſhions were appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the worſhip of the Lord, but becauſe they were in uſe in thoſe times and thoſe places, to expreſs their grief by; So in the ſelf-ſame place in <hi>Joſhua, they fell down to the ground upon their faces when they prayed.</hi> And ſo did Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. Not that this geſture was peculiar to this piece of ſervice, but it was taken from the civil uſage of the Country, becauſe this was their way of ſhewing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to ſuperiors, as you may ſee, <hi>Ruth</hi> 2.10. And therefore we do well and ſuitably to the directions and examples of the Scripture, that we take up ſuch geſtures only in our prayers as are uſual in our Country, to expreſs our ſorrow and dejection, or elſe our civil reverence and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe reverend geſtures which we uſe in prayer ſhould be moſt obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in publike. There may more liberty be taken in private, and in ſecret, then there may in publike and open prayer, both in the uſe of outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and in the forbearance of them. Some geſtures may be uſed in private prayer which would become us ill in publike, in which we ſhould not go remarkably beyond the reſt of the Aſſembly for fear and danger of hypocriſie: And geſtures on the other ſide may be forborn in ſome caſe in private prayer, which yet in publike ought not to be ſo; For evermore in publike (as far as it is poſſible) our geſture muſt be ſuch as may expreſs ſome reverence, and devotion, that we may honour God before the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that our outward poſture may not carry in it an appearance of a ſleight eſteem of God, and of his ſervice; whereas in private there is greater freedom, becauſe indeed there is no need of ſuch Caution.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly this muſt be continually heeded both in publike, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> private, that the geſtures which we uſe be ſuch, as that we do not hinder, but rather further the ſpiritual ſervice. It were far better to abate of the reverence of our geſture, then the affection of our heart. It were far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to ſtand in prayer, then that by the diſeaſe and trouble of the other poſture he ſhould be diſtracted, and conſequently his devotion, and his heart ſhould fall. That may be allowed the weak in this regard, which would not be convenient in the ſtrong. The bodily exerciſe; be it of what kind it will, is but a means to the ſpiritual ſervice. The end is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46169:24"/>
then the means; and muſt be more regarded then the means. I muſt not uſe the means but for the end, ſo far as they are ſerviceable to the end. And much leſs, muſt I uſe the means aganiſt the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> We muſt be very wary that the outward geſture (eſpecially in publike prayer) do not exceed the inward affection, and that we make not ſhew of more without then there is indeed within; for if we do, there is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſie; Such duties are not done in truth, when there is more in ſhew, and in appearance, then there is in ſubſtance. If either of the two be lower then the other, it were far better that the outward expreſſion were lower then the inward affection, then that the inward, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It were far better that the geſture came ſhort of the heart, then that the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not good to compaſs God about with lies, meer ſhews do never pleaſe in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>This for the geſture of your bodies when you pray: A word or two for your direction touching the uſe, or the omiſſion of the voice in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And here the firſt thing that I offer is, Thoſe prayers that are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, whether in the family, or the aſſembly, wherein one is the mouth of many to the Lord, muſt of neceſſity be vocall: ſo was our Saviours in my text, you ſee, he prayed with his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and therefore did no only form a prayer in his heart, but expreſſed it with his mouth; he did not only think, but ſpeak, that they might hear. <hi>He lifted up his eyes to heaven, and ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The voice is not of abſolute neceſſity in private prayer; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men, who having bodies are endued with ears and ſenſes, know not our meaning, otherwiſe then by our words, yet God who is himſelf a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, knows the meaning of our ſpirits. Sighs may find audience, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him; inward and mental ſupplications may be in ſome caſe more fit then vocal.</p>
                  <p>But yet, if other circumſtances will permit, in which your Chriſtian prudence muſt direct you, uſe your voices. We ſhall obſerve it to have been the uſual practiſe of the Saints to ſpeak in prayer, yea, in private prayer, as our Saviour did, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.39. God made the tongue aſwel as other members of the body, and therefore will be ſerved with this, as well as them. And ſo the Prophet <hi>David</hi> praiſed God with the beſt member that he had, which ſome expound to be his tongue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>bleſs we God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 3.9. It is ſometimes a quickning to the heart, and ſtirreth up the dead affections to greater fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency, and zeal, which by continuing in a mental ſupplication would be apt to languiſh and decay; It keepeth in the heart from wandring, by binding it to give exact attendance on the tongue, to furniſh it with matter and expreſſion; whereas in mental prayer, it is more apt to ſlide away, and run a roving unobſerved. Howbeit here I ſhall not peremptorily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe; in certain caſes to omit the voice is more expedient, and therefore I ſhall ſhut up all, and leave it to your Chriſtian prudence to direct you, to pitch upon that way and method of preſenting your requeſts to God, which ye will find moſt to conduce to the affectionate, ſpiritual and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly performance of the duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:46169:24"/>And thus of the tranſition to our Saviours ſupplication, together with the manner of preſenting it to God the Father, both his geſture and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to enter on the Prayer which he makes; and here I ſhall take notice only of theſe two things, the Object of it, and the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>The Object of it, or the Perſon whom he preſents it to, you ſee, is God the Father: or to come a little nearer, God his Father, ſo he ſtiles him in the entrance of his Prayer, <hi>Father, the hour is come, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſame phraſe he uſes all along, as you ſhall ſee, if you ſurvey it from the beginning of it to the end.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, he gives him once the attribute of Holy, and once the attribute of Righteous Father, but this is ſtill the appellation that he uſes, and from whence he never varies. If he calls him any thing, he calls him <hi>Father.</hi> And in this notion he conſiders him, while he is putting up his prayer to him; and therefore this you ſee (my brethren) is the firſt word that he uſes, when he ſets himſelf to pray, <hi>Father, the hour is come, &amp;c.</hi> I make theſe addreſſes to thee, as a Father, I look upon thee as a Father ſtill, while I am pouring out my prayer to thee; and therefore he reviews the appellation ever and anon, on all occaſions; ſo that the point to be obſerved is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> God is the Father of the Lord Chriſt, and ſo he apprehended him, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, when he was making his Petitions to him.</head>
                  <p>The point, you ſee, hath two branches: Firſt, God is the Father of the Lord Chriſt; then Chriſt did look upon him as a Father, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him as a Father, when he was making his Petition to him.</p>
                  <p>God is the Father of the Lord Chriſt; I ſhall not waſte away my time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to prove it, it is ſo clearly, and expreſly taught in Scripture every where: you ſhall obſerve them often owning one another under the relation of a Father, and a Son. Sometimes the Father owns our Saviour for his Son, and this he doth by an immediate atteſtation out of heaven it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Lo, a voice from heaven, ſaying, This is my beloved Son:</hi> Me thinks he ſeems to point him out, to ſpecial obſervation, <hi>This is he.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes our Saviour on the other ſide acknowledges, and owns the Father, and this is very uſual upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how is God the Father of the Lord Chriſt? or in what ſenſe doth he call him Father here? no otherwiſe then we do? this will need a little opening.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To clear it to you in a word or two, you muſt conſider, that God the Father hath two ſorts of ſons, either he hath ſons made, or elſe he hath ſons begotten. He hath ſons made, and that both by Creation and Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt, he is ſaid to be a Father by Creation; and thus he hath a kind of univerſal Fatherhood to all the Creatures. And therefore the Apoſtle ſtiles him, <hi>the Father of all,</hi> Eph. 4.6. He is in this regard, the Father of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46169:25"/>
our bodies, and the Father of our Spirits; The Father of our bodies mediatly and virtually Created, in the loins of <hi>Adam.</hi> The Father of our Spirits, immediatly, and actually infuſed by himſelf; with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction only, that there are men, who, under him, are the Fathers of our Fleſh; but he himſelf alone is the Father of our Spirits, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle lays it down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9. And in this ſenſe, he is the Father of the Angels, who were immediately framed, and created by his own Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand, and therefore are called <hi>the ſons of God, Job</hi> 1.6. This Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of God (as I have ſaid) is univerſal, and all the Creatures have a ſhare in it; ſo that even all of them may call him Father too, as well as we, and uſe the Prophets words, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Have we not all one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? hath not one God created us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus, our Saviour as a Creature, hath an intereſt in the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of God. And here he hath an Intereſt above others, though not an intereſt without others, <hi>For he is the firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                  <p>And as this Father hath his Sons made by creation, ſo he hath Sons made by Adoption, by which a remnant of Mankinde are ſet apart, out of the free and undeſerved Grace of God, to be the children, and the heirs of God.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſee not, why our Saviour Chriſt, as Man, ſhould not come in for one of the Adopted Sons of God; for one (I mean) above the reſt, though not for one among the reſt; ſo that he hath his Priviledge in this regard, as the Apoſtle intimates, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>God hath predeſtinated us to the adoption of Children by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Perhaps the meaning may be this, firſt he hath adopted Chriſt as man, and as a creature, and then he hath adopted us by him, as part of Jeſus Chriſt, and as Members of his body.</p>
                  <p>And as this Father hath his Sons made, both by creation, and adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo he hath his ſons begotten, and his ſons born; for both of theſe expreſſions we ſhall finde in Scripture. <hi>He hath begotten us,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Of his own will begat he us,</hi> Jam. 1.18. <hi>And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever loves him that begat, loves him that is begotten,</hi> 1 John 5.1.</p>
                  <p>And thus, our Saviour alſo is begotten of the Father; and here he hath his priviledge, and his preheminence as well as in the reſt; <hi>For he is the firſt-begotten of the Father,</hi> Heb. 1.6. when he bringeth in the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into the world: herein he is above Men, yea he is above Angels: <hi>For unto which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day, &amp;c.</hi> And when he bringeth in, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>And let all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its true, that even we that are his Children are begotten, as Chriſt is; he is begotten from eternity, but we in time. He is begotten ſo that he partaketh of his ſubſtance, and of his very eſſence, that begets him: We are indeed partakers of the Divine nature, but not by communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eſſence of God, but by participation of the properties of God. He is begotten of the Father perſonally taken, whereas none of us are ſo. Its true we are the Sons of God, begotten by an Act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but we are not the Sons of God the Father (taken as diſtinct from both the other perſons of the God-head) begotten by an act within, as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46169:25"/>
Chriſt is. He is begotten by a proper and peculiar act of God the Father, in an unſpeakable communication of the Eſſence of the God-head from the Father to the Son, which we are better able to admire then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; for as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>who can declare his generation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this for clearing of the former member of the point, God is the Father of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond, that Chriſt did look upon him as a Father, and apprehend him as a Father when he was making his Petitions to him. You ſee it evidently, and demonſtratively in my Text. This is the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he gives him in this prayer, all along, as I have noted to you heretofore. Its true, that God is frequently in Scripture ſtiled the God of Chriſt, as ſee the place, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>God even thy God;</hi> and Chriſt doth ſometimes call him his God, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.17. <hi>I aſcend to my God,</hi> but to the beſt of my remembrance he never calls him ſo in prayer. He comes not to him by the name of <hi>his God,</hi> but by the name of his <hi>Father,</hi> that is the ſweet, and precious name that he delights to call him by, when he is pouring out his prayers to him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall add no more for proof, the point is plain, <hi>God is the father of the Lord Chriſt, and ſo he apprehended him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is God the Father of the Lord Chriſt? this then may ſerve for ſweet <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>1</label> and precious conſolation to the Saints, and to thoſe that are in Chriſt. For if God be Chriſts Father, then he is their Father too: And this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt himſelf acknowledges to his Diſciples for their comfort. <hi>I aſcend to my Father, and your Father. My Father,</hi> but ſo that he is yours too: firſt mine, and then yours. My intereſt indeed, in this reſpect, is ſomewhat higher and above yours, but it is not without yours: nay, to ſay truth, my intereſt is for yours. God is my Father that he may be yours in me. Oh my beloved, what melting joy and comfort is here for every member of the Lord Chriſt, in regard of this relation; I give you but a hint in three particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, being the ſons of God in Chriſt, we may be ſure that he will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hear us in, and by, and through Chriſt. He always hears his ſon Chriſt, and never puts him off with a denial; <hi>Thou art my ſon, this day, &amp;c. Ask of me, and I will give thee.</hi> Pſal. 2.7. and this our Saviour Chriſt himſelf profeſſes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>1.4. and as the Father always hears his ſon Chriſt, ſo he doth always hear his Sons in Chriſt. And truly, if the firſt be once admitted, the latter follows unavoidably. For Chriſt the eldeſt Son is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor for his brethren; in all their regular requeſts he never faileth to put in with them: ſo that they cannot be denied, unleſs he be denied too; Chriſt and they muſt either ſtand or fall together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, being Sons of God in Chriſt, we may be confident he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> will provide for us. He hath provided very well for Chriſt, he is not his Son only, but he is his Heir too; yea, he is heir of all without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. And as Chriſt is the Son and Heir of God, ſo we are ſons and heirs of God in Chriſt: there is not a younger brother of us. <hi>Thou art no more a ſervant but a ſon,</hi> Gal. 4.7. <hi>And if a ſon, then an heir of God through Chriſt.</hi> If Sons of God through Chriſt, then Heirs of God through Chriſt too. <hi>If we be ſons, then alſo heirs,</hi> Rom. 8.17. yea we are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46169:26"/>
heirs of all as Chriſt is; and therefore it is added preſently, <hi>Heirs of God, joynt-heirs with Chriſt.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, is not Heir to any thing, but we are joynt-heirs, and have a joynt-right with him; there is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of our riches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, being Sons of God, we may be confident he will protect us; Fathers uſe to protect their children, if they can; God can, and therefore will. As <hi>Naomi</hi> laid <hi>Ruths</hi> childe in her boſom, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4.16. ſo God lays his children, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.11. and that is certainly a ſafe place. And as the Eagle ſpreads her wings over her young, and carries them upon her wings, <hi>Prov.</hi> 32.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. ſo God throws his children under the wings of his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and carries them above the reach of danger. This is very ſweet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; be your troubles what they will, you have a Father that is able to ſecure you, that is very tender of you, that hath ſet a guard upon you, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. Pſal.</hi> 34.7.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Why then I ſay, as the Apoſtle, <hi>He is the Lord of all,</hi> Gal. 4.1. <hi>He is not a ſervant in the houſe, but a Son over the houſe,</hi> Heb. 3.6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt be obeyed, and ſerved, according to the Pſalmiſts Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord.</hi> Well then, my brethren, let us think of this, and let us hearken to that Counſel and advice of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Take my yoke,</hi> my ſervice on you. Brethren let me engage you all this day for this Lord, and his ſervice, let me perſwade you to receive him for the Lord your righteouſneſs. Not to call him Lord only, but to take him for your Lord, and to uſe him as your Lord, and to yield him all that ſervice and obedience which the name calls for.</p>
               <p>Ah, my Beloved, let us not do in this regard as the greater part of Chriſtians in name and in profeſſion do. Let us not wear the badge and cognizance of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſay, he is our Lord and Maſter, and the like; and in the mean time never do his will, nor take any pains at all in his ſervice: For this is but to deal with Chriſt as the perfidious Jews did, to put a purple robe upon him, and to bow down before him, and to call him, <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and in the ſelf-ſame breath to buffet him, and ſpit upon him. But as we call him Lord, ſo let us carry and demean our ſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him as our Lord and Maſter, and let us yield to him that obedience which is due to him.</p>
               <p>And to this end, let us conſider what engagements lye upon us to draw us, and to hold us to the ſervice of this Lord: which I ſhall briefly lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you as motives to perſwade.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is an Engagement of Creation, he is <hi>the image of the inviſible God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>The firſt born of every creature,</hi> that is, the Lord of every creature, for the firſt born is Lord of all. And
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46169:26"/>
why the Lord of every creature? You have the reaſon in the following words, <hi>For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth.</hi> All things were made by him, and therefore it is fit that all ſhould ſerve him. Nay, my Beloved, they were not made by him only, but they were made for him too, as it is added there in that place; <hi>all things were created by him, and for him.</hi> By his power, and for his uſe. And therefore if we be not uſeful to him, if we do not ſerve him, we croſs the very end of our creation. The brutiſh, and unreaſonable creatures ſerve him in their kind and meaſure, and therefore <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>that all things ſerve him.</hi> But we are bound to ſerve him much more, becauſe in our Creation we received more from him. He made us Lords of all his creatures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>at we might have no Lord but him. He made the whole creation to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us, that we might be the more engaged, and the better able to be ſerviceable to himſelf; that we might ſerve him for it all, that we might ſerve him with it all. He put all things under us, and truly we are bound the more (my Brethren) to be under him, and ſubject to him; he made us men, he gave us reaſon, which he gave not to other creatures; the greater reaſon have we to obey him, and to improve our parts and gifts in his ſervice. Indeed we cannot choſe but ſee that it is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the world, that as we have all from him, ſo we ſhould uſe all for him.</p>
               <p>The next is an engagement of Redemption which binds us to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the Lord. As he is the Lord that made us, ſo he is the Lord that bought us, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. <hi>He purchaſed us</hi> (my Brethren) us I mean, that are his own, at a very dear rate, and therefore it is juſt that we ſhould ſerve him; eſpecially ſince it is evident that this was his intention in his purchaſe. He bought us out of Sins and Satans hands, not that we might be abſolutely free from all commands, but that we might be his ſervants. <hi>He gave himſelf for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Tit.</hi> 2.14. that was the purchaſe that he made, a very dear one you will ſay: <hi>He gave himſelf for us:</hi> to what end? that he might reedeem us from all iniquity, from the dominion and power of ſin. And what now, are we maſterleſs? And are the reins upon our own necks? Now mark what follows preſently, <hi>And purifie us a peculiar people himſelf;</hi> a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to himſelf to ſerve him, and to do his work, and to be very earneſt in it too; <hi>and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people Zealous of good works;</hi> And ſo being free from ſin, we are not left at large (my Brethren) but we became <hi>the ſervants of Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 6 22. This was the End that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and propounded to himſelf in our Redemption; <hi>he dyed for us, that we which live, ſhould henceforth live no longer to our ſelves, but to him that dyed for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.15. <hi>He hath performed the mercy promiſed, he hath remembred,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he hath ſaved us from,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 1.74. What, that we might from henceforth be our own men, and live at liberty, and walk according to our own wills? Oh no (my Brethren) but on the other ſide, <hi>that we might ſerve him,</hi> who hath ſaved us, <hi>in holineſs and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all the daies of our lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is an Engagement of Covenant-obligation; we are his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſervants, and therefore we are bound to ſerve him; if we run away
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46169:27"/>
from him, we are Covenant-breakers with him. Indeed we that are born of thoſe that are in Covenant with him, are born his Covenant-ſervants in a ſenſe: For ſuch as the condition of the Parent is, (Beloved) ſuch is the condition of the child, as to outward priviledge, and as to outward duty too. And hence it is perhaps that <hi>David</hi> ſaith to God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 116.16. <hi>O Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am thy ſervant.</hi> My ſervant, might the Lord reply, Why how ſo? why ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I am the ſon of thy hand-maid.</hi> So we whoſe parents were within the Covenant, were born to Chriſt in ſome reſpect, for we were born within his family, and ſo (to outward view and cognizance) belong to his houſhold.</p>
               <p>But this is but an outward thing, ſome of us have gone further yet, and made a Covenant with the Lord to ſerve him, we were in Covenant all of us with ſin by nature, and ſo with death and hell we were at an agreement too. But ſome of us have utterly diſſolved that Covenant, and entred into Covenant with the Lord Chriſt. We are bound, let us obey, now we have made this Covenant with him, we are the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to ſerve him, and the greater is our ſin if we run away from him.</p>

                  <hi>Is God the Father of our Lord Chriſt? The greater is his love to us, that he ſhould give Chriſt for us. If he had given but a ſervant, or a friend, it had been much that he ſhould part with either of them for an enemy; but that he ſhould give us his ſon, his own begotten ſon, to ſhame, to puniſhment, to death for us; here is love, and here is mercy with a witneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt (me thinks) knows not which way to expreſs it, and therefore leaves it to the largeſt heart, and the vaſteſt underſtanding to gueſs at it, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world.</hi> So, how? I cannot tell you, it ſwallows up my apprehenſions and expreſſions: And therefore I muſt leave it to your ſelves to think of it, and reach after it.</p>
               <p>And truly (my Beloved) did we weigh it well in our adviſed and deliberate thoughts, we ſhould be carried out beyond our ſelves in an Extaſie of wonder. What (my Beloved,) that when the Father had but one begotten Son by nature, and one that was ſo well like him, the very picture of his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one whom he loved dearly, <hi>in whom his very ſoul delighted,</hi> that he ſhould give him forth out of his boſom for ſuch wretches as we are? That he could not ſpare his Son, that he might ſpare his Enemies; <hi>behold what love the Father hath declared in this!</hi> Here is love to be ſpoken of, and to be wondred at in all ages. And thus far of the uſes of the former member of the point. Proceed we now to make ſome application of the latter.</p>

                  <hi>Is it ſo (my Brethren) that as God is the Father of the Lord Chriſt; So Chriſt did apprehend him as a Father, and look upon him as a Father when,</hi> &amp;c. Then let us alſo apprehend him ſo, and look upon him ſo, who are the ſons of God in Chriſt, when we come to God in prayer: Let us preſent our ſupplications to him under the notion of a Father, as Chriſt did; Chriſt is in this reſpect our Pattern and Example, whom we ought to follow. We are required, you know, to be followers of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in all his imitable actions, and this is one of thoſe actions. We ought to walk as he walked, and to pray as he prayed. And therefore as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:46169:27"/>
was to pray to God himſelf in this language, to come to God as to a Father: So he hath taught us alſo ſo to pray in the very ſame language, to come to God as to a Father, as he did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. <hi>After this manner pray ye, Our Father which art in heaven.</hi> So that we have in this, you ſee, the Precept and Example of the Lord Chriſt; his Precept in the cited place, and his Example in my Text. And therefore let us learn this leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of him, ſince he is pleaſed to teach us both waies, both by Precept and Example. When we are making our addreſſes to the Lord in prayer, let us endeavour to apply unto our ſelves the love and father-hood of God in Jeſus Chriſt. Let us not ſatisfie our ſelves with a general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that he is a gracious Father to all his ſons and daughters in the Lord Chriſt. But let us ſtrive for a diſtinct and a particular aſſurance that he is our own Father, that he is ſo to us in ſpecial, and that we are among the number of his children. That we may look upon him ſo, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently call him ſo, when we are pouring out our prayers to him, and ſo expect the love and mercy of a Father from him.</p>
               <p>And to this very End, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>The Spirit of the Son is ſent abroad into our hearts.</hi> To what End? Why, to make us cry <hi>Abba Father, Gal.</hi> 4.6. That is to make us pray to God, as to a Father, while others come to God as to a ſtranger, with whom they have no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to whom they have no relation. So that you ſee, we have not only the Precept of Chriſt, and the Example of Chriſt, but we have alſo the Spirit of Chriſt, that we may pray in this manner: And therefore in this Faith and confidence, the Saints of God have prayed in Scripture. So did the Church, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs, ſay they, thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Iſrael acknowledge us not, thou art our Father.</hi> It is repeated twice you ſee, and bound with an aſſeveration too, to ſhew the ſtrength and certainty of their aſſurance: And in the ſame perſwaſion we find them praying in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in Verſ. 8. <hi>But now Oh Lord thou art our Father, we are the clay, and thou the Potter, we are the work of thy hands:</hi> And in the ſame aſſurance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo let us pray, when we are making our addreſſes to the throne of grace, let us apply our ſelves to God as to a Father. The benefit and profit of it will be very great, as I ſhall repreſent it to you in a few particulars, which you may look upon as Motives to perſwade.</p>
               <p>This aſſurance will make us bold and confident in our approaches to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the throne of grace, it will make us come to God full of holy reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas if we be deſtitute of this perſwaſion when we are drawing nigh to God, and know not whether we may call him father, yea or no, we ſhall be fearful to approach his preſence, we ſhall make but faint prayers. And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, that by faith in Chriſt, in whom alone God is a Father to his children, that is by this aſſurance that he is ſo to us in ſpecial; <hi>we have boldneſs, we have acceſs with confidence to God, Eph.</hi> 3.11. And this was that which heartened up the Prodigal, and filled his languiſhing and fainting heart with reſolution, <hi>I will ariſe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>and go to my Father:</hi> he had been long debating, it ſhould ſeem, and ruminating on the buſineſs in his wavering thoughts: His late miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, no queſtion, were a great diſheartening to him, ſo that he knew not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46169:28"/>
what to do. But at laſt he comes to this, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father;</hi> he is my Father, and I am his own Son, and there is pitty and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in a Father to a Son, at leaſt to a returning Son, though an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy one, as I have been: And therefore let my faults, and my diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be what they will, I will ariſe, and go to him: And truly while we apprehend the Lord to be a Judge, and not a Father; or if a Father, not to us, but other men, we find but ſmall encouragement to come to him. But when we look upon him as a Father, yea, as our Father, in the Lord Chriſt, this makes us come with boldneſs to him. This cauſes us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Almighty, and not to look divertedly, but to lift up our face to God, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As this aſſurance will make us bold and confident, ſo it will make us earneſt and importunate with God; It will enable us to pray and not to faint. When we conſider, we are dealing with a Father, we ſhall hang about him; when he ſeems to throw us off, we ſhall tug, and wreſtle with him, we ſhall take no denyal from him. Oh Lord thou art our Father, we pray thee hear us, pitty us, relieve us, for we are thine own children. A man is never earneſt and importunate with one, of whoſe affections he hath no perſwaſion, and they that have not this aſſurance, preſent but cold and ſpiritleſs petitions and requeſts to God. But they that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him as a Father, as one that hath ſo near relation, and ſuch dear affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them, as one whoſe bowels of compaſſion yern towards them in their miſeries and wants, they will keep no ſilence, they will give him no reſt, till he have anſwered them in mercy, till he have given them the deſire of their hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This aſſurance will make us hopefull of audience, and ſucceſs with God. <hi>Can a woman forget her child, and not have compaſsion on the Son of her womb?</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 99.65. Can ſhe deny him when he begs and hangs about her? It is poſſible ſhe may; there may be ſuch a mother in the world, but God is no ſuch Father. No, he hath infinitely more compaſsion on his children. Oh what a matchleſs and unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ground of hope is here, to thoſe that have this ſweet aſſurance that God is their Father! <hi>What man is there, who if his ſon asketh bread</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>will give him a ſtone, or if he ask a fiſh will give him a Serpent?</hi> though the poor child perhaps cannot diſtinguiſh the one from the other: <hi>If ye then being evil; know how to give good things unto your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to them that ask him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And laſtly, this aſſurance will hold us up with matchleſs comfort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively to the defects and imperfections of our prayers. Suppoſe your little tender child ſhould come to any of you that are Fathers, with a liſping ſtammering tongue, moaning for ſomething that he longs to have, would you look angrily upon him, would you chide, and rate him off, and ſend the harmleſs infant crying from your preſence? Conſult with your own hearts and bowels; could you do it? and is not God as pittiful to his, as you are to your children? Alas, he is as tenderly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, that he ſees not their defects, ſo as to ſlight them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them, or their weak endeavours for them. No, as a Father pitties his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46169:28"/>
Children, ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.13. <hi>They are without blame before him in love, Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. Though they have many failings, yet he doth not blame them; ſo great is his love to them, when they look upon their prayers, and find this fault, and that fault, (as truly they have cauſe enough) the comfort is, that God finds no fault; he ſaith that it is well done. And thus he dealt with holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> as himſelf obſerveth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 77.2, 3. He was in ſuch diſtreſs, that he was troubled to remember God; his very heart was overwhelmed within him: a poor prayer you may think that any man could make in ſuch a caſe as that was: And yet that very prayer found acceptance with the Lord; as he ſhews in that place, <hi>I cried unto the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) in the firſt ver. of that Pſalm; and mark what follows, <hi>he gave ear to me.</hi> And thus when we do bungle at his ſervice, the Lord is apt to take it in good part, if we do but what we can; and that becauſe he is our Father; which if it be conſidered, cannot chooſe but be a very great encouragement and comfort to us. But you will interpoſe and ſay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps here is encouragement indeed, and pretious comfort, if we can come to God in prayer with this aſſurance, that he is our Father: but how ſhall we attain to this aſſurance? What are the evidences that we may relye upon in this particular, which if we find them in our ſelves, we may be confident to ſpeak to God as to a father; we may be bold to cry Abba Father to him?</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay down a few, and make them as diſtinguiſhing, and clear as I am able, to help you in this great buſineſs.</p>
               <p>If God be your Father, and you be his children, you are very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> much like him, you reſemble God your Father; Jeſus Chriſt his eldeſt ſon is the very picture of him, as we are wont to ſay, the expreſs of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers perſon. They are ſo like in all reſpects, that he that knoweth one of them, cannot but know the other too. The reſemblance is ſo perfect and ſo abſolute in all reſpects, that in ſeeing one of them, you ſee the other. And hence ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Philip, John</hi> 14 19. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly we that are the younger ſons of God, though we be not ſo like him, yet we are very much like him. And therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created us, Col.</hi> 3.10. And the new man is ſaid to be renewed after God in holineſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24.</p>
               <p>And are you thus conformed to God? do you bear his Image? ſo that every one that ſees you, and obſerves you, may judge who is your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Are you holy as God is? and are you mercifull as God is? and are you perfect in deſire, and endeavour, as your Father that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is perfect? do you love your enemies? do you bleſs them that curſe you? and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you? that you may ſhew your ſelves to be the children of your Father, who makes his Sun to ſhine, his rain to fall upon the evil and the good, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44. are you freely merciful, lending and doing good to thoſe where there is nothing to be hoped for, but unkindneſs for your good will? that you may make it to appear you are the children of the higheſt, who is kind to the unthankfull
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46169:29"/>
and unkinde, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.35. Theſe are good evidences of your intereſt in the Father-hood of God. But if you be prophane, and vicious, and cruel, and unmerciful, as the greater number are; I may ſay to ſuch as you are, as once our Saviour to the wicked Jews, <hi>You are of your Father the Devil, and his works you do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If God be your Father, as you bear your Fathers Image, ſee you have your Fathers Spirit. The Spirit of the Father, is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calls the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we cry, <hi>Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15. So that if we be Sons, we have this Spirit poured out upon us.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, that every one almoſt pretendeth to the Spirit; and it is evident that many are deceived in this particular. How ſhall we know infallibly, whether the ſpirit which we think we have, be the ſpirit of the Father, yea, or no? Why (my beloved) the Spirit of the Father i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> an active Spirit, where it is, it leadeth men even where it will, it carries them, and guides them in its own way.</p>
               <p>And as many as are led by this Spirit, they are Sons of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Well then, thus far we are clear, if we be the Sons of God, as we have his ſpirit, ſo we are led by his Spirit; <hi>we walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> The fleſh calls, and the ſpirit calls, <hi>This is the way, walk in it.</hi> The fleſh would have us follow it, the ſpirit would have us follow it. And the event is this, if we be the Sons of God; we leave the fleſh, and go after Gods Spirit: <hi>We walk not after, &amp;c.</hi> So then, if you would know whether you be the Sons of God, examine whether you be guided by his ſpirit, yea, or no?</p>
               <p>And this may be diſcovered by the courſe you take, and by the path in which you walk. Gods Spirit guides and leads you always in the way of God, which is preſcribed and chalked out before you in the word of God. And this is clearly and expreſly taught us, in that alledgement of the Covenant mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 36.27. I will put my Spirit upon you, ſaith the Lord to his people. And what ſhall this Spirit do? it ſhall cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and to keep my Commandments, and do them. It ſhall not give you new directions; it ſhall not ſhew you new ways, and new paths, other then thoſe which are beaten out in Scripture, but it ſhall cauſe you to walk in my Statutes. If then you err, and wander from the ways of Gods Statutes, and walk on in your own ways, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the Gentiles: the way of your own hearts, which of your ſelves you chooſe and follow; your ways of drunkenneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> uncleanneſs, prophanation of Gods holy day, &amp;c. if you walk in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> a way of cruelty and malice, and run greedily after the error of <hi>Balaam</hi> for a reward, as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. A way of covetouſneſs and unlawfull gain you are not guided by the Spirit of the Father, but by the ſpirit of the wicked one, which ruleth in the children of diſobedience.</p>
               <p>But if you keep the ways of God, the ways of truth, and love, and holineſs, and peace; the way that is ſo evilly ſpoken of by lewd, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and vitious men; And are no ſooner ſwerved from it in the leaſt degree, but you are crying to the Lord with <hi>Moſes, Lord ſhew us thy

way:</hi> with <hi>David, I am gone aſtray, Lord ſeek thy ſervant;</hi> enquiring of your brethren to direct you, and ſtriving to get in again; you are guided by the ſpirit of your father, and may be confident that you are the ſons of God.</p>
               <p>If God be your Father, and you be his children, you are a company of ſingular and choice people: As you are like your Father, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently like your brethren too: ſo you are unlike other men: you dwell alone, and are not like to other people. And as the ſons of Kings and Nobles, differ from the ſons of other men, they have another kinde of garb, and habit, and behaviour: Even ſo the Sons of God, the King of Kings, do manifeſtly differ from the children of the world. The Lord hath ſingled them, and drawn them out, and put them in another way; ſo that they are men of wonder in the world, their ways are of another faſhion. And this declareth them to be the children of the High God; he owns them only upon this condition, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>Come out</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and be ye ſeparate, and I will be a father to you, and you ſhall be my ſons and daughters,</hi> ſaith the Lord God almighty.</p>
               <p>Now (my beloved) are you thus come out and ſeparated from the world? which lies in wickedneſs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; have you left your old haunts, your old courſes, your old Companions and Aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates with whom you ran out formerly to the ſame exceſs of riot? are you accounted gazing ſtocks, and wonders to the world, becauſe you are ſo different from them in all your ways? And can you ſay in the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your hearts, that this your ſingular and holy walking, is not in ſhew, and in hypocriſie, but in ſincerity, and truth? you may aſſure your ſelves, you are the ſons and daughters of the Lord God Almighty.</p>
               <p>But if you walk according to the courſe and faſhion of the world, if you be carried down the ſtream with the times, and with the places where you live; if you have fellowſhip with the unfruitfull works of darkneſs, hear what the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.10. you have diſcovered whoſe you are, and to whom you appertain. By this the children of God are manifeſt, and the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>If God be your Father, and you be his children: you have a dear affection to thoſe who are his children, as your ſelves are. There is a tender Love, a ſweet agreement between you and your fellow brethren. If any difference fall out, then ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> once to <hi>Lot, Let there be no ſtrife between us, for we are brethren,</hi> Gen. 13.18. <hi>Let brotherly love continue,</hi> Hebr. 1.12. And the defect of this affection, on the other ſide, is an apparent evidence of non-adoption, as you may ſee, 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.10. he that doth not righteouſneſs is not of God (ſaith the Apoſtle) the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, he is not the childe of God, and he that loveth not his brother: what think we then of thoſe, whoſe ſons are they, who hate and trouble and diſquiet thoſe, who are indeed the Sons of God, and work them all the woe and miſchief they can, and that becauſe they are ſo like God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bear the image of God, and the clear impreſſions of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon them?

and the womans ſeed, the Lord hath put an unreconcileable and Endleſs Enmity and Oppoſition. And therefore let not ſuch (while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in this way of oppoſition to the Saints) preſume to come to God, and call him Father. For if they do, they fall into the ſin of <hi>Ananias</hi> in another way, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. they lye to God. And they have cauſe to fear that he will even ſtrike them dead before him.</p>
               <p>But if you find within you working and warm affections to your fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-brethren, if your hearts be mightily and vehemently carried out to ſuch, and that becauſe you ſee the Image of your Father ſhining in them, and even as God is, even ſuch are they in this world; They are ſo like him whom you love tranſcendently, and incomparably more then all the world beſides, that you cannot chooſe but love them, and affect them dearly too, for his ſake, and in reference to him: So that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light is in them, yea all your delight is in them: You find no pleaſure, or complacency in any other Company but ſuch as theirs is: I ſay (my brethren) if you love them thus, and upon this account, it is a comfortable ſign that God is a Father to you, and you may look upon him as a Father, when you are making your petitions to him.</p>

               <p>ANd thus far of the object of our Saviours prayer, or the perſon to whom he preſents it to, and that as you have heard, is God the Father.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to the parts of it, which have been noted to be two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the paties whom he prayes for. In the firſt place he prayeth for himſelf the Head of the Church. And in the ſecond place he prayes for the inferiour Members of the Church.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For himſelf the Head of the Church, he deſireth glorification; Then for the Members of the Church he deſireth confirmation: and that for the Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him, the Members of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Church: or elſe for thoſe who were after to believe by their word, or to be called by their preaching, the Members of the Church to come: as I have ſhewed you formerly, when I drew up a ſhort Analyſis, or reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the whole Chapter.</p>
               <p>We are at this time to begin with that part of our Saviours prayer which concerns himſelf; In which you may take notice with me of theſe three things: the riſe of it, the matter of it, and the reaſons of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt. You have here the riſe of it, from whence our Saviour takes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to preſent it to his Father; <hi>The hour is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, You have the matter of it, or the thing which he deſireth of the Father, and this is that he may be glorified: <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, you have the reaſons of it, with which he preſſeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth this requeſt of his, and they are many and of great importance, as God aſſiſting, you ſhall ſee at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:46169:30"/>At this time I ſhall faſten on the firſt Particular, the riſe of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour, from whence he takes occaſion to preſent it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>The hour is come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The hour is come;</hi> What hour is come? the hour in which the Father had decreed and fore-appointed to glorifie his Son Chriſt: that hour was come, and therefore he deſires his Father to execute his purpoſe now, ſeeing this was his own time.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, the hour which was now at hand, was the hour of Chriſts Paſſion, in which he was abaſed and humbled, as you may ſee he was betrayed almoſt as ſoon as he had done this prayer. And how then could this be the hour, in which he was appointed to be glorified of the Father?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that Chriſt was glorified in ſome reſpect, even while he ſuffered, he triumphed upon the Croſs, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. blotting out the hand-writing that was againſt us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his Croſs; <hi>And having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in it,</hi> that is in the ſame Croſs. The word that the Apoſtle uſes there, alludeth to the faſhion of the Roman Conquerours, whoſe manner was to lead their vanquiſhed Captives bound before their Chariots in a glorious way, the people gratulating their heroick acts and Victories with loud and joyful acclamations. Our Saviour having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers, did ſomewhat Analogical to this, and hence the terms by which thoſe ancient Roman Triumphs were expreſſed, are attributed to him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he made a ſhew of them openly, that is, he brought them to extream diſhonour, and made them ſpectacles of ignominy and reproach, and gazing-ſtocks of ſhame, to men and Angels: and this he did upon the very Croſs. Its true that to a carnal Eye, this was the place of his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; but to an eye of faith, it was the place of his triumphant Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The world ſees nothing but diſhonour in the Croſs of Chriſt, but they that are enlightned, ſee the great work of mans redemption finiſhed there, ſin and his kingdom broken there, and the Devil vanquiſhed, and led captive there, to Chriſts eternal honour, and their eternal ignominy and confufion. So that even with reſpect to this, (this time of ſuffering on the Croſs) our Saviour Chriſt might ſay, <hi>The hour is come, Father, glorifie thy Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or if you look a little further, to the time of his aſcention and entrance into glory, that hour was not far off; and that perhaps our Saviour Chriſt might aim at in my Text. However, this is evident, that that which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth here, he prays may be effected, and accompliſhed in his Fathers time. And this he makes the ground of his Petition, <hi>Father, the hour is come,</hi> the time which thou haſt fore-appointed to glorifie me in; And therefore I beſeech thee do it now; thou haſt a time for this great work of thine, and this is the very time, the very hour, <hi>the hour is come.</hi> Were it not ſo, I would not ſeek it, or deſire it of thee, but ſeeing this is thy ſeaſon, <hi>now Father glorifie thy ſon.</hi> So that the Point ſuggeſted here, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> God hath his time to do his Actions in, and he ſhould not be deſired to do them any other time.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, He hath his times to do his actions in, that is the firſt thing in the Point. He hath his hour, a certain ſet and fixed ſeaſon for any buſineſs that he hath to do: he hath a time for works of Juſtice, and you ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.33. It is time to threſh her (ſaith the Lord of <hi>Babylon.</hi>) And ſo their feet ſhall ſlide in due time, ſpeaking of ungodly men, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35. He hath his time for works of Mercy, as it is obſerved of <hi>Joſeph, Pſal.</hi> 105.18, 19. his feet they hurt with fetters, he was laid in irons, until the time which God had fore-appointed came. And as ſoon as that was come, the Lord ſo ordered things, that the King ſent and looſed him; the Rulers of the people let him go free, as it is added there in that place. And hence the Lord is ſaid to wait in Scripture that he may be gracious, as in that known place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. Now he that waits to do a thing, looks for a fit time: <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe and have mercy upon Sion;</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.13. For the time to favour her, yea, the ſet time is come; ſo that you ſee God hath his time to do his actions in.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond Member of the point, He ſhould not be deſired to do them any other time. This is apparently ſuggeſted in this Petition of our Saviours in my Text. <hi>Father, the hour is come, now glorifie thy Son: q. d.</hi> If thy appointed ſeaſon were not come, I would not ſeek to have thee glorifie me at this time: I would not have thee do it for me now, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this were thy hour; But ſince the conſtituted hour is come, Lord, bring thy purpoſe into act and execution. Our Saviour is in this our pattern, whom we ought to follow. And hence the Saints in their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions have left God to his own time, and ſought for mercies from him in his own ſeaſon. As <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he found by books, that is, the Book of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and other Books, that the appointed return of the Jews out of the Babylonian thraldom and Captivity was neer at hand, he ſet himſelf to ſeek the Lord at that time, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. And <hi>David</hi> in the fore-alledged Text, he prays for mercy to be ſhewed to Sion. But when? when the ſet time was come.</p>
                  <p>I would not ſpend my time in the further confirmation of ſo clear a truth. Let me but add two Reaſons; God hath his time to do his actions in, and he ſhould not be deſired to do them any other time. For, Firſt, Let our deſires be what they will, he will not be prevailed withall to do them any other time. Or Secondly, if we could prevail with him, it were not beſt that he ſhould do them any other time.</p>
                  <p>Let our deſires be what they will, God will not be prevailed withall, to do his works in any other time then that which he hath fore-appointed and decreed: ſo that it were a vain and idle thing to labour to divert him from his own ſeaſon. We that are men, are often turned from our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; we do not that which we reſolve to do, or elſe we do not act it then when we reſolve to do it, becauſe our reſolutions alter; we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded and convinced that ſome other ſeaſon will be better. But
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46169:31"/>
God for his part is not changeable, he is not as man that he ſhould lye, nor as the ſon of man that he ſhould repent; <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.19. That he ſhould ſo repent as man, by changing of his mind, or varying from his former reſolution. And this is that the Pſalmiſt beats upon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. He obſerves all other things and perſons in the world, and finds that they are variable and inconſtant, they are on, and off again; But as for God, he finds it otherwiſe with him; though they be changeable, he is not ſo: No, ſaith the Prophet there, thou art the ſame; and what doth he infer upon it? why therefore all the good, and all the mercy that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, with reference to his people, he will accompliſh in the ſet time. <hi>Thou ſhalt endure O Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and that for ever.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Thou ſhalt ariſe, and have mercy on Sion, for the ſet time is come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God hath his ſet time to do his actions in, and he ſhould not be deſired to do them any other time; becauſe if we could prevail in ſuch a caſe, it were not beſt that he ſhould do them any other time. He always pitcheth on the fit, beſt, and the opportuneſt ſeaſons for his Works: As he hath his times for them, ſo thoſe times are the beſt times, whether they be Works of Juſtice, or of Mercy. And hence the ſeaſon and opportunity in which he doth them both, is ſtiled the due time. For Works of Juſtice, <hi>their feet ſhall ſlide in due time;</hi> Deut. 32.35. For Works of Mercy, <hi>in due time you ſhall reap, if you faint not:</hi> Gal. 6.9. We that are men do uſually miſtake our time, we miſs our opportunity: <hi>Man knoweth not his time,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.12. <hi>and therefore he is ſnared in an evil time, that fals ſuddenly upon him:</hi> He knoweth not the good time, and therefore he is ſnared in an evil time, that comes upon him ſuddenly, as a ſnare upon a Bird, in which he is entangled, and involv'd, and ſo is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of his purpoſe. But it is not ſo with God, he knows his time, and fixes on it, ſo as none but he can do it. And hence is that Expoſtulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Jer. 49.19. <hi>Who will appoint me the time? q.d.</hi> whoever doth it, will be very much miſtaken: The time which I appoint is beſt, and none can do it like me: and therefore certainly if we were able, it were not beſt to turn him from it, nor to prevail with him to do his work in any other time. This ſhall ſuffice for clearing of the Obſervation; proceed we now to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
                  <p>And this may ſerve for Reprehenſion in the firſt place to check and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> cenſure thoſe who take upon them to appoint God a time for execution of his Works of Mercy, or his Works of Juſtice. They do not come to God as our Saviour in my Text, <hi>Father, the hour is come, now glorifie thy Son:</hi> now ſhew mercy to thy Church; now execute thy wrath upon the perſecutors and oppreſſors of the Church: No, he muſt do it preſently, whether his time be come, or no: they have not ſo much patience and humility to wait upon him, and leave him to his own time: they cannot tarry for him one hour. This was the Miſtake of <hi>Mary;</hi> ſhe would needs direct our Saviour when to work his Miracles, before his hour, or time was come. <hi>John</hi> 2.4. And we poor Creatures are ſo ſawcy, and ſo bold ſometimes, to tell the Lord when he muſt ſhew us ſuch a favour, when he muſt give us ſuch a mercy: if he delay, and if he linger beyond the time that we appoint him, we are gone, we cannot wait upon him any
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:46169:32"/>
longer: We ſend for his aſſiſtance, as it were by Poſt, and preſcribe the Lord a day, as the Bethulians. And ſo upon the other ſide we appoint him when to deal againſt the enemies and perſecutors of his people. We ſet him down a time, and we order him a ſeaſon to wreake his vengeance, and his wrath upon them. But what ſaith God? to me belongeth vengeance and recompence. This is a buſineſs that belongs to me, it appertaineth not to you to meddle with it. Their feet ſhall ſlide in due time; for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that ſhall come upon them make haſte. We are ſo earneſt many times, that we would have him ſtrike them preſently, and tread down all his enemies that riſe againſt him, and his cauſe and people; and take an order with them out of hand; But God is of another mind, he deſigns another time, and we do very ill to go about to turn him from it.</p>
                  <p>It is a bold intruſion on the property of God, on that which appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and belongeth to him in the fore-alledged text. A ſnatching of the times and ſeaſons out of his hands. And it is a high preſumption; for while we carry matters thus, we do at leaſt imply that we are wiſer then the Lord, that we can chooſe out fitter ſeaſons for the accompliſhment of his deſigns then he doth; which is a Blaſphemy to be abhorred and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at by every Chriſtian.</p>

And let us freely leave him to his own time. If the prefixed and the conſtituted time be manifeſt and revealed to us, as to our Saviour in my Text, then let us pray as he, the hour is come.

And this becauſe in many caſes it may ſeem to linger, and we may be apt to faint, I ſhall briefly ſet before you two or three Conſiderations, to uphold your hearts till your fathers hour comes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conſider that the Father waites for the good hour as well as you. Do you wait to receive mercy? He waites to ſhew mercy. Do you wait that he may be gracious? He waiteth that he may be gracious too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.18. Why are you ſo impatient then? Why ſhould not you be well content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pleaſed to wait as well as he? Shall all the waiting be on his ſide, none of yours? ſee if this be good reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Conſider that till the Fathers hour of mercy come, he is preparing you for mercy, and preparing mercy for you. He is not ſlack, as men count ſlackneſs, he haſtens ſuch a work of mercy as he ſeemeth to defer. Many times the work is great, and there are many wheels that turn in it, and they muſt move about in time; too quick a motion would diſorder all. The Lord hath many things to bring about in ſuch a buſineſs, and therefore he goes onward with it ſlowly, by degrees, and ſo at length he brings it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; He means to make a goodly ſtructure, and therefore he is lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:46169:32"/>
the foundation deep and low, that he may raiſe the frame of mercy and ſalvation which he means to build upon it high and firm, that it may never be removed again.</p>
                  <p>Let us conſider if the hour of mercy linger, that the fault is in our ſelves.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Alas, God labours hard about us, but we are knotty peices, we will not ſuddenly be brought to any frame. We are not qualified for a cure and extraordinary mercy by and by. Oh what a task God hath to humble us, to make us ſenſible of undeſervingneſs, to qualifie us ſo, that we may prize the mercy, and uſe the mercy as we ought to do; So the while he is moulding us, and fitting us, he may complain of us, as once he did of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> Will you never be made fit? when will it once be? We have ſuch ſtrong Corruptions in us that they will not be ſubdued: we have ſuch proud and ſtubborn hearts that they will not be brought down; So that if God be long about us, and if he keep us under hand, we have cauſe to thank our ſelves and the perverſneſs of our own hearts.</p>
                  <p>Let us conſider that the fathers hour will come, in which he will ſhew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> us mercy. He will ariſe and have mercy on <hi>Sion.</hi> The needy ſhall not alwayes be forgotten, nor the expectation of the poor fail for ever, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.18. Though he hide himſelf, yet he will be a Saviour notwithſtanding; And therefore this let us depend and ſettle on, let us keep our hearts to this, with the poor afflicted Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. Loe, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us; we will be glad in his ſalvation. You ſee how confident ſhe is, ſhe ſtands not upon Ifs and Ands. It is not peradventure, or it may be, or the like, but he will ſave us, and we will be glad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The more the fathers hour lingers, the greater mercy it will bring with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it: the more will it abound with multiplyed overflowing comfort, when it comes. Gods manner is to meaſure and proportion comforts to afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to cheriſh and revive his people according to the daies in which he hath afflicted them, and according to the times in which their ſouls have ſeen ſorrow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.15. That Proclamation is remarkeable, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1. Comfort. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> comfort ye my people. It is repeated twice you ſee And why ſo? The reaſon is annexed, ſhe hath received at the Lords hand double for her ſins, ſhe hath had double ſorrow, and therefore now ſhe ſhall have double comfort.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the riſe of that part of our Saviours prayer which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns himſelf, the ground on which he takes occaſion to preſent it to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>The hour is come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Proceed we to the matter of it, or the things which he deſireth of the Father; and this is that he may be glorified. <hi>Father glorifie thy Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no difficulty conſiderable in the words. To glorifie is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make glorious. But uſually and in the ordinary acceptation of the Scripture, to Render glorious in the eyes of others, whether it be thing or perſon. And this is Evident by that which Chriſt deſireth of his Father, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this expreſſion. He had abaſed himſelf you know, and made himſelf of no reputation, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. and now he prayes the Father, that he would advance him, and honour him again, that he would ſhew him forth in Luſtre and in Splendour to the world. And that

becauſe the time of his abaſure and humiliation was now drawing to an end, and the time of his advancement and exaltation was at hand, <hi>Father the hour is come, Glorifie thy Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this petition of our Saviour intimates at leaſt the Fathers purpoſe to glorifie his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he was reſolved upon it, and the hour in which to do it: both upon the thing, and time. The hour is come in which thou haſt decreed to glorifie me, and therefore I beſeech thee Father, do it now, fullfill thy reſolution and intention. <hi>The hour is come, glorifie thy Son.</hi> So that the point apparently ſuggeſted here is this.</p>

                  <p>The Fathers reſolution appeareth in the Sons Petition. For that which Chriſts deſires, the Father wills.

And therefore he himſelf hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Chriſt exceedingly, as you may ſee in the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, almoſt from the beginning to the end.

                  <p>Now this deſign and purpoſe of the Father to glorifie his Son Chriſt, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth evidently divers wayes, which I ſhall briefly ſet before you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It appeareth by the honourable titles that he gives him, that he hath a mind to dignifie him, and to ſet him up. Sometimes he calls him Prince, and great Prince, <hi>Michael</hi> the great Prince, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. Sometimes King, his King, Yet have I ſet my King ſaith God the Father, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. You ſee this is the name he gives him, and it is written on his thigh and on his veſture, that he that runs may read it, <hi>Apocalypſ.</hi> 19.16. King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. Sometimes he calls him God, as you may ſee in the forealledged place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8. Unto the Son he ſaith, (the Father ſaith,) Thy throne, Oh God, is for ever and ever. And ſometimes Lord, not <hi>Elohim,</hi> or <hi>Adonai,</hi> which name is frequenlty applied to men, but Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which name is proper and peculiar to the Living God only, and which he ſeriouſly profeſſeth that he will not give to any other, and yet
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:46169:33"/>
this name he gives to Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. And he would have us call him by it too this is the name whereby he ſhall be called, <hi>Jehovah</hi> (ſo is the expreſſion there) the Lord our righteouſneſs. So that no marvail that the Apoſtle tels us that he honoured him in this reſpect exceedingly, tranſcendently; he hath highly exalted him. How ſo? <hi>And given him a name above every name, that at the name of Ieſus every knee ſhould bow.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Counſel of the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 45.11. <hi>He is thy Lord, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip thou him.</hi> And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith, he is made ſo much better then the Angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name then they.</p>
                  <p>It appears that God hath a deſign to honour Chriſt, as by the names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he gives to Chriſt, ſo by the names which he himſelf aſſumes in reference to Chriſt: as he delights to call himſelf the Lord of Chriſt, and the Father of Chriſt, and the Maſter of Chriſt, as being taken very much that he hath ſuch a Son, and ſuch a ſervant: for ſo he ſeemeth to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> Mat. 3.17. take notice of him, this is he: So in another place, <hi>Behold my Servant,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. There look upon him, and obſerve him well, and ſee if any of you have ſuch a ſervant as I have. In the Old Teſtament the Lord was wont to call himſelf the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob;</hi> he was honoured by thoſe names, the Lord their God that brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But now in the New Teſtament, he cals himſelf the God and Father of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. I might give you many more; the God that brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Thus ſtriving to exalt him, and to ſet him up, that the eyes and thoughts of men might be taken up with him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It appears, &amp;c. By the place in which he ſets him, and that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> at his own right hand. It is obſerved in <hi>Solomon,</hi> by the holy Ghoſt himſelf, as a great honour which he did his Mother, 1 Kings 2.19. <hi>He ſate down on his throne, and cauſed a ſeat to be ſet for the Kings Mother, and ſhe ſate on his right hand.</hi> This honour God hath done Chriſt, as the Apoſtle tels us, Eph. 1.20. <hi>He raiſed him from the dead,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and ſet him at his own right hand, in heavenly places.</hi> That is, he ſet him above all other things or perſons, in the next place to himſelf: And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>he ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalties, and powers, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but in that which is to come:</hi> this is very great honour.</p>
                  <p>It appears that God hath a deſign to honour Chriſt by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that he hath endowed him with, and that is his own authority, yea, all his own authority, as Chriſt himſelf acknowledges, Mat. 28.18. <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth:</hi> not ſome, but all power: <hi>The father judgeth no man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment to the Son,</hi> John 5.22. He hath done in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as great men ſometimes uſe to do: if they have any title, office, or place of honour, they are contented to convey it over to their eldeſt Son, that they may credit him, and raiſe him to eſteem and reputation in his Country: and it delighteth them as much to have him honoured as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46169:34"/>
Juſt ſo hath God the Father done by Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son.</hi> He will be Iudge no longer by immediate execution, but he hath made his Son the Judge of all the world; And why ſo? that he may compaſs the deſign of his, for glorifying of his Son Chriſt, <hi>That all men ſhould honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> as it is added in the next verſe. And as he hath (in the ſenſe that we have ſaid) reſigned up his judiciary power abroad to Ieſus Chriſt, ſo the private Government of his family at home. He hath made his eldeſt Son the Lord of all, he hath ſet him over his houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6. The Son of God hath got a match, though a poor one, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and now the Father gives up the houſe-keeping wholly to him. And hence ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 3.14, 15. <hi>I bow my knees unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> The whole family of heaven and earth is named from Chriſt, whether the upper family of heaven, or the lower family on earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church triumphant or the Church militant, it is Chriſts family and Chriſts Church, and Chriſts houſhold. God you ſee, hath two houſes, and yet he doth not govern one himſelf, and leave the other to his Son, he commits the government of both to Jeſus Chriſt; that he may be all in all, that he may be the more honoured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It appears that God hath a deſign to glorifie his Son Chriſt, by the great offices of dignity, and truſt, and honour which he hath advanced and raiſed him to: For he hath crowned him with glory and honour. Three offices there are which have been alwayes looked upon as full of honour: The office of a King, of a Prieſt, and of a Prophet. Of a King in the Commonwealth, and of a Ptieſt, and Prophet in the Church. And all of them concurr in Jeſus Chriſt; he is annointed to them altogether. And this is ſingular to Jeſus Chriſt, it is peculiar to himſelf alone, no other man was ever thus advanced beſides himſelf. Some other men have had one of theſe offices, or two at moſt, but never any man had all three, but Chriſt only: So that he is in this reſpect; tranſcendently advanced you ſee, and God hath glorified him beyond meaſure, and beyond pattern.</p>
                  <p>And that you may the better ſee the honour that is done to Ieſus Chriſt, in that he hath theſe three great Offices altogether in his hands: I ſhall repreſent it to you in a few Particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, By this means whatſoever good is purchaſed for the Church, is procured by him only; The Father, that he may advance, and honour Chriſt the more, will have the Church beholding unto none but him for any good that ſhe enjoys or looks for. He muſt purchaſe peace, and he muſt purchaſe grace for her: the grace of righteouſneſs, and the grace of holineſs: he muſt ſatisfie, &amp; he muſt ſanctifie: he muſt obtain her abſolution, and he muſt obtain her ſanctification, and he muſt obtain her glorification: he muſt renew her right in outward things which ſhe forfeited in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he muſt do all this alone, there muſt be none beſides him, none with him. No, he muſt tread the wine-preſs of his Fathers wrath alone. By once offering of himſelf, he muſt perfect for ever them that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified. The Lord hath given us no other King to ſubdue our enemies, and to get peace for us; No other Prieſt to ſatisfie his wrath, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:46169:34"/>
Grace for us. No other Mediator between God and man either of Redemption, or Interceſſion; either of Redemption to purchaſe grace, or of Interceſſion to ſue out that which he hath purchaſed; All lies on Jeſus Chriſt, you ſee, that he may be all in all, that all the glory may redound to him.</p>
                  <p>As whatſoever good is purchaſed for the Church is procured by him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> only, ſo it is revealed by him only. As he, and he alone muſt get it ſo he, and he alone muſt tell us of it. It is an honour to be ſent with good news, and God hath done his Son this honour; The Goſpel, as you know, is glad tydings of great Joy, and Chriſt is he that makes it known to men. He brings it forth out of the boſome of the Father. And therefore it is called the word of Chriſt Not only becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is the author and the Subject matter of it, but the revealer of it too. God in theſe latter daies hath ſpoken to us by his Son, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the revelation of the Goſpel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. He had good news to tell the world, and he ſent his Son with it. He ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> with the Law, which was a Meſſage full of terrour; <hi>Moſes</hi> was good enough for that. The Goſpel was a Meſſage full of ſweetneſs and full of Comfort, and Chriſt muſt have the honour to reveal that to the world. Indeed my brethren whatſoever good we know of God, or of his favour and good will towards us, or of the work of our redemption, and reconciliation, and attonement, all comes out by Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt is the only Prophet of the Church; and if we ask the queſtion which the Pſalmiſt mentions, Pſal. 4.6. <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, None but Ieſus Chriſt can do it, or thoſe that are ſent out by him with his Meſſage, and in his Name.</p>
                  <p>As whatſoever good is purchaſed for the Church is procured by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt only, and revealed by Chriſt only, ſo it is diſpenſed by Chriſt only. God doth not give it out immediately himſelf, but he communicates it to us, in, and by, and through Chriſt, as the Expreſſion of the Scripture is, <hi>The grace of God is ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Titus 3.6. As all comes by his means, ſo all goes through his hands. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to have received gifts for men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 68.18. God doth not give his gifts directly, and immediately to men himſelf, but Jeſus Chriſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their endowments for them of the Father, that of his fulneſs they may all receive. He is the Treaſurer of his Fathers grace, that every one may come to him. God hath exalted him to be a Prince to his People, and ſo to give them as a King (as once <hi>Araunah</hi> ſaid to <hi>David</hi>) in a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and Royal way. And this he hath done to advance him and to make him glorious, that as all comes from him, ſo all may be aſcribed to him.</p>
                  <p>It appears that God hath a deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as by the offices in which he puts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> him, ſo by the gifts, and the abilities which he endues him with for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of thoſe places. To put a perſon in an office, who is not quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and fitted for it, who is not able to diſcharge it, is to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and make him deſpicable in the eyes of others. God doth not ſo with Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore as he makes him King, and Prieſt, and Prophet, ſo he enables him to the performance and execution of theſe offices. As he appoints him to them, ſo he annoints
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:46169:35"/>
h m with gifts, and graces, and abilities, that he may go through with them with credit, as we uſe to ſay, both to the honour of his Father and himſelf. He is the head of the body the Church (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.17. And to this end <hi>it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> dwell,</hi> as it is added there in that place.</p>
                  <p>It appears that God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that he makes the fulneſs of the God-head dwell in him; Others are Partakers of the divine nature but he is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the Divine Eſſence. Others are Partakers of the properties of God, but he is partaker of the God-head it ſelf. Others are partakers of the grace of God, but he is partaker of the God of grace. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith not, that in Chriſt dwelleth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> that is the Deity. In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God-head bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Not that the Godhead is confined, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed within the narrow limits of our Saviours fleſh, or that his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is co-extended with the God-head, as Ubiquitaries dream. But the God-head dwells in Chriſt, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, not <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrative,</hi> not by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns and ſhadows, and tokens of his preſence, as once he dwelt in the material Temple; not <hi>effective,</hi> by the powerfull operation of it, not only by the Graces of it, as it dwelleth in the bodies of his Saints, who therefore are called the Temples of God; But in him dwells the God-head bodily, that is, it is really united to the humane nature, to the body of Jeſus Chriſt, And herein Chriſt hath no Peer. It is a high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchable honour, which no other Creature is capable of, by which he is advanced above all other things and perſons in the world beſides.</p>

               <p>A great part of our Saviours paſſion (my beloved conſiſted in the great diſhonour that was done to him, and in the ſcorn, and the deriſion, and the contemptuous uſage which he ſuffered, even from the vileſt, and the worſt of men. If you ſurvey it in the Goſpel ſtorie, and lay it altogether, all the affronts, and jears, and taunts, and uncivil imputations that were put upon him, you will admire that the glorious Son of God ſhould ever ſtoop ſo low for our ſakes: yet this he did for the accompliſhment of that great work, to which he was appointed by the Father: And therefore God in recompence hath ſet him up again, and raiſed him to the height of digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory.</p>
               <p>And that he did it on this very ground, we learn from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. and following verſes. <hi>He made himſelf</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf;</hi> And what of this? why therefore God hath highly exalted him, exalted him, and exalted him highly, as it is added in the next words, therefore becauſe he was abaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:46169:35"/>And hence our Saviour uſeth this as an enforcing argument when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to be glorified by his father, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe he had been formely diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and brought low. For this is cleerly intimated in the words, <hi>John</hi> 17.4, 5. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, and now, O Father, glorifie me with thy ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The works of Chriſt were ſome of Miniſtry and ſervice, and abaſure in the office of obedience and ſuffering for the Church; and ſome of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and majeſty, in the protection and exaltation of the Church; and thoſe were to foregoe theſe. He ought to ſuffer and ſo enter into glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26. There was a <hi>neceſſe</hi> in it, a neceſſity of Gods decree who had appointed, and deſigned it to be ſo, of Gods juſtice which muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by obedience, before he would be pacified with men, or in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their head and advocate advance them to his glory. Of Gods word in the prediction of the Prophets, who had fore-ſhewed, and prophecied that it muſt be ſo. And hence ſaith Chriſt in the fore-cited text, <hi>I have finiſhed my work,</hi> the work of my humiliation, and therefore now I pray thee glorifie me with thy ſelf. Let my exaltation follow. I ſhould not look to be exalted if I had not firſt been humbled. But ſeeing I have done the ſervice, let me have the recompence: ſince I have undergone the one, let me be raiſed to the other.</p>
               <p>It hath been the deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he himſelf might be glorified by it.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>2</label> His utmoſt aim is that he may be honoured in the honour of his Son.</p>
               <p>Brethren, the Lord in all his works (I ſpeak it reverently) is a ſelf-ſeeker, he ſeeks himſelf in every thing he doth, and it is very fit he ſhould, becauſe there is no end above himſelf, nor better then himſelf. And if we had no higher end (my brethren) then our ſelves, we might ſeek our ſelves too. In all his actions, he hath an eye upon his own glory. And ſo he hath in this which we are ſpeaking of, the exaltation, and advancement of his Son. And therefore with this Argument our Saviour urgeth this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why ſhould I glorifie thee (might the father ſay) what ſhall I get by it? Thou ſhalt get honour by it (ſaith our Saviour) and therefore I beſeech thee to glorifie me upon this account; <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee.</hi> I cannot glorifie thee much in this abaſure, and contempt; but if thou glorifie me once, it ſhall come back again upon thee by reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will be ſure to honour thee again; And therefore I beſeech thee do it for thy own ſake, and in relation to thy own glory.</p>
               <p>Now is it ſo, my brethren, that it hath been the deſign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then certainly <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> it is a bold adventurous part for any man to diſhonour Jeſus Chriſt, and to caſt contempt upon him: Whoever doth it, runs a very great hazard. He doth what lies in him to croſs the Lord in that which he is moſt intent upon, on which his heart is wonderfully ſet.</p>
               <p>Great men cannot endure (you know) to be croſſed in their wills, or hindered of their purpoſes; and how think you, will the great God endure to be affronted, and oppoſed, and croſſed in ſuch a thing as this is? From all Eternity he hath determined with himſelf to glorifie his Son Chriſt, he hath had it in his heart from everlaſting, he hath reſolved he ſhall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured; and that not by men alone, but by the very Angels too, thoſe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:46169:36"/>
eminent and glorious Creatures. It is the Fathers pleaſure that it ſhall be ſo, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. When he bringeth in his firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten into the world, he ſaith, and let all the Angels of God worſhip him. Not ſerve him, and obey him only, but worſhip him with divine, and with religious adoration, which is the heigth and top of honour, with the ſame honour that belongeth to the Father, as Chriſt himſelf expreſſeth it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.23. And if he muſt have honour, ſuch tranſcendent honour from the very Angels, muſt he not have it from inferiour creatures, who are far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Angels? Yes, Gods expects it, that at the name (that is) the power and authority of Jeſus, every knee ſhould bow, not of things in heaven only, but of things in earth too, that is, not of Angels only but of men. So that you ſee the father looks for this at our hands, he looks we ſhould do honour to his Son.</p>
               <p>He ſaith as in the Parable, They will reverence my Son. Though they have ſlighted and abuſed other meſſengers that I have ſent among them, yet they will ſurely reverence my Son. It is impoſſible they ſhould be ſo unworthy to contemn my own Son. And what then do we think of thoſe who diſhonour and contemn him notwithſtanding? will the father who hath ſent him to this End, that he might be honoured, take this well at their hands, to be thus croſſed in ſuch a great deſign of his by wretched men? To ſee his own begotten Son deſpiſed, and ſcorned, whom he hath done ſo much to honour? Why, you will ſay, what need you be ſo earneſt upon this particular? Who doth diſhonour Jeſus Chriſt? Who doth deſpiſe him, or contemn him? do we not all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be our Lord and Saviour, and the like? yes we do all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him in words, indeed we call him Lord. But many of us buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him, and ſpit upon him in the very ſame breath. There are abundance of us (my beloved) who in name are Chriſtians, who do exceedingly diſhonour Jeſus Chriſt, whatever their pretences and proteſtations be, and I will ſhew you briefly who they are.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> All unbelievers do diſhonour Chriſt exceedingly in this reſpect, that they do not cloſe with him; That when he is propoſed and offered to them in the Goſpel, they do not take him, and receive him on the terms that he is offered, but put him off with a denial. This is a great diſhonour to the Lord Chriſt. It is no leſs then an implicite ſcorning and deſpiſing of him. As if he were ſo poor a gift that he were not worth the taking. Ah, my beloved, do but think upon it, that after Chriſt hath undergone ſo much as he hath done for our ſalvation, and after comes a begging to our own doors, beſeeching us that we will entertain him, and receive him, and accept of him, and that not for his own advantage or profit that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crews to him, but meerly for our own good; That he ſhould ſtoop ſo low, even by entreaties to impoſe himſelf upon us, and we ſhould be inexorable to him, and baſely thruſt him quite away from us, and refuſe to meddle with him. Oh what a horrible indignity is this to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt? What an unſpeakable debaſing of him? Yet thus all unbelievers uſe him. All, I mean where Chriſt is preached.

               <p>They that deſpiſe and ſlight the blood of Chriſt, they diſhonour Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> himſelf. His blood you cannot chuſe but think is dear to him, and the contemptuous uſage of it reflects with high diſparagement upon him. But you will ſay who de piſes Chriſts blood? are any ſo unworthy and ſo baſe among us? yes there are ſome ſuch among us who uſe the blood of Chriſt as if they did account it an unholy thing, as if it were but common blood, the blood of any ordinary creature which they might freely undervalue at their pleaſure; And ſo in doing this, they tread underfoot the ſon of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. they throw him down, and tread him under foot, as if he were but duſt, or dung, or ſome ſuch baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thing, which is the horribleſt contempt that can be. They tread under foot the Son of God, while they account his blood an unholy thing.</p>
               <p>But who accounts it ſo you will demand? Why they that uſe it ſo, do in effect account it ſo, and truly there are multitudes of ſuch among us. When ordinary blood is ſhed, as the blood of any beaſts, you know, we make no reckoning of it, we look not after it, we ſpend not any thought upon it, it is ſhed and there's an end. And verily my brethren, there are many who make no more of the blood of Chriſt himſelf, then if it were but common blood, then if an Ox, or any other beaſt were ſlain, and ſo account it an unholy thing. They never think upon it, unleſs it be to ſwear by it, they never meditate upon the end for which he ſhed it, or the uſe which they ought to make of it. He ſhed his blood for us (ſaith the Apoſtle) that we ſhould live no longer to our ſelves but to him that died for us. And yet how many are there who live wholly to themſelves notwithſtanding all this, who ſeek themſelves, their own ends, their own things, and not the things of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>He loved his Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. that he might waſh it in his own blood. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.5. And yet what multitudes are here among us, who are not cleanſed, or waſhed to this day, but tumble in the Kennel ſtill, wherein the ſwine of this world wallow? and ſo they make the Son of God, as much as in them lies, to ſuffer and to die in vain, they ſpill his precious blood upon the ground, as if it were of no value: Chriſt ſhed his blood to this end that his people might be holy, and they will be impure ſtill, and wallow in their luſts ſtill. They care not what become of it, let it be ſhed in vain for them, they reckon not. Oh what a high contempt is this to Jeſus Chriſt! Theſe men as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, tread underfoot the Son of God, they tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on him in Diſdain; and put him to the greateſt ſhame that can be.</p>
               <p>They that deſpiſe and ſlight the ſpirit of Chriſt, diſhonour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

the Comforter the holy Spirit is the meſſenger of Chriſt, he is inſtead of Chriſt to his people, he repreſents him abſent to the ſoul. And therefore he is ſaid in Scripture to be with them, in that his holy Spirit is with them. Behold I am with you alwayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by my Spirit to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>ult.</hi> I will not leave you comfortleſs ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciple, I will come to you, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.18. he meaneth not by himſelf, but by his Spirit. So that when the Spirit comes, Chriſt comes; and therefore it is added preſently, At that time you ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. So that if this ſweet Meſſenger of Jeſus Chriſt, who is to us inſtead of Chriſt, be ill-entreated by us, it is apparently a very great indignity to Chriſt himſelf. And yet how often do we damp the holy motions of this Spirit in our hearts? When good deſires and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes are raiſed and kindled there, how often do we ſmother them and put them out again? how frequently do we miſuſe him, who comes with counſel, and with comfort, and with grace, from ſuch a choiſe and pretious friend as Chriſt is? How do we ſlight the ſeaſonable caveats that the ſpirit gives us, either for our information, or elſe for our conſolation, and what is this upon the matter, but to deſpiſe and ſlight Chriſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> They that deſpiſe and ſlight the Meſſengers and the Embaſſadors of Chriſt, they diſhonour Chriſt himſelf. He is in this reſpect at the ſame hand that Princes are, the wrongs and the indignities that are done to thoſe they ſend, they take as offered to themſelves; and truly ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt. His Miniſters, the Preachers, and Diſpenſers of his Goſpel, are his Embaſſadors to men, they are inſtead of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. Now then we are Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors for Chriſt, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead; and they that injure or diſhonour thoſe that are for Chriſt, and that are in Chriſts ſtead, muſt needs diſhonour Chriſt himſelf. Our Saviour is expreſs and plain for this to his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16. He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that ſent me. <hi>q. d.</hi> My Father ſent me, and therefore he that deſpiſeth, me deſpiſeth him. And I ſend you, and therefore he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me: I ſhall ſay little of this Argument, for fear of miſconſtruction, I ſhall but leave it to your ſelves to judge whether Chriſt be in this reſpect deſpiſed and diſhonoured, yea, or no. Whether he be abuſed in thoſe whom he hath ſent, whoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours he hath bleſſed, and to whom he hath given the ſeals of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, I hope they will not much complain to any, but to Chriſt that ſent them, and if he be reſolved to bear it, I make no queſtion he will give them grace and ſtrength to bear it too, and to profit much by it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> They that fall away from Chriſt after ſome acquaintance with him, they diſhonour and diſgrace him. For in deſerting him, they ſeem to tell the world that there is nothing in him why we ſhould deſire him. They have tried him, and they find him by experience to be ſuch a one as is not worth the keeping any longer. And therefore the Apoſtle, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Apoſtates, ſaith that they put Chriſt to open ſhame, for that is his expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. if they fall away, ſaith he, they crucifie the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame. A ſervant looks
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:46169:37"/>
upon it as a ſhame and a diſparagement if he be put away: So if a Servant leave his Maſter (if the reaſon be not known) it is ſome diſgrace to him. Men are very apt to think that he is a hard Maſter, that he is faulty in ſome kind or other, and that he deals not well with thoſe that ſerve him. And ſo when men forſake the ſervice of the Lord Chriſt, they make the world believe that he is an ill Maſter, that there is better wages, and more content and ſatisfaction to be had in the ſervice of ſin then the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt; And is not this a great diſhonour to him? And yet how many are there in theſe latter times, who bring diſparagement to Jeſus Chriſt by this means, and make his ſervice deſpicable in the eyes of others? How many have withdrawn from Jeſus Chriſt of late, given over waiting on his holy Ordinances, and left performing of thoſe duties to him which they were wont exactly, and conſtantly, and duly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. They talk of Chriſtian Liberty, and this they take to be from the ſervice of Chriſt, whereas it is indeed from the ſervice of ſin: And ſo they are more looſe, and careleſs, and remiſs, and negligent then they have been in former times. Theſe men diſgrace Chriſt, whom God hath ſet himſelf to honour, and ſo they croſs him in his great deſign.</p>
               <p>Now, I beſeech you, think upon it, you that diſhonour Chriſt, in any of the ways forementioned, or in any other way, let it be what it will: Remember that it is the purpoſe and deſign of God to glorifie his Son Chriſt; and what then will become of you, who thwart with him, who ſeek as much as lies in you to hinder him from execution of that which he is ſo intent upon? Will he take it at your hands? Nay, if he ſend his Son among you, and ſay, as in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.13. <hi>They will reverence my Son,</hi> and you upon the other ſide, neglect him and contemn him, and abaſe him every way, he will be out of patience with you, to be thus croſſed by wretched men; he will certainly deſtroy you, he will make you know the price of ſlighting and deſpiſing him, whoſe honour is as dear and tender to him as his own.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that it hath been the deſign, &amp;c? Then be we all exhorted to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> comply with God, in this great deſign of his, and to promote it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power. Let us endeavour every way to help him in that which he is ſo intent upon, the glorifying of his Son Chriſt. Its true, God needs not any of our help, he can do his own work, and bring his own deſign and purpoſes to paſs without us; he can glorifie his Son, whether we poor ſimple Creatures will or no: but yet in any caſe wherein we may be inſtrumental to him, wherein we may be uſefull any way to further that which he intendeth, he expects that we ſhould come to the help of the Lord, as the expreſſion is, though in another caſe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.23. and therefore let us ſeriouſly conſider what our duty is, and let us ſet up Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and glorifie him to the utmoſt of our power.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall propound two things, which I ſhall orderly purſue; Firſt, let us advance his glory, when it is without our own: and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us advance his glory, when it is againſt our own.</p>
               <p>Let us ſet up his glory when it is without our own, when we have no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> glory by it, when we have no glory with it. There be many in the World, that ſeem to glorifie the Lord Chriſt, when his glory and their own concur, and come together in a Line: When Chriſt, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:46169:38"/>
they may be ſet up together, when they advance and raiſe themſelves in raiſing and advancing him, they are very well content. As this was Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hues caſe, you know, his intereſt and Gods did meet, in rooting out the Line of <hi>Ahab,</hi> ſo that he ſeemed to be zealous for the Lord of Hoſts, when he was zealous only for himſelf, and for the greatneſs and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his own houſe. But when the glory of the Lord comes ſingle, and alone, and naked to them, ſo that they have nothing to quicken and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to ſuch a work, to ſuch a duty, but his honour only; as for their own part, they are like to get diſparagement among the greater part of men, and to be diſgraced by it, they will not ſtir, they will do nothing in ſuch a caſe as this is. A Magiſtrate it may be will be very earneſt in taking courſe with thoſe exorbitancies and abuſes which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Chriſt, as long as he himſelf may attain to honour by it, and be applauded every where for his integrity, and zeal, and courage, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs. But when he meets with ſcoffs and taunts on every ſide, when he comes to be affronted and diſgraced, and blaſted for his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to be looked upon as a pragmatical, and buſie man, he thinks it better to give over and be quiet. A Miniſter, it may be, will be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in his Calling, very diligent in Preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, while he may be commended and admired; but when he miſſes his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected honour and applauſe, he is like a becalmed Ship at Sea, and ſtirs no longer then the breath of people drives him. And ſo a private perſon, it may be, will be very holy and preciſe, very conſtant, and very diligent in duty, very exact in waiting on the Ordinances, and the like, as long as thoſe things gain him reputation and eſteem with thoſe to whom he would approve himſelf. But when they come once to be looked upon as matter of diſparagement, and when he is diſgraced for them, he hath done with theſe courſes.</p>
               <p>Theſe men do glorifie themſelves, and not Chriſt, at leaſt they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him with relation to themſelves, and make his glory but a means to the attainment of their own; ſo that their utmoſt end is really their own glory; ſo that however it may ſeem, they do not truly joyn with God in the accompliſhment of this deſign of his, touching the glorifying of his Son Chriſt. Now, I beſeech you, my Beloved, let us not be like theſe men, let us advance the Son of God ſingle, let us ſet up his glory when it is without our own.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Nay, to go further yet, let us ſet up his glory where it is againſt our own, which is the ſecond thing propoſed; when we are no gainers by it, but rather loſers in our own honour. And thus the Saints of God have done, as I ſhall give you divers inſtances out of the Scripture, becauſe the thing is difficult, and will need the more enforcing. <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was much cryed up among the people, as if he had been the Meſſias: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, if they had been in his place, would have nouriſhed theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and taken to themſelves thoſe fooliſh attributions: But he is ſo far from this, that he endeavors every way to put them off from him, <hi>There comes one after me, who is mightier then I, the latchet of whoſe ſhoo I am not worthy to ſtoop down and unlooſe,</hi> Mar. 1.8, 9. <hi>I indeed have baptized you with water, but he ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt. q.d.</hi> You queſtion whether I be Chriſt or no, and thus you magnifie me, and applaud me, and attribute
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:46169:38"/>
that to me which indeed belongs to Chriſt. But I muſt tell you plainly, I am not the Chriſt (as in another place he doth) I am no body to him, I am not worthy to unty his ſhoes, to do the meaneſt Office that belongs to him: And for the Miniſtry, my Art is outward, and not to be compared with his, <hi>I indeed baptize,</hi> &amp;c. And in another place he ſhews the very ſame temper, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.30 <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe. q.d.</hi> It muſt be ſo, and I am very well content, ſo he increaſe, and ſo his glory grow, I care not though I wane and wither in my honour, and in the reputation and eſteem which I have among the people.</p>
               <p>So the Apoſtles, when the people aſcribed the Miracle which they had done to them, how did they ſhake away this honour from them? <hi>Acts</hi> 3.12. <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, why look you ſo earneſtly on us, as if by our own power or holineſs, we had made this man whole:</hi> no, God hath done it to glorifie his Son Chriſt, in proſecution of this great deſign, as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there in that place.</p>
               <p>And when was <hi>Paul</hi> in ſuch a heat, as when the people took <hi>Barnabas</hi> and him for gods, and would have offered ſacrifice unto them? <hi>Act.</hi> 14.13. <hi>When they heard what was done, they rent their cloaths, and ran in among the people, crying out, and ſaying, Sirs, why do ye theſe things? you think us to be Gods, but we are men of like paſsions with your ſelves, and preach unto you that you ſhould turn from theſe vanities, unto the living God.</hi> You ſee they labour to advance the Lord, by taking off thoſe high conceits which the people had of them.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you my beloved, let the ſame minde be in us that was in theſe men. Let us not regard a jot what becomes of our honour, ſo the deſign of our God go forward touching the glorifying of his Son. And let us ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> in another place, <hi>So Chriſt be glorified, we have enough.</hi> You that are in any office, do not conſider with your ſelves how you may carry matters, ſo that you may be commended and approved, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and meek, and quiet men; but how you may extirpate ſin, which diſhonours Jeſus Chriſt, and root out evil doers from the City of the Lord: and if you be abuſed for this, if looſe contentious people tax you, and run out upon you; if Drunkards in their Ale make Songs upon you, do you deſpiſe the ſhame as Chriſt did, ſo you may bring him any glory?</p>
               <p>So we that are the Miniſters of Chriſt, let this be our endeavour to advance and ſet up Chriſt; let us ſtudy ſuch a way, and follow ſuch a courſe as will glorifie him moſt, though it redound not to our own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Let us not make this our aim, how we may carry matters, ſo that we may be admired and magnified, that we may be accounted eloquent and learned, and the like; but that the people may be edified, and that they may be won to Jeſus Chriſt: That way of preaching, be it what it will, which ſerveth beſt to theſe ends, let us endeavour after, yea and though it ſhould be prejudicial to our own glory, though it ſhould eclipſe us. What ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>I preach not my ſelf, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not my intention to ſet up my ſelf, that I may be looked upon, that my abilities may be applauded and admired; no, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not though I be concealed, though I be hid among the croud, ſo as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:46169:39"/>
Jeſus Chriſt appear, ſo as the affections and thoughts of men be ſet on him, ſo he be repreſented to the people in his glory: <hi>I preach not my ſelf, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and my ſelf your ſervant for Jeſus his ſake. And ſo for private Chriſtians, let us ſeriouſly conſider what the Lord expects from us, and how intent he is on this buſineſs, and let us ſtrive to ſerve him, and be inſtrumental to him in this great deſign of his. Let us make this our work and buſineſs, how we may glorifie the Lord Chriſt, become what will of our eſteem and reputation in the world. And this, becauſe it is a hard leſſon, I ſhall excite you to the learning and the practiſing of it, with a few motives.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conſider wherefore you were made and placed in the world; what, to ſet up your ſelves, and to advance your own honour? No, but to glorifie the Lord Chriſt; this was the end of your Creation; <hi>All things were created by him, and for him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. As they were created by him, ſo they were created for him. Now a thing may be made either for the need and conveniency, or elſe for the honour and glory of him for whom it is made. As great men in their houſes, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wont to have ſome things for uſe, and others for pomp. Now Jeſus Chriſt made nothing in the world for need; he needs not us for any thing that we can do; for he was abſolutely full and perfect, and compleat, before we had a being in the world; or had it not been ſo, undoubtedly he would have made us ſooner, he would not have remained ſo long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. So then he made us for his glory, that was the end he aimed at in our Creation: And therefore it concerneth us to ſee that we anſwer this end, and that we glorifie the Lord Chriſt: Or if we do not ſo; firſt, our ſin is very great, we ſin againſt the great, the utmoſt end of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And ſecondly, our danger is very great, and we are in extreameſt peril of deſtruction. Any thing that is unuſefull, or unſerviceable to the end that it was made, is fit for nothing elſe but ruine. We make a fire to warm us, and to dreſs our meat, but if it fall a burning of the houſe, we put it out if we be able: A hatchet or a knife is made to cut, but when it comes to have no edge at all, ſo that it will not do the buſineſs that it ſerveth for, we throw it by into a corner, and provide another. A Potter makes a veſſel to keep liquid things, but if it have a crack, or hole in it, ſo that it will not ſerve for that purpoſe, he even daſhes it in pieces. So Jeſus Chriſt hath made us for himſelf, his own glory; but if we be unſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to this end, and if he finde we do not glorifie him, but diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, and ſhame him, he will break us with a rod of iron, and daſh us in pieces like a Potters veſſel. We will not ſerve his turn, nor the end for which he made us, and therefore he will caſt us away; for what ſhall he do with us? If any of us have an inſtrument that is very uſefull to us, we will be very chary of it, and very carefull that we do not loſe it; but if it be of no uſe, we reckon it of no value, yea many times we break it, or we burn it in a paſſion, and there is an end of it. So Jeſus Chriſt will deal with us my Brethren; if we be ſerviceable to the end for which he made us, he will keep us, and preſerve us: But if we be unuſefull to him, or if we do not glorifie him, he will ruine and deſtroy us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Conſider Chriſt will make you recompence for any honour that you
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:46169:39"/>
bring to him, you ſhall have it back again, and that with profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. If you honour Jeſus Chriſt, he will do as much for you, he will honour you again; it is his Promiſe, and he will be faithfull in it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Them that honour me, I will honour.</hi> Men are exceedingly, and almoſt univerſally deceived in this particular: they think the ready way to honour, is to ſet up themſelves, and to briſle their plumes, to ſtrut and ſwell, and ſwagger in the world; to take all wayes that they can think upon, to make themſelves ſeem great and honourable in the eyes of others; but in the mean time they neglect Chriſt, they take no courſe at all to advance his glory. Alas, theſe men are quite out, if they would have true honour, their buſineſs and their work muſt be to ſet up Chriſt, and then he will be ſure to ſet up them again. If we take care to honour him, he will take care to honour us; if we do the one of them, we need not doubt to truſt him with the other. So that you ſee my Brethren, if we would be honoured and eſteemed, we have no more to do but only this, to glorifie the Lord Chriſt, to magnifie him, and to make him great, and then he is engaged to take care of our eſteem and credit in the world. But on the other ſide if we diſhonour and deſpiſe him, let us do what we can to raiſe our ſelves, and get our ſelves a name, it ſhall be all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when all is done he will caſt ignominy and contempt upon us, as he tells us in the fore-alledged Text, <hi>They that honour me, I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly ſet by.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſider with your ſelves how you will gratifie (if I might expreſs it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo) or rather pleaſe the Father, in glorifying of his Son Chriſt. It is a thing that fathers take delight and pleaſure in, to ſee their ſons advanced to honour; and truly ſo doth God the Father in reference to Jeſus Chriſt. He loves to ſee him ſet up, and to ſee him made glorious, and that not only as he is his Son, in whom his very ſoul delighteth, but as it hath been his decree and purpoſe from eternity to have him glorified. You hear it hath been the deſign of God to glorifie his Son Chriſt, and a deſign on which his heart is ſet; and ſo the promoting of it by your means, muſt needs be very pleaſing to him: you may be ſure that he will vote it to be acceptable ſervice. And even as they that hinder and oppoſe this great buſineſs are oppoſites to God: ſo they that further and promote it, cloſe with him, and carry on his buſineſs, and he will take it very kindly at their hands, to have a thing which he is ſo intent upon brought to paſs by their means. Theſe things may ſtir us up, my Brethren, to comply with God in this great Deſign of his, touching the glorifying of his Son Chriſt.</p>

The firſt is taken from the end, why he deſireth to be glorified, or to have glory from the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> that he might be enabled to bring glory to the Father; <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorifie thee.</hi> The ſecond Argument is drawn <hi>à congruo,</hi> from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity; it was but meet and congruous that he ſhould be glorified, or that he ſhould have glory from the Father, ſeeing he had power from him. He had received power from him, and therefore it was fit that he ſhould have glory too; for power and glory ought to go together: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on this ground our Saviour urgeth it, you ſee; <hi>Father glorifie thy Son,</hi> as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</p>
               <p>As thou haſt given him power, ſo be prevailed withall to give him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too, the concomitant of power. The third is drawn from the deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cauſe: Chriſt had glorified the Father, and therefore thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthy to have glory from the Father; <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now, O Father, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie me with thy ſelf,</hi> and ſo on.</p>
               <p>At this time, I ſhall pitch on the firſt Argument, with which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour preſſeth this requeſt of his, and it is taken from the end, why he deſireth to have glory from the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> That he may be enabled to bring glory to the Father, <hi>Glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Me thinks he ſeems to intimate he could not glorifie him much in the condition he was in at preſent, he was in ſuch a ſtate of ignominy, and abaſure, and contempt, in relation to the world, that he was not capable of bringing in the Father any conſiderable honour, while he remained in this caſe: And therefore he entreats the Father to raiſe him, and advance him, that he may do as much for him again, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, that thy Son alſo, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then as we have formerly obſerved, that it is the Deſign of God the Father to glorifie his Son; ſo hence we may obſerve,</p>

                  <p>You ſee he begs it only upon this account, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son:</hi> What, that he may detain and keep it to himſelf? No, that he may return it to the Father, <hi>That thy Son alſo may glorifie thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou wilt glorifie me, thou ſhalt be no loſer by it; no, thou ſhalt have it back again, and that with profit, and advantage too; thou ſhalt be glorified by me; I will not keep the glory which thou layeſt out upon me in my own hands, but I will give it up entire, and undiminiſhed to thy ſelf again: It is not for my own ſake that I beg it, but for thine.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome rays of glory which God was pleaſed to dart forth upon the Son in his condition of abaſure: and if you mark his carriage
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:46169:40"/>
in the Goſpel Story, you ſhall find that he was always carefull to make them to reflect on God again. As when he did his Miracles, which was a means to ſet him up (you know) in the eyes of all that ſaw them, he was extreamly cautious that the honour might be rendred to his Father. And hence he was not wont to do them in his own name, nor in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by his own power, though both were ſuitable enough to his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being God as well as Man; but in the name, and by the ſtrength and the aſſiſtance of the Father. And therefore when he raiſed <hi>Lazarus,</hi> he did not ſeem to do it of himſelf (though that he might have done as God) but lift up his eyes and prayed his Father, that he would ſhew himſelf in that buſineſs, that ſo the glory might be his, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.42. and addeth, that he did it for the peoples ſake that ſtood by, <hi>that they might know that God had ſent him.</hi> That they might underſtand that he performed ſuch works as theſe, as one that was ſubſervient to the Father, in them, and that was ſent out by him. And therefore he is always minding them on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Miſſion from the Father, that ſo if any thing praiſe-worthy did appear in him, or were done by him, it might be rendred and aſcribed to the Father. The ſixth of <hi>John</hi> is full of ſuch inſinuations; <hi>I come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to do the will of him that ſent me, and not to do my own will,</hi> at <hi>ver.</hi> 38. And in another place he tells them that he honoured not himſelf, but his Father honoured him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.54. He honours me, and I honour not my ſelf; I do not keep his honour to my ſelf; but I honour him again, with which accordeth that expreſſion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.31. <hi>Now is the Son of man glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:</hi> and what follows, <hi>and God is glorified in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that you ſee the Son takes glory from the Father, to this end, that he may bring glory to the Father.</p>
                  <p>And it is very congruous that it ſhould be ſo, becauſe as Man, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> he is the Servant of the Father; he was ſent down by him from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon his errand, and upon his buſineſs, and to do the work which he appointed him to do. It was our Saviours own acknowledgement, when he had done and ended all, <hi>I have finiſhed the work,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt me to do,</hi> Joh. 17.4. <hi>q.d.</hi> I have approved my ſelf a faithfull Servant to thee, I have done thy work, and I have done it fully and compleatly: And he is often ſpeaking of his being ſent out by the Father, and that to do his will, and not his own, his work and not his own, to ſignifie that he was in the ſtate and the condition of a ſervant to the Father. Now a ſervant muſt not ſeek his own honour, but the honour of his Maſter. As he muſt do his Maſters will, his Maſters work, and not his own; ſo he muſt do it for his Maſters ends, and not his own. If his Maſter ſet him up, he muſt improve it to his Maſters commendation: And ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt being as Man and Mediator in the condition of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to his Father, it was his duty in the execution of his Mediatorſhip to aim at his Maſters glory, to do all things for his end, <hi>viz.</hi> his glory. Or otherwiſe in doing his Fathers work, his Fathers will, he might even ſerve himſelf, and not his Father. If any honour did accrew to him in the performance of his Office, he was bound to aſcribe it to the Father; it was his duty as a ſervant ſo to do, and ſo accordingly he did, and this was one ground of it, why he did no otherwiſe deſire to have glory from

the Father, but that he might bring glory to the Father.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> There may a ſecond reaſon be aſſigned as he is God, for ſo he and the Father are one, and conſequently his glory and the Fathers are one. So that no marvel that he deſire as God to bring glory to the Father, ſeeing in doing ſo he brings glory to himſelf; As on the other ſide it is no marvel, that the Father takes occaſion ſtill to glorifie the Son, ſeeing in doing ſo, he glorifies himſelf. You ſhall obſerve that they are always ſetting one another up; the Father he is always ſetting up the Son; the Son upon the other ſide is always ſetting up the Father; and it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that it ſhould be ſo, becauſe in ſetting one another up, they do indeed ſet up themſelves. If the Son were to loſe the glory that he gives the Father, we need not doubt he would be loth enough to part with it:So if the Father were to loſe the glory that he gives the Son, he would not let him have it neither; for he hath ſaid, <hi>He will not give his glory to another.</hi> But heres the buſineſs now my Brethren, when he gives glory to the Son, he doth not give it to another, but himſelf. And ſo the Son when he gives glory to the Father, he doth not give it to another, but himſelf. They are ſo abſolutely one in all reſpects, as God, that the glory of the one is the glory of the other: And therefore it is ſaid that God is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.31. Mark that expreſſion, <hi>Not by the Son, but in the Son; for he is glorified in that the Son is glorified.</hi> The glory that may ſeem to be imparted to the Son, darts back again upon him by reflection; it is doubled by this means, and conſequently he is not a loſer by it, but a gainer. If he glorifie his Son, his Son alſo glorifies him; ſo that no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if there be ſuch an exchange of glory continually between the Father and the Son, and putting of it always over to the other. That place is very notable to this purpoſe. <hi>John</hi> 12.28. if it be read as ſome have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it, and the Original will fitly bear; ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Father glorifie thy Name;</hi> the Father anſwers by a voice from Heaven, <hi>I have glorified thee</hi> (not glorified it, as in our laſt Tranſlation, but) <hi>glorified thee,</hi> and I will glorifie thee again; the Son he prays not, Father glorifie me, but thy ſelf, thy own name, <hi>Father glorifie thy name:</hi> the Father anſwers not, I have glorified my name, my ſelf; but, <hi>I have glorified thee; Neuter ſibi, uterque alteri gloriam attribuens,</hi> as one notes upon the text. The Son de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires the Father, that he will glorifie himſelf, and not him; the Father tells the Son that he hath glorified him, and not himſelf; or if you will, that he hath done what he deſires; he hath glorified himſelf in glorifying him: ſo that the one is glorified in the glory of the other.</p>

                     </label> Now, is it ſo my Brethren, that it is the deſire of Chriſt to have glory from the Father to the end, &amp;c. I ſhall apply it in the firſt place my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, to perſwade you to learn of Chriſt in this particular, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath taught you in another caſe, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek:</hi> Learn to be as I am, learn to do as I do: So be you followers of Chriſt in this thing, and do you learn of him, when you deſire or ſeek for any thing at Gods hands, any place, or any gifts that will advance or ſet you up among men, that you deſire it for no other end, but this, that you may glorifie the Lord with it. It is a uſual thing with many of us; we would get up into ſome place of dignity, we would have extraordinary parts and gifts,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:46169:41"/>
we would be eminent in knowledge, and in grace; we would have God to honour us with theſe things, and we are very earneſt and importunate with him about it; but can we ſay in the uprightneſs of our hearts, as Chriſt doth? <hi>Father, we pray that thou wouldſt honour us with theſe things, that we alſo may glorifie thee:</hi> That by this means we may be capable of bringing thee the more glory. It is not to ſet up our ſelves that we deſire this dignity, or theſe accompliſhments in any kinde, but that we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thee. Do we not know that we deſire ſuch things as theſe too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of us, meerly for our own ends, for the attainment of our own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that we may get our ſelves a name, that we may be accepted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and eſteemed? Do not our hearts accuſe us, that we have ſuch low aims as theſe are? Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, let us conform our ſelves to Chriſt in this particular; any thing that we deſire that will be honourable to us, let us deſire it in reference to Gods glory: if we would have more knowledge, and more grace, and more ability to holy duties, let it not be to this end that we may be ſome body among the Saints, and that our names with <hi>Davids</hi> may be much ſet by: If we would have more wealth, and more power, let it not be that we may ſtrut and ſwell, and ſwagger in the world: but that if God ſhall honour us in this regard, we alſo may glorifie him, that having had ſuch honour from him, we may bring the more to him.</p>
                  <p>And truly, if we ſeek it to this end, we have the greater hope to ſpeed with God in our Petitions, and to obtain the gifts and bleſſings that we ſeek for, and that upon a double ground which I ſhall briefly ſet before you, as inducements to perſwade.</p>
                  <p>If we deſire that which will honour us, that we may honour God with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it, we may be like to have it upon this account, that he himſelf, in ſome reſpects, is intereſſed and concerned in it. It will be advantagious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore he will give it us: he ſees that we will lay it out for him, and therefore he will lay it out on us. He will entruſt us with the talent, which he perceives we mean to uſe for his profit; and this is one eſpecial cauſe why many men want thoſe abilities, and thoſe endowments which they eagerly deſire and thirſt after, becauſe he knows they deſire them out of pride, that they may glorifie themſelves with them. The Lord reſiſts the proud, but gives his grace unto the humble, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. He will not have his gifts to be the ſtales and proſtitutes of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the oyl to feed our baſe humours.</p>
                  <p>If we deſire that which will honour us, that we may honour God with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it, we may be like to have it upon this account, that Jeſus Chriſt will intercede for it; he never intercedes for any thing but only in theſe two caſes, when that which is deſired, if it be granted, will promote his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers glory or his peoples good; and this you ſee is the firſt and great Caſe. If he perceive that we intend to glorifie his Father with the abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, or gifts, or bleſſings that we ſue for; then inſtrikes he with us in our Petition, and ſeconds our requeſt to God. He tels his Father there is ſuch a Suit of ſuch a Member, or of ſuch a Saint of mine, I pray thee hearken to it, and diſpatch it, for it concerns thine own honour. Here he would have a little more grace, but I aſſure thee (for I know his breaſt)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:46169:42"/>
it is not to be proud, or to lift up himſelf with it, but to advance and lift up thee. Poor ſoul, he thinks he never honours thee enough, and therefore he would fain have more grace, that he may bring thee more glory: Come I beſeech thee, ſet thy treaſure open, and give him out a large ſhare, for thou thy ſelf will be a gainer by it: If thou honour him, he will alſo glorifie thee.</p>

If God have glorified us in any kind, let us alſo glorifie him. If any honour do accrue to any of us from our created, or acquired, or infuſed abilities, from any thing that we have done, from any thing that we have ſuffered, let us not keep it in our own hands, but return it back to God. If men at any time applaud us, or commend us for our gifts, if they admire our graces, or abilities in any kinde, and ſay you have done this or that incomparably well, and our hearts begin to riſe, as they are apt to do on ſuch a ſcore, let us not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate this honour to our ſelves; let us not be unwilling to forgo it all again, and to ſpare it all to God: Aſſoon as he hath honoured us, let us be ſure to glorifie him; let us put it all away, and ſhake it off, and ſay as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Not unto us,</hi> I ſay again, <hi>not unto us, but to the name of God be all the glory.</hi> It was he that wrought all our works for us, that put all thoſe gracious words into our minds (the matter was not of our own invention but of his ſuggeſtion) that did all in theſe duties. <hi>We laboured,</hi> we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>but yet not we,</hi> not we only, not we chiefly, <hi>but the grace of God that was in us.</hi> And therefore when theſe Crowns of honour ſhall at any time be ſet upon our heads, let us with the four and twenty Elders caſt them down before the throne of God, acknowledging with them, that <hi>unto him alone belongeth honour and glory and praiſe:</hi> And we ſhould be the more cautious of arrogating any of this honour to our ſelves, which indeed belongs to God, becauſe he is ſo infinitely jealous of his glory: he hath profeſt it is a thing that he will never part withall; he will not give it to another; ſo that if we preſume to keep it when it comes into our hands, we ſhall be loſers by it in the end, the Lord will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it upon us to our own ſhame. There is a ſad example of it in proud <hi>Herod,</hi> who being much applauded and admired by the People for a certain Speech he made to a popular Aſſembly, inſomuch that they cried out, <hi>The voice of God, and not of man;</hi> becauſe he gave not God the glory, which the people gave him, he was eaten up of worms, and died a very ignominious and baſe death. Well then, the glory that is given us by men, in any caſe let us be ſure to give to God, that we may ſay to him, not much unlike as Chriſt doth, <hi>Thou haſt glorified us, and we have glorified thee.</hi> And thus of the firſt Argument with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth this requeſt of his, which hath been taken from the end why he deſireth to be glorified, or to have glory from the Father.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, and it is <hi>à congruo,</hi> from congruity; it was but meet and congruous that he ſhould have glory from the Father, ſeeing he had power from him. <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:46169:42"/>The force and vigour of this ſecond Reaſon of our Saviour (as I take it) lies in this, That power and glory ought to go together. He looks upon it as a reaſonable thing, that he that is endued with power, ſhould be adorned with glory. And hence he knits them both together in the Lords Prayer by the connective particle, the power and the glory. So here he had the power, and therefore thinks it fit that he ſhould have the glory. He tels his Father, that he had received power from him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was congruous that he ſhould have glory from him. And on this ground he preſſeth it in this Petition to his Father, <hi>q.d.</hi> As thou haſt given me power, ſo be prevailed withall to give me glory, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three things we have to be conſidered in the words. 1. The thing in it ſelf with which our Saviour is inveſted and endued, and this you ſee is power over all fleſh. 2. The means by which he comes to be inveſted with it, <hi>viz.</hi> by free donation and diſpenſation from his Father; he had this power becauſe his Father gave it him, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi> 3. The end for which he was inveſted with it, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the firſt particular, the thing it ſelf with which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is inveſted and endued. And here you may take notice in the firſt place of the nature of it, and in the next place of the meaſure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it.

                     </gap> power. And then you have the meaſure and extent of it, it is not over ſome, but over all fleſh, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, my Brethren, you muſt know that there are two ſorts of power. There is either <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, either <hi>potentia,</hi> or <hi>poteſtas:</hi> Or to be plain, either power of ability, or power of authority. Power of ability, by which he that enjoys it, is enabled to do things <hi>de facto:</hi> Power of authority, by which he that enjoys it is enabled to do things <hi>de jure.</hi> This latter is apparently intended in my Text, <hi>As thou haſt given him,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Our laſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation reads it power; it would have been more clear and eaſie, if they had rendred it authority: <hi>as thou haſt given him authority over all fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this authority you ſee is of a very large extent, it is <hi>over all fleſh.</hi> You muſt conceive it over all mankinde. It is a uſual form of ſpeech, as I might give you divers inſtances out of the Scripture: <hi>God looked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all fleſh had corrupted his way,</hi> Gen. 6.12. The corruption there is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, of which no other fleſh is capable, but that of mankinde only: So <hi>Luke</hi> 3.6. <hi>All fleſh ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God:</hi> And in this ſenſe you are to apprehend the ſame expreſſion in my Text: <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh;</hi> over all humane fleſh, or the whole race of Mankinde.</p>
                  <p>And this authority you muſt conceive him to enjoy and exerciſe, as he is Man and Mediator of the Church; for that Authority which he enjoys as God, he had from all eternity as co-equal with the Father. He had it not made over to him by the Father; no, it was his own original, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:46169:43"/>
and native right, together with the Father. Whereas the power intended in my Text, is that which he received by way of diſpenſation, and donation from the Father, <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh:</hi> You ſee the meaning of the Words, the Point is clear.</p>

Theſe two may ſeem to claſh and interfere, he hath put all things into his hand, and he hath put all things under his feet: But the fence and meaning is, he hath put all things of one ſort into his hands; conceive it, all his people and his friends, concerning whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>No man can pluck them out of my hand.</hi> He hath put all things of another ſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet: conceive it, all his enemies, concerning whom the Father ſaith unto the Son, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, untill I make thy enemies thy foot ſtool:</hi> So that you ſee apparently, Chriſt hath an univerſal Juriſdiction; he hath all things in his power, under his dominion: ſome things in his hand, to honour them, and ſome things under foot to ſhame them: Some things in his hand to keep them, and ſome things under feet to tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and to ruine them for ever. If any were without the verge of the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, the Kings and Princes of the earth might ſeem to have the ſtrongeſt plea for this exemption: But God hath made him his <hi>firſt-born, higher then the kings of the earth,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89 27. Not higher in regard of dignity of nature only (for ſo the Angels, as you know; are higher then the greateſt earthly Princes) but higher in regard of Juriſdiction too; and hence he hath that name upon his veſture writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in great Capitals, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.16. <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> So that the point you ſee is fully proved. <hi>That all mankinde,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now to unfold the point a little to you, that you may ſee it in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and in the full dimenſion of it: There is a twofold power of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or Authority, which Jeſus Chriſt as Man and Mediator of the Church is veſted with, and exerciſeth over all fleſh. A Legiſlative power, and a Judiciary power: A Legiſlative power to give Laws; and a Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary power, to execute the Laws that he hath given.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt then Chriſt hath an univerſal Legiſlative power, a power of giving
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46169:43"/>
Laws to all fleſh. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle ſtiles him <hi>the Law-giver,</hi> Jam. 4.12. and that excluſively; he tels us, <hi>that here is but one, and that is Chriſt.</hi> There is one ſuch, and no more; the univerſal Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power is in himſelf alone, and not in any other, either with him, or beſides him: It is his own prerogative, it is a flower of the Imperial Crown of heaven which he communicateth not to any other, to give Law to all fleſh. And hence the Law is ſaid in Scripture to come out of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as you may ſee that place fore-inſtanced, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>for out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law,</hi> which is the Seat of Chriſts Kingdom: It is not ſaid to be impoſed on <hi>Zion</hi> only, to be reſtrained to <hi>Zion</hi> only, but out of <hi>Zion</hi> to go forth to all fleſh: Becauſe our Saviour, though he be King of all the earth, yet he keeps his Court in <hi>Zion,</hi> in the Church; there is his place of reſidence, and thence he dates and ſendeth forth his Royal Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Edicts, <hi>Witneſs our ſelf at Zion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt by vertue of this Legiſlative power of his, gives Laws both to the outward and the inward man. Both to the members, and the conſcience, and that without reſtraint of all fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath an univerſal Legiſlative power, a power of giving Laws to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all mankinde, ſo as to binde their members, and their outward man. And hence the Moral Law, which is an univerſal Law, which no man is exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, which takes hold on all fleſh, which all men ſhall be judged by, as the Apoſtle tels us, is called the Law of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Bear you one anothers burthen, and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt,</hi> that is, the Law of love; for that, my Brethren, is the Law of Chriſt. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you; Novum quia renovatum, A new Commandment give I unto you, that you love one another:</hi> And what is love but the fulfilling of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks? And yet this ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of this Law of love, calls it not the Law of nature, but the Law of Chriſt, <hi>Bear ye one anothers burthen</hi> (which is a ſpecial act of love) and ſo fulfill the Law of Chriſt: So that the Moral Law you ſee, my Brethren, is the Law of Chriſt: and therefore he is pleaſed to own it, and to call it his Commandment, <hi>John</hi> 15.12. to fortifie it with his own authority (as in the Sermon on the Mount) and to impoſe the precept of it on the people.</p>
                  <p>And that this Moral Law is univerſal, and extends to all fleſh, appears by this, that it is not impoſed alone upon the members of the Church, but on the very heathen too, upon the Kings and Princes of the earth, as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Kings and Princes of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take Counſel together againſt the Lord and his Chriſt, ſaying, Let us break their bond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us,</hi> that is the Precepts and Commandments, not of the Goſpel only, but alſo of the Moral Law: Which is the Law of nature, and obliged not the Jews alone, but all the Nations of the world: So that no marvel though they both conſpire together to rid themſelves of theſe bonds. The Heathen rage, the people of the Jews imagine, the Kings and Rulers (not of Jews only, but) of all the earth, ſtand up and ſay, <hi>Let us break theſe bonds aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and caſt away theſe cords from us.</hi> Theſe bonds and cords which are impoſed and laid upon us all, with which we all of us do finde our ſelves
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:46169:44"/>
reſtrained and bound, that is, the Precepts and Commandments of the Moral Law: So that you ſee, Chriſt by his Legiſlative power gives Law to all fleſh, as to the outward man, and to the Members.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> He gives Law to all fleſh, as to the inward man, and to the conſcience. The Law of Jeſus Chriſt is Spiritual, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. not only in the nature of it, but alſo in the ſubjects of it. It takes hold upon the ſouls, the ſpirits, and conſciences of men: It captivates their very thoughts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5. And herein Jeſus Chriſt is ſingular, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſteth ſuch authority as no one exerciſeth but himſelf. Its true, that men do oftentimes give Laws unto the outward man, and to the members in politick and civil things, and then they do it too as Chriſts Vicegerents and his Deputies, they do it under him, and by authority from him. But it is Chriſt, and he alone that gives Laws unto the Conſcience in holy and religious things. He delegates the former power to Magiſtrates, who in the ſame reſpect are ſtiled the Miniſters of Chriſt: But this authority he makes not over to any of the ſons of men: And yet he exerciſes this authority over all the ſons of men, ſo that there is not one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from his Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As Jeſus Chriſt hath a Legiſlative power, ſo a Judiciary power. As he hath a Legiſlative power to give Laws, ſo a Judiciary power to execute the Laws that he hath given: And this is univerſal too, my Brethren, as the other is. As he gives his Laws to all, ſo he executes his Laws on all fleſh. And therefore he is called a Judge very often in the Scripture: I need not give you inſtances, for they are known: yea, he is ſtiled the Judge of all, and not alone of all that are alive, but even of thoſe that are departed and deceaſed, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. where he is ſtiled the Judge of the quick and dead. Its true that other Judges in the world can judge the quick, they can deal well enough with thoſe that are alive; but if they die, they are gone out of their hands for ever. But Jeſus Chriſt is Judge of all fleſh, quick fleſh, and dead fleſh, Judge of quick and dead too. Death cannot reſcue men out of his hands; no, my Beloved, he can purſue them to eternity, and follow them into another world, and there can execute the rigour of his wrath upon them to the very utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>And as he is the Judge of all perſons, ſo he is Judge of all caſes: <hi>All judgement is committed to him,</hi> not ſome, but <hi>all judgement, Job</hi> 5.22. whether the caſe be manifeſt and open, or whether it be hid and ſecret, all is one, Chriſt is Judge of both theſe; and this is ſingular to Jeſus Chriſt. Men can do nothing in a caſe that is abſolutely ſecret. If a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be committed, and nothing be diſcovered any way; no, not ſo much as by a circumſtance, or by ſome grounds of ſtrong ſuſpition, what can an earthly Judge do? He knows the Law is broken, but yet he cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the ſentence of the Law, becauſe he is not able to diſcover the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. Now Jeſus Chriſt is not to ſeek in ſuch Caſes. To him all things are naked and uncovered. And therefore he brings every work to judgement, and every ſecret thing, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.14. And the Apoſtle tels us of a day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to his Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. So that you ſee no fleſh can
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46169:44"/>
eſcape his judgement, let the man be what he will, and let the cauſe be what it will.</p>
                  <p>Now this Judiciary power of Chriſts conſiſts of two things; in paſſing ſentence upon all fleſh; in executing the ſentence after it is paſt. A word or two of theſe in order.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath the power of paſſing ſentence upon all fleſh. All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is under his authority in this reſpect: and they <hi>muſt all appear before the Judgement Seat of Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. there to receive their laſt doom, either of abſolution or condemnation. Sometimes he paſſeth ſentence on them in the Court of Conſcience here, he ſealeth up mens condemnation to them, and makes it to become a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing: <hi>They are condemned already, in themſelves, and there remaineth nothing to them but a certain looking for of judgment,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. And on the other ſide, he ſealeth up mens abſolution, he ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Pardons to the conſcience: This he hath power to do, and this he doth ſometimes on earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9 6. The Son of man hath power on earth to forgive ſins. At utmoſt, in the laſt and dreadfull day, all the dead both great and ſmall, appear before him, and receive a ſentence from him, either the one way or the other, as you may ſee, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.12.</p>
                  <p>And as he hath the power of Paſſing, ſo the power of Executing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> upon all Fleſh. All mankinde is under his authority in this reſpect: And therefore the Apoſtle having ſpoken of his Legiſlative power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he comes to this judiciary Power, <hi>James</hi> 4.12. There is one Law-giver, (ſaith he) And what can he but give the Law? yes, he can execute the Law too: and therefore it is added preſently, Who is able both to ſave, and to deſtroy: to ſave thoſe that are acquitted by the Law, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy thoſe that are condemned by the Law.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes he executeth his ſentence partly here: The works of ſome men go before to judgement, (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24.) Chriſt puniſheth the wicked, and rewards the Godly in this preſent world; but the full retribution of them both, he keepeth and reſerveth to the day of his appearing, when both of them ſhall have their full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) He ſends not his reward before him, he leaves not his reward behind him, but brings it with him, to diſpenſe it when he comes: And then he will diſcover it to all the world, that he hath power over all fleſh, for he will then diſpoſe eternally of all fleſh, either in heaven or in hell.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> NOw is it ſo, that all mankind is under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, under his Legiſlative power, ſo as to give Law to them? Then firſt of all, they are ſeverely to be cenſured, who ſubmit not to the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, who do not yield obedience to the Law he gives them; let him lay what commands he will upon them, they are at a point for that, they will not be obedient to them: they break the bonds of Chriſt in ſunder, and caſt away his cords from them. Now the Delinquents here are twofold, according to the twofold Law which the authority of Jeſus Chriſt impoſeth on his Subjects. I ſay, there is a twofold Law which the authority of Jeſus Chriſt impoſeth upon men; the Law of Faith, and the Law of Love. We read of both theſe (my Brethren) in the Goſpel, and of both as his Laws. And ſo accordingly there are two ſorts of men, who ſtoop not to the Legiſlative power of Jeſus Chriſt; I ſhall proceed with them in order.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt of them are unbelievers; they violate the Law of faith, and ſo ſubmit not to the power which God hath given him over all fleſh. You muſt know that Jeſus Chriſt requireth all men to believe. <hi>You believe in God,</hi> (ſaith he to his Diſciples) <hi>believe alſo in me,</hi> John 14.1. And therefore the Apoſtle tels us of the Law of faith, and ſetteth it in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Law of works, the Moral Law, as you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Now the great thing which this Law of faith requires, is, the receiving of the Son of God upon the terms that he is offered in the Goſpel, as you have been often ſhewed. And it requires it on the greateſt penalty, even everlaſting condemnation, which is as certain to the unbelievers, as if it had already paſt upon them. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already,</hi> John 3, 18. And yet alas, how many are there who ſubmit not to this Law of faith; who though Chriſt be propoſed and tendred to them in the Goſpel, though he be even forced and preſſed upon them, though Chriſt command them to believe, yet they will not be obedient! Indeed if he had no authority to impoſe this Law upon them, they had reaſon to ſtand out: but God hath given him power to do this, yea, he himſelf requires the very ſame thing. <hi>This is his Commandment that we ſhould believe in the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.23. ſo that you ſee (my Brethren) this is the Commandment of the Father, and this is the Commandment of the Son, both joyn in this Law; and therefore they are deeply to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, who are refractory to ſo great a Law as this.</p>
               <p>And that it may the better work and take upon them, I ſhall ſhew them, firſt the ſin, and ſecondly the danger of their diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That it is a ſin not to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, is evident by that which hath been ſaid, becauſe it is the violation of a Law, the Law of faith. But more then ſo, it is a very great ſin. It is a ſin of no ordinary ſize; no, (my beloved) it is a ſinning ſin, it is abundantly, and out of meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:46169:45"/>
It is a ſin indeed to violate the Law of works which the Apoſtle ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, becauſe it was delivered by the hand of <hi>Moſes:</hi> But it is a greater ſin to violate the Law of faith, and that both with relation to the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>Firſt for the Father, it is an horrible indignity to him; it is the baſeſt undervaluing and deſpiſing of his love that can be; he gives his Son out of his boſom, to ſuffer ſhame and death for poor Creatures, and having done it, he ſends his Meſſengers to mind men of the danger they are in without Chriſt, and to exhibite and propoſe him to them as the means, the only means of their ſalvation: and as endeavouring to overcome men with his goodneſs, he doth in love and pity beg them, and beſeech them to accept of it; And what is the event of this? why (my beloved] when he hath abaſed himſelf ſo low, and ſtooped ſo much below himſelf as to become a ſuitor to them to receive his Son, they carry matters ſo as if he ſtood in need of them; as if he came to make a motion to them for his own advantage; as if he knew not what to do, if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe his Son. Is not this good uſage? that when he hath deſcended ſo in ways of mercy, they ſhould ſhake him off, and tell him in effect, that his profered wares ſtink, and that they do not need him, nor his Son neither: he may go offer him to them that have a mind to him.</p>
               <p>Oh what abuſe of love is this! Oh what an high indignity! what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable provocation! even to incenſe the Lord ſo far, as to cauſe him to reſolve that he will never ſtoop ſo low again; that he will never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute his Son again to the diſdain and the refuſal of a company of baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful men; that he will make them rue the time that ever they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned this mercy to them.</p>
               <p>Then for the Son (my Brethren) in the ſecond place, it is an high af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to him, and ſo in that reſpect a great ſin. It coſt him dear to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and obtain remiſſion and ſalvation for a company of loſt creatures; indeed his deareſt life, his deareſt blood. And is it not an horrible indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſlight and to deſpiſe ſo great ſalvation? to trample under foot the ſon of God: to ſcorn ſuch rich and precious mercy? yet this all unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do, if not in their intention, yet in the iſſue and event. Truly their ſin in this reſpect, is greater then the ſin of Devils, whoſe nature Chriſt hath not aſſumed (<hi>he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of</hi> Abraham) for whom he never ſuffered, and to whom he was never offered; They will have ſomething to excuſe themſelves withall, ſomething to plead before the Lord in the great and dreadful day.

               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as the ſin is great, ſo in the ſecond place, the miſery and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will be great alſo. There will be no avoiding of it; <hi>for how ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation!</hi> Heb. 2.3. There will be no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during of it, it will be infinitely heavy; it will be eaſier for Turks and Pagans in the day of judgement then for ſuch wretches. Alas poor ſouls, that as if their condemnation were not deep enough already, the incarnation, and the paſsion, and the offer of a Saviour, the richeſt mercies in themſelves, that ever were beſtowed upon the Creature, ſhould acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally encreaſe it. That Chriſt ſhould die and ſhed his blood, to ſink men deeper into hell, then if he had not died at all (for this is the event and iſſue of it) this is a lamentable thing indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond ſort of ſuch as ſtoop not to the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and to his Legiſlative power, are ſuch as violate the Law of Love; I mean the Moral Law, the decalogue, the ten Commandments, for that (my Brethren) is the Law of love. And therefore the Apoſtle tels us that love is the fulfilling of the Law; he means apparently the Moral Law. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. and he that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law: ſee the eighth verſe of that chapter: in which reſpect our Saviour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf divides the Law into theſe two Commandments: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and the neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> what then? it may be you will ſay, Doth Chriſt by his authority impoſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law on men, the ten Commandments of the Decalogue? The Law of faith is his indeed, but is the Law of works his too? Yes the Law of works is his; for he requireth works as well as faith. And the faith which he beſtows upon his members, works by love. And love is his own commandment, ſo he cals it, John 15.12. <hi>This is my Commandment that ye love one another.</hi> Indeed he rules his Subjects by the Moral Law, that is, the precepts and commandments of it are the Statutes of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Its true, when it was firſt delivered to <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, it came to him but in the hand of the Creator only; But it comes to us (my Brethren) in the hands of the Redeemer, and of the Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, who was typified by <hi>Moſes</hi> at the delivery of the Law, the ſecond time upon Mount <hi>Sinai, Gal.</hi> 3.19. And hence the precepts of it, are ſtiled not the bonds of God only, but the bonds of Chriſt too; Pſal. 2.2. <hi>Let us break their bonds aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us.</hi> The Goſpel all men yield, is Chriſts; he is in a peculiar way the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Goſpel, and therefore it is called the word of Chriſt. Now the Commandments of the Law, are all of them revived in the Goſpel. The whole of what the Law requires, is for the manner and meaſure of obedience exacted alſo in the Goſpel; there is no duty which the Law en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, but it is taught us in the Goſpel. The Goſpel teacheth <hi>to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent world:</hi> Titus 2.12. ſoberly towards our ſelves, righteouſly towards our Brethren, and piouſly towards our God.</p>
               <p>And theſe Particulars apparently involve and comprehend all the Commandments of the Moral Law from the beginning of it to the end; There being nothing in the Decalogue, the Ten Commandments, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, or required, but may be reduced to one of theſe three heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:46169:46"/>So then you ſee my Brethren, not the Law of faith only, but the Law of works too, is Chriſts Law; or if it be not Chriſts Law, it can be no Law at all; The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son. And conſequently he that violates this Law of works, reſiſteth the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and the power with which he is inveſted by his Father to give Law to all fleſh.</p>
               <p>And yet alas how many are there who live in the reſolved, and the conſtant breach of all the precepts and commandments of the Law of Chriſt, who in their practice daily break theſe bonds aſunder, and caſt away theſe cords from them, who are not ſubject to the Law of Chriſt nor indeed can they be! If it be preſſed home upon them, to bind them to the good behaviour, and to reſtrain them from their ſinful and ungracious courſes, they are out of all patience. If the commands of Chriſt be laid upon them, to hold them faſt to duty and obedience and to abridge them of their carnal liberty, if they be told they muſt no take their old courſes, but they muſt hear and pray, and faſt, and ſanctifie Gods holy day, and live ſtrictly, they will be very much incenſed; The Law of Chriſt is too ſevere and ſtrict for them, it curbeth and abridgeth them too much, and therefore they will ſhake it off from them; And as the Lunatick who was reſtored by our Saviour to his reaſon, brake all the bonds and cords with which they bound him, ſo theſe unreaſonable Creatures deal with Chriſts Law; nothing will hold them to obedience. Let him lay what command he will upon them, they will ſurely break it, that they may live at liberty, and walk according to their own humours. Yea, ſin in ſuch by the Commandment becomes exceeding ſinful, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. Not by way of declaration (for that is not the purpoſe and intention of the place) but by way of Irritation; When the Commandment labours to lay hold on ſin, to bind him, and to chain him up, then ſin begins to lay about him, to ſtruggle for his libertie, and ſo by accident to be the more ſinful. When we preſs home the precepts of the Law, and urge them hard on wicked men, as there are ſome that yield themſelves up to the binding power and to the obligation of it: ſo there are others that ſtand out againſt the Law, and they are much the worſe for it, and become the more vitious. What? bind and curb, and limit them? tell them that they muſt not ſwear, and they muſt not be unclean? They will not be reſtrained and hampered; they! no they will ſwear the more and drink the more and be unclean the more. They are reſolved with the rebellious Jews, we will not hear, we will not do but we will do as we have done; I will fetch wine, and we will fill our ſelves with ſtrong drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant. Well my beloved, if any of you be at this hand, hear but a few particulars before we part.</p>
               <p>Conſider Chriſt is infinitely tender of his Authority, and of his Law.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> He will not eaſily endure it to be ſleighted and infringed. He came not to deſtroy the Law himſelf; no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he was far from any ſuch intention in his coming, nor will he ſuffer any other to deſtroy it neither. Heaven and Earth ſhall paſs away before one jot or tittle of his Law ſhall paſs away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.5. He had as lief that Heaven and Earth ſhould come to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46169:47"/>
nothing as that his Law ſhould be diſſolved. And judge you then how great their provocation is, who violate and break the precepts of it day by day, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his green cords, as if they had no ſtrength or force at all in them. Could they ſet Heaven and Earth on fire and conſume it into aſhes, they could not anger Chriſt ſo much, nor vex him as they do by this their curſed violation of his bleſſed Law. And there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary peril in the wrath of Chriſt; If once he be incenſed there is very great hazard, and hence ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 2. <hi>ult. Kiſs the ſon leaſt he be angry, and you periſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Conſider that the Law as it hath a commanding power that requireth us to do, ſo it hath a threatning power that obligeth us to ſuffer, in caſe of diſobedience to the Law. As it bindeth men to do the things that are commanded in it, ſo in caſe they do them not (and have no intereſt in Chriſt by faith) it bindeth them to ſuffer all the things that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in it; For every one that doth not every thing that is contained in the Law, is expoſed to the curſe, as you may ſee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. There's not a curſe contained in the book of God from the beginning of it to the end, but ſuch a man lies open to it, and if he perſevere without repentance, he ſhall be ſure to feel it to his pain. Well then, my brethren, you may perhaps out-ſtand the precept, but are you able to out-ſtand the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? You may decline the duty, but are you able alſo to avoid the curſe? Here Chriſt commands, &amp; you replie, We will not hear, we will not do: But when he ſhall pronounce the ſentence of the Law upon you, in the great and great dreadful day, will you replie We will not bear, we will not ſuffer? Will you tell him to his face, We will not go to hell, we will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Law, as you have told him here, We will not be obedient to the Law? Alas it is not all mens ſcorns and haughty looks, it is not all their pride and ſturdineſs that will prevail at that time. No, no, the haughtineſs of men ſhall be brought low, and Chriſt alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Conſider Chriſt hath ability to back and ſecond his authority. All power is given to him, all kinds &amp; all degrees of power, power of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and power of ability. Power of authority alone is but an empty and a deſpicable thing; he that hath it may command, and they whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth (if they pleaſe) may, diſobey, he cannot force them to obedience, nor puniſh them for diſobedience. The hazzard is not great of diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch power. But where ability goes with authority, there the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing of it muſt be full of danger. Now ſo it doth in Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he is peremptory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.11. As I live, ſaith the Lord, that is, the Lord Chriſt as you may ſee by the coherence, every knee ſhall bow to me, willingly, or by compulſion. If it bend not willingly, I will make it bow, or break. Chriſt will be King though the earth be never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady, and the haters of the Lord ſhall be ſubject unto him. How? ſhall his haters be his Subjects? yes they ſhall be ſubject to him either one way or another. For though they be not ſubject to his grace, they ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his power. They that will not be ruled by him, ſhall be broken by him. We read of ſome that break his bonds aſunder, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2, 3. but preſently he breaks their bonds aſunder. If they be good at breaking,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46169:47"/>
Chriſt will fall a breaking too. He will break them with a rod of Iron, and daſh them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel. The authority of Chriſt, as it hath ſome that ſtoop to it, ſo it hath others that oppoſe it. And ſuch are they of whom we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.19. His Citizens hated him, &amp; ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage after him to tell him to his teeth we will not have this man to rule over us. They were in haſte, they could not tarry till he came about again, but they muſt ſend this ſawcy Meſſage after him. But ſee now what becomes of theſe men, and whether it be all as they will, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>But theſe my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that would not have me to rule over them, bring them forth and ſlay them before me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh think on this, you that will not be ruled by Jeſus Chriſt, who when his will is manifeſted to you, and when you are acquainted with the Laws and Statutes of his Kingdom, regard it not at all, but make light of all this. Oh, be adviſed to be wiſe and ſerve the Lord. Kiſs the ſon, he hath authority, and therefore do him fealty, leaſt he be angry and you periſh.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that all mankind is under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt? they are miſtaken then who think that ſome men are exempt from his authority and from his Legiſlative power, and that they are not bound to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Laws he gives. I am very apt to think that Infidels &amp; heathens who never had the Goſpel preached to them, who never heard of Jeſus Chriſt, are no way bound to the obedience of the Law of faith, ſo that they ſin in not believing in the Lord Chriſt, and taking him to be their Saviour whom they have no means to know. The Law of faith (I mean of juſtifying faith) the Commandment to believe, is not a natural, but a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law, and conſequently promulgation is abſolutely neceſſary to the obligation of it. But the Decalogue, the Moral Law, the Law of works, is written in the heart of man by nature, and therefore bindeth all men to obedience.</p>
               <p>Yea, but ſay ſome, believers are exempted from the obligation of it; the faithful are not bound to the obedience of the Moral Law. Its true I muſt confeſs they are not bound to the obedience of it ſo as to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſaved by this obedience. They are not bound to the obedience of it ſo as the condition of a Covenant of works. But they are bound to the obedience of it ſo as to teſtifie their faith and love, and thankfulneſs, and ſervice to the Lord Chriſt, who hath impoſed this Law upon all fleſh, ſo that all men, yea even believers, are under the commanding power of this Law.</p>
               <p>Yea, but it will be ſaid by ſome, that Jeſus Chriſt hath made us free,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label>
that he hath purchaſed liberty for all his members, which liberty they are commanded to maintain, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. And this they think, and teach to be even from the obligation of the Moral Law.</p>
               <p>True, Chriſt hath made us free indeed, but from the ſervitude of ſin,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
not from the ſervice of himſelf; and from the Law of ſin as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.23. not from his own Law. Why ſhould we think that Chriſt hath ſhed his blood to free his people from the obligation of his own Law? Indeed my Brethren, if the Moral Law, the Law of love, the Law of works, were not the Law of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:46169:48"/>
calls it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.2. I ſhould be eaſily perſwaded to believe his people are exempted from the binding power of it. It ſeemeth reaſonable that his members ſhould be freed from any Law but that which he himſelf gives. But the commandment of the Moral Law which is fulfilled in love, is his Commandment, <hi>John</hi> 15.12. ſtrengthened with his authority, delivered in his hand and name to men, and who can think that he ſhould not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his own Law, upon his own people? Mark that of the Evangeliſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74, 75. He hath ſaved us from our enemies and from the hands of all that hate us. that we might ſerve him who hath ſaved us, in holineſs to God, and in righteouſneſs to man; which is indeed the ſumm, and ſubſtance of the Moral Law. So that the liberty which Chriſt hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for his people, is liberty to keep, not liberty to break the Law; and that is liberty indeed, as <hi>David</hi> thinks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. <hi>I will run the wayes of thy Commadments, when thou haſt ſet my heart at liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſay it in a word my Brethren, there is a twofold liberty, a twofold freedom, the one enjoyed under ſin, and the other under Chriſt. Under ſin we are free to do any thing but good; under Chriſt we are free to do any thing but evil. Of the firſt ſort of freedom ſpeaks the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6.20. When you were the ſervants of ſin ye were free from righteouſneſs; and of the ſecond faith the ſame Apoſtle in <hi>ver.</hi> 22. of that Chapter, Being the ſervants of God ye are free from ſin. Well then our Saviour Chriſt hath brought us from the former to the latter ſort of freedom, ſo that we are at liberty from ſin, and not at liberty to ſin. We are at liberty to ſerve him, and obey him and to keep his Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> But it is objected further out of theſe words of the Apoſtle to the believing Romans, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. where he tells them ye are not under the Law, but under Grace. And if believers are not under it, why then how are they ſubject to the obligation of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sol.</note>To this I anſwer, that believers are not under it reſpectively to the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, for they willingly obey it. They are not under it reſpectively to the ſevere exaction of it, for they are delivered from it; it comes to them with Evangelical allay, and Goſpel mitigation. They are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it reſpectively to the malediction and the condemnation of it, for they are not accurſed, they ſhall not be condemned by it.</p>
               <p>But they are under the commanding and the binding power, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of it notwithſtanding, becauſe from this they are not neither can they be delivered. For if you look upon the ſubſtance of the Moral Law, it is an everlaſting, an eternal Law, as <hi>David</hi> calls it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. It ſheweth what is good, and what is evil in it ſelf, and in its nature. So that the things that are commanded there, are not good becauſe they are commanded, but are commanded becauſe they are good. And ſo the things that are forbidden, they are not evil becauſe they are forbidden, but are forbidden becauſe they are evil. And hence this Law is never charged (as the Law of the forbidden fruit, and as the Ceremonial, and Judaical Laws) no, it is ſtedfaſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word that was ſpoken by Angels, that is, the Moral Law that was delivered by their Miniſtry, is ſtedfaſt. Indeed this Law, the Law of nature, was written in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:46169:48"/>
and Chriſt intendeth not to blot out any thing that was engraven there, but promiſes to write it out again more fairly (for it was much obliterated by the fall) in the hearts of his people. So runs the tenor of the New Covenant, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.33.</p>
               <p>The laſt Objection that I ſhall inſiſt upon,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> is taken from thoſe words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>The Law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>is not given to the Righteous.</hi> And if it be not given to them, why then it ſeems that it belongs not to them any way.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer that the Apoſtles purpoſe is not that the righteous are not under the command and obligation of the Law; for mark it,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was exactly righteous, and yet it was a Law to him even in the ſtate of innocency it ſelf.</p>
               <p>But this is that which the Apoſtle means; the Law is not given to the righteous ſo as to force him to obedience, ſo as to be againſt a righteous man. It is not given for his hurt and condemnation. He doth not ſay <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Lex non eſt lata, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> Lex non eſt poſita;</hi> which inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates an action or a plea againſt a man. So that the Moral Law is not the action or the plea of God againſt a righteous man to bring him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judgement, and to oblige and bind him over to damnation. And ſo it is the ſame in ſenſe with that which is delivered by the ſame Apoſtle in another place, ſpeaking of ſuch as are guided by the ſpirit, and expreſs the fruits of it in their lives and converſations, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23. He doth not ſay to ſuch a one, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>againſt ſuch there is no Law.</hi> Indeed the Moral Law, ſo far as it is againſt believers, is not impoſed but removed by Chriſt. <hi>He hath blotted out the hand writing of Ordinances that was againſt us, that was contrary to us, and took it out of the way; nayling it to his Croſs, Col.</hi> 2.14 even the hand writing of Moral ordinances, ſo far as it is againſt us, and contrary to us, Chriſt hath taken out of the way. It is againſt us in the rigor; and in the curſe and malediction of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, ſo far it is taken off by Chriſt in relation to believers. But it is not againſt believers in the commands and precepts of it requiring them to love God and ſerve God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No, theſe things ſute with their ſpirits, they are written in their hearts, and therefore they are not deſtroyed, but rather ſtrengthened, and confirmed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that all mankind is under the authority of Ieſus Chriſt, under <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> his legiſlative power? Then certainly believers muſt not ſtoop to any other legiſlative power, to the prejudice of his. And this is that which the Apoſtle preſſeth hard on the <hi>Coloſsians, Col.</hi> 2.20. In the foregoing verſe he ſetteth forth the authority of Chriſt; and ſheweth that he is the head and ruler of his people, and preſently comes in with this Interrogation, <hi>and why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are you ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> by which he doth not mean the Laws of God, but the decrees, and conſtitutions and commands of men. And ſo himſelf explains it afterward in the ſucceeding words, that by thoſe Ordinances he intendeth nothing elſe but the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and doctrines of men. As if he ſhould have ſaid, if you be under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Why are you ſubject to the Ordinances and commands of men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then, doth the authority of Jeſus Chriſt,<label type="milestone">

from obedience to any ordinances, or commands of men? and are they to be ſubject to him ſo, that they be ſubject to no other governours or ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in the world? Is the authority and power of Magiſtrates diſſolved by this means?</p>
               <p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> To this I anſwer, No, by no means; and therefore you muſt know that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>be ye not ſervants of men,</hi> be ye not ſubject to the ordinances and commands of men: he doth not mean it abſolutely, as if we ought not to be ſubject to them any way. It was not his intention to bring in ſuch confuſion, and ſuch Anarchy into the world. For in another place he tells us, that we <hi>muſt needs he ſubject to the Magiſtrate, Rom.</hi> 13.5. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> Exhortation goes a little further, and is a little more large, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man, and that for the Lord ſake;</hi> And it is neceſſary that we ſhould do ſo, ſaith he; <hi>for ſo is the will of God, verſe</hi> 15. of that Chapter.</p>
               <p>Theſe two do ſeem apparently to contradict and claſh with one another. <hi>Be ye not the ſervants of men,</hi> and <hi>Ye muſt needs he ſubject to men;</hi> be ye not ſubject to the ordinances and commands of men, And yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every ordinance of man; and therefore I ſhall cleer it in a word, or two, both with relation to the outward man, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>For the outward man, that ought not to be ſubject to the Injunctions &amp; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> commands of men, where they croſs the law of Chriſt, there are ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of men that meddle only with ſuch things as are not comprehended in the Law of Chriſt, but are left by him indifferent, neither command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor forbidden. To ſuch as theſe we may and ought to yield obedience; there is no queſtion but the Lawfull Magiſtate hath power concerning things indifferent, to interdict them, or require them for Politick and civil ends, and in relation to the better government or profit, and emolument of thoſe who are ſubjected to his power. And however I am under the authority of Chriſt, I am not free in ſuch a caſe as this is.</p>
               <p>There are other Laws of men which concur with Chriſts Laws, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that which they command, forbidding that which they forbid; As when Chriſt forbids to ſwear, &amp; when the Magiſtrate forbids to ſwear too; when Chriſt forbids us to profane the Sabbath, and when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate forbids us to prophane it too; There is no ſcruple touching ſuch commands as theſe; for here the Magiſtrate and Chriſt do cloſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in obeying one of them, we obey the other too.</p>
               <p>But when the Laws of men do contradict the Laws of Chriſt, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that which they command, commanding that they forbid; when their Injunctions claſh with his, we ought not to ſubject our ſelves to them. The authority of Chriſt is the greateſt in the world: <hi>his Father</hi> (as you have it in my text) <hi>hath given him power over all fleſh.</hi> And therefore he muſt rather be obeyed then any fleſhly power, if once they come in competition, and if they cannot be obeyed together, in ſuch a caſe as this, my brethren, when the ſame thing ſhall come to be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law of Chriſt, forbidden in the Law of man, and ſo upon the other ſide, we have a certain rule to walk by, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. <hi>It is better to obey God then men,</hi> in ſuch a caſe we cannot be the ſervants of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46169:49"/>
if we be ſo, we cannot be the ſervants of Chriſt; for in obeying them, we throw off the authority of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as we ought not to ſubject our outward man to the commands of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> men in ſuch a caſe: ſo in the ſecond place we ought not to ſubject our Conſcience to the commands of men in any caſe. The Conſcience is the Lords peculiar, none h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th authority on that but he only. And therefore Chriſt condemns it in the Scribes and Phariſes, They taught for doctrines the commandments of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. They were but conſtitutions and commands of men, and yet they vented them for Doctrines, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them on the Conſcience; This they ought not to have done; or if they did ſo, they ought not to be yielded to in ſo doing. We ought not to be ſubject to the commands of men, upon ſuch terms as theſe are. The Lord complains of this in <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a grievous ſin, for which he thunders out a heavy doom againſt them, a Judgement ſo remarkable, that it ſhould come the next ſtep to a miracle, becauſe their fear to him was taught by the precepts of men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.

Well then ſince Chriſt hath ſuch authority upon us, let none of us ſubject our Conſcience and our faith to men; let them not be Lords of theſe, for they belong to Chriſt and him only. He ſuffers magiſtrates indeed to rule without, over the outward man, but he alone muſt rule within over the conſcience. If any go about to take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on that, or to give Law to that, <hi>you muſt ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made you free,</hi> as the Apoſtle counſels you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that all mankind is under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt? Then <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> let not one man cenſure and condemn another.

               <p>Why you will ſay, may not one man judge another without any dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation from the authority of Chriſt? yes, if he do it by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from Chriſt, and according to the rules preſcribed by Chriſt. So one man may judge another and condemn another too, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received power from Chriſt in the Church, and Common-wealth. But if one man judge another of himſelf, without any Lawfull pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and without any real ground, if one man judge another in or about ſuch things as are reſerved to the authority of Chriſt, as ſecret things and the final ſtate of men, and ſuch like, it is a prejudice to the authority of Chriſt and to the power which <hi>God hath given him over all fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet, how uſual is it with men to judge, and cenſure one another, when they are not called to it, when they have no right to do it, when they have no ſufficient ground for it? They
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46169:50"/>
will judge the hearts of men, they will judge the ends of men which are known to none but God, having neither evidence nor war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for theſe cenſures. If they be out with any man, preſently he is an Hypocrite, a rotten-hearted wretch, and what not? if he do any doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful action, they will be ſure to conſtrue it the worſt way; if he do any action clearly good, then he hath ill ends in it, nothing can ſcape their hard cenſures. Nay ſome will paſs their doom upon the final ſtate of men, which none but Chriſt himſelf can judge of. Now, I beſeech you, (my beloved) conſider whoſe authority you violate in this, and whoſe office you aſſume. Remember, Chriſt hath power over all fleſh; he is the Law-giver, who is able both to ſave and to deſtroy; who knows whom he will ſave, and whom he will deſtroy: let him judge all, and do not you judge one another.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> IS it ſo that all mankind is under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt? Then let them not avenge themſelves in any caſe, but let them have recourſe to Jeſus Chriſt for right, when any wrong or injury is done to them. Whoever doth it, he is under the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, he is within the verge &amp; compaſs of his Juriſdiction; his Father hath inveſted him with a power over all fleſh: ſo that let the wrong doer be of what condition, or eſtate, or place he will, let the wrong be what it will, it fals within his cognizance, and he can right it, if he pleaſe, and he will right it in his own time. Indeed, if there were none to ſeek unto when we are injured and abuſed, if there were none to do us juſtice, there were ſome colour then, why we ſhould avenge our ſelves. If there were none but the ſervants in a Family, (if ſuch a thing might be ſuppoſed) and there were no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Maſter over all, it could not be avoided, but they would brawl among themſelves; For every one in ſuch a caſe would look to be his own Judge, there being none ſuperior to him and his fellow to decide the quarrell. But when they have a Maſter to complain to, who hath power to take an order with any of them that offend, it were a great indignity to him and his authority for any of them to correct their fellow-ſervants. (Beloved) we have all one Maſter, we are all under the power and the authority of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore if our fellow-ſervants wrong us, let us not undertake to right our ſelves, but let us patiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our cauſe to him that judgeth righteouſly. I ſay (as the Apoſtle Romans, 12.19.) <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves.</hi> Take heed that you be neither overcome of evil in your paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Romans</hi> 12. ult. nor render evil for it in your actions, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.15. There are not many ſins to which we are ſo mightily inclined, as we are to this, nor which we are ſo hardly able to reſiſt. And truly I am much afraid, that in the proſecution of the great affairs of this time, there is in many too much of the private grudge, and ſelf-revenge, who make the publique cauſe a cover for their own malice. Now, I beſeech you, (my beloved) let us not ſtudy to avenge our ſelves on any man, but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46169:50"/>
let us lay aſide all ſelf-reſpects. If we have been abuſed and wronged by any, let us forgive them, and forbear them, (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts) Col. 3.13. <hi>Forgiving one another, and forbearing one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any.</hi> There is much in that Text: forgiving one another in regard of inward malice, and forbearing one another in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of outward revenge. And that not only in conceited and imaginary, but in true and real wrongs: For ſo the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> rendred <hi>quarrell</hi> or <hi>complaint</hi> imports: Not a quarrell pickt or raiſed upon no ground at all, but <hi>juſta conquerendi cauſa,</hi> (as <hi>Zanchius</hi> reads it) a juſt occaſion of complaint. So that when we are injured, ſo as the abuſe is evident and clear, it is our duty to forgive and to forbear: And that who ever offer the abuſe to us, let him be what he will, if any man have a quarrel againſt any, of what condition or degree ſoever, none exempted, yet we muſt forgive ſtill, and we muſt forbear ſtill.</p>
               <p>And this becauſe it hath a world of difficulties in it, I ſhall ſet on with a few Conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Conſider you entrench on Jeſus Chriſt, in ſelf-revenge, invade his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and peculiar right, you do that which belongs to him, which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high preſumption. And this the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intimates in his petition: Pſal. 94 1. <hi>O God to whom vengeance belongeth, O God to whom ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance belongeth, ſhew thy ſelf:</hi> he ſpeaks it there excluſively, vengeance belongs to him, and none but him: To none but him originally, primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, though he make over power to execute it, to his Deputies and Vicegerents: who though they cannot do it of themſelves, and by their own authority, yet they may do it as the Miniſters of Chriſt, (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, ſpeaking of the Magiſtrate) Rom. 13.4. <hi>He is the Miniſter of God,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and an avenger.</hi> A Miniſter of God, and by that means, by vertue of his deputation a revenger, to execute wrath on him that doth evil. So that when our abuſes are unſufferable, and when they wound the name, or the eſtate ſo deep that they are not to be born, if we go to the Magiſtrate to right us, and avenge us, we go to Jeſus Chriſt in him, becauſe he hath appointed him, and ſet him up for that purpoſe. But if we avenge our ſelves, we wreſt the ſword out of the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, and do as much as in us lies, to diſ-inveſt him of that power which God hath given him over all fleſh. And with this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſſwades them from ſelf-revenge in the fore-alledged Scripture, Rom. 12.19. <hi>Dearly beloved, avenge not your ſelves,</hi> and why ſo? becauſe in ſo doing, you enter on the right of Chriſt; <hi>for it is written, vengeance is mine,</hi> it is not yours, no, <hi>it is mine, and I will repay it,</hi> either by my ſelf, or by my ordinance.</p>
               <p>By ſelf-revenge, as you invade the right of Chriſt, ſo you ſtay and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt from taking vengeance for you on your enemies. You give not place to his wrath, (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19.) He would avenge you, and you would not ſuffer him, but you will do it with your own hands. He offers to ſtep in and right you, and you will not give him the place; no, you juſtle him aſide by a revengeful righting of your ſelves. And therefore it is juſt with him to leave you to your ſelves in this buſineſs: and truly this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46169:51"/>
among the reſt, may be the cauſe why many men lie under ſuch unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable wrongs; why they are ſo abuſed and oppreſſed without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; why Chriſt forbeareth to avenge them, becauſe they will not give him way; they will get into the ſeat, they will be medling with his office and authority, and therefore he ſtands by and looks on. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deſire that he that hath authority to right us, ſhould put to his own hand, let us acquit our hearts and hands (as much as it is poſſible) of ſelf-revenge. I ſay to every one of you, as <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Say not I will render evil, I will revenge;</hi> but wait on Chriſt, and he will ſave you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And thirdly, as by ſelf-revenge you give no place to Chriſt, ſo you give place to the Devil; you deny the place to Chriſt, and you let the Devil have it. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having diſſwaded us from wrath which tendeth to revenge, <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath,</hi> adds this immediately in the ſucceeding words, <hi>neither give place to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Eph. 4.27. And is not this a fearful thing to juſtle Ieſus Chriſt aſide, that we may let the Devil in? to make room for ſuch a gueſt as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is, and that by putting Jeſus Chriſt by? For it is Satan (my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) that makes ſuch work in mens hearts, and ſtirs them up to ſuch unwarrantable practices as theſe are.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Laſtly, By taking vengeance on our Brethren, we do exceedingly provoke Chriſt to take vengeance upon us. We take vengeance upon others, and all that we gain is this, we cauſe the Lord to take vengeance on our ſelves: we do not only hinder him from executing wrath for us, but we provoke him to execute his wrath upon us. <hi>Becauſe that</hi> Edom <hi>hath dealt againſt the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>(ſaith the Lord) by taking vengeance,</hi> what follows? <hi>I will take vengeance upon</hi> Edom, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 25.12. If Chriſt come in and find his family together by the ears, he will be in a rage too, and he will take an order with them altogether. <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and they together againſt <hi>Judah.</hi> And what is the event of theſe contentions? why the Lord is againſt them all. <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſtill:</hi> Iſa. 9.21. He deals with us, (my Brethren) as we deal with others: <hi>with the froward</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward,</hi> Pſal. 18.25. If we be unjuſtly froward to our Brethren, he will be juſtly froward toward us: If we lay on upon our brethren, he will lay on upon us.</p>
               <p>Let theſe conſiderations keep us from revenge: And becauſe it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard thing to forbear, eſpecially when opportunities are put into our hands; <hi>For if a man find his Enemy at an advantage, will he let him go free?</hi> 1 Sam. 24.20. I ſhall give you two directons which will be very helpful to you, to cauſe you to abſtain from ſelf-revenge: Firſt, you muſt put away thoſe carnal Luſts: and in the next place you muſt put away thoſe carnal reaſons, which incline you to revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> You muſt put away thoſe carnal luſts, which incline you to revenge: you muſt ſubdue and mortifie them to the utmoſt of your power; Theſe are the true real cauſes of it, they are within, and not without you. <hi>Whereas there is ſtrife among you,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians) are you not carnal?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.3. Is it not very manifeſt that there is much corruption, much fleſh in you? It may be you may think it to be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46169:51"/>
otherwiſe; but mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, Jam. 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you?</hi> whence is it, that it is but a word and a blow? an injury and a revenge? whence is it? why hence it is, will ſome men ſay; I am ſo troubled and moleſted, I am ſo wronged and abuſed, that I cannot ſuffer it: No, no, (ſaith the Apoſtle) thou art very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; it is thy pride, ſelf-love, envy, paſſion, that are the true and real cauſes why thou canſt not hold thy hands: <hi>from whence come wars and fightings among you? even from your luſts;</hi> If there were no wars within, there would be no wars without. If theſe corruptions and unruly luſts within were throughly mortified and ſubdued, theſe outward provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would never cauſe ſuch hot contentions as they do.</p>
               <p>You muſt put away thoſe carnal reaſonings that incline you and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you to revenge: For theſe, if you will give them entertainment, will ſet your hearts on fire of hell. And therefore you muſt do as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, when there was like to be ſome difference between him and his Nephew <hi>Lot:</hi> Its probable he was aſſaulted with ſuch thoughts as theſe; What wilt thou yield and ſtoop to him? it is his duty to ſubmit to thee; ſhall <hi>Lot</hi> thy Nephew have his choice of all the Land, and thou his aged Unkle be content to take the boyes leavings? But <hi>Abraham</hi> hearkens not to ſuch ſuggeſtions. So <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he was contemned, vilified, and ſet at nought, no doubt he had his paſſions in him, though he were a meek man, and they were apt enough to work, and ſtir, and ſecretly to egg him on to this or the like purpoſe, What, wilt thou ſuffer ſuch a groſs abuſe? ſhall they go ſmooth away with ſuch a bold affront, and baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, as this is? No, let them know that they have miſ-behaved themſelves towards their betters: But <hi>Moſes</hi> patiently allays and ſtils ſuch thoughts as theſe, and meekly puts up all without diſtemper. I might exemplifie in <hi>David,</hi> when he was abuſed by <hi>Shimei,</hi> who was his Subject, and that in ſuch a baſe, unworthy, and unſufferable way: no doubt he had his inward riſings, and he had one at hand that was an end to take revenge for him: and yet he calms all, we hear no more but this, <hi>Let him curſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So when our thoughts begin to work apace in any injury or provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is offered to us, and to tell us ſtrange things, let us ſmother and ſuppreſs them: let us conſider that, and think on that which may provoke to love, and not to malice and revenge.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that all mankind is under the authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then ſurely we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>6</label> have all great reaſon to comply with him, and to endeavour what we can to pleaſe him to the utmoſt of our power. You know it is the faſhion of the world, to do what they are able to keep in with thoſe who are in place, and under whoſe authority and power they are: How will they bend, and ſtoop, and yield, and bring themſelves to any thing almoſt to pleaſe ſuch men! beloved, we are all under the power of Jeſus Chriſt, under his Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, and under his judiciary power: He gives us Law now, &amp; he will paſs ſentence on us according to his Law hereafter, if we be diſobedient and rebellious; and therefore we have reaſon to keep in with him, <hi>to kiſs the Son,</hi> to do him homage, <hi>leſt he be angry, and we periſh. We labour,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that whether preſent or abſent, we may be accepted of him.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For we muſt all appear before the judgement-ſeat
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46169:52"/>
of Chriſt,</hi> as it is added in the next words, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>The time is coming when he is to ſit upon us, and to judge us, and to diſpoſe of us for ever, either in heaven, or in hell; and therefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us infinitely to pleaſe him in the mean time, that he may be propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us when that time comes. We pitty ſuch a malefactor, who being ſhortly to be tried before an earthly Judge, upon a point of life or death, doth rather take a courſe to anger and provoke him, then appeaſe him; and yet ſo deſperately fooliſh are a multitude of men, who ſtrive not to approve themſelves to Chriſt, nor to be accepted of him, before whoſe judgment-ſeat they muſt appear to be acquitted or condemned: And ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his doom, to live or die, and that for ever.</p>
               <p>Oh but think upon that laſt and dreadful day, remember at whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy you muſt ſtand, and ſo endeavour to demean your ſelves, that whether you be preſent in the body, or whether you be abſent from the body, that both in life, and death, and judgement, you may be accepted of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>7</label> Is it ſo that all mankind is under the Judiciary power of Chriſt? that he hath power to paſs the ſentence, and to execute the ſentence on them? this ſerveth then for matchleſs terrour to the wicked, and for incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable comfort to the godly; a word or two to each of theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> How can the thought of this but ſtrike amazement and aſtoniſhment to the hearts of wicked men! What mercy can they look for at his hands whom have they peirced through, whoſe grace they deſpiſed, whoſe Law and Goſpel they have diſobeyed, whoſe Spirit they have grieved, and deſpighted, whoſe blood they have trodd upon? Oh what a fearful thing it is that they ſhould be in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, that he and none but he ſhould judge them. Did <hi>John</hi> fall down at the preſence of an angel? did <hi>Faelix</hi> tremble before <hi>Paul,</hi> when he did but diſcourſe of Judgement? Did the Officers and Souldiers of the Jews fall back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the voyce of Chriſt? and that while he was in a ſtate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of abaſure?

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And how can this but infinitely cheer the Saints to think, that they are in the power of Jeſus Chriſt, who is their Brother, their Mediator, their Redeemer; that he who ſhed his blood for them, and none but he, ſhall judge them too! How will they lift up their heads to ſee him comming with the clouds to judge the world?

Aſſuredly my brethren, he that <hi>hath power over all fleſh,</hi> will never hate and deſtroy his own fleſh, nor condemn his own members. No it is well for them that this power is in Chriſts hands: for now they may be confident that he will ſave them, that he will give eternal life to

them. And thus far of the firſt particular conſidered in the words, the thing it ſelf with which our Saviour is inveſted and endued, and this you ſee, <hi>is power over all fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, The means by which he comes to be inveſted with it, <hi>viz</hi> by free donation from his Father. He hath this power, becauſe his Father gave it him; <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as thou haſt given.</hi> He ſaith not, As thy Son hath taken power over all fleſh, as he hath entred on it, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed it to himſelf; But as thou haſt inveſted and endued him with it. By which he ſhews apparently, that he comes to it by his fathers act, and by his Fathers guift, and not by his own intruſion, <hi>as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that hence I might obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt did not intrude himſelf on the authority with which he is inveſted over all fleſh, but was admitted to it freely by his Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He did not take this honour to himſelf, as the expreſſion is, though in another caſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4. but it was put upon him. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.6. Note 3. But this I do but point at in my paſſage by.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to the third and laſt Particular conſidered in the words, <hi>viz.</hi> the end for which he is inveſted with this vaſt authority. <hi>That he may give eternal life to as many as God hath given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee, (my Brethren) here is giving upon all hands: The Father gives the Son, that the Son may give to others: The Father gives to him power, that he may give to others life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Let us look upon this end in general, before we take it into parts. And here let us conſider, whether this be the only end for which the Father gives the Son power; whether he have no other aim in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this authority upon him over all fleſh; but only that he may beſtow eternal life upon his own people; what need he have ſo large authority for this end? Authority over all fleſh, that he may give eternal life to ſome fleſh, to the leaſt part of fleſh, to as many as God hath given him, who are comparatively but a ſmall number. What uſe hath this autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in reference to other fleſh, to whom he doth not give eternal life, if this be all the end of it?</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, (my Brethren) you muſt know that this is not the only end, but it is the chief end; for it is very manifeſt in Scripture, that the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, as it extends to all fleſh, ſo it is exerciſed one way or another upon all fleſh. It is beſtowed upon him by his Father, as well that he may give eternal death to ſome, as eternal life to others. And ſo accordingly he executes this power, and this authority of his, as well in paſſing ſentence of condemnation upon unbelievers, as of ſalvation upon believers. In judging ſome (and that the moſt of men) to death, as well as other ſome to life. <hi>The Father</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>hath committed all judgment to the Son:</hi> judgement as well of condemnation, as of abſolution. So that the giving of eternal life to as many as God hath given him, is not the only end of the authority of Ieſus Chriſt: but it is the main end, the prime end, the chief end. This end is principally in the eye of God, and Chriſt; the other end is not conſiderable in regard of this. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:46169:53"/>
that is not ſo much as hinted at, you ſee; but this is clearly and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mentioned. As who ſhould ſay, This was the end indeed, for which <hi>his Father gave him power over all fleſh;</hi> this was the thing he chiefly aimed at, <hi>that he might give eternal life to as many as God had given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the Point to be obſerved, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, with which he is inveſted over all fleſh, is chiefly for the benefit and the ſalvation of his own People.</head>
                  <p>It hath another end indeed, but this is the great end; he hath it not ſo much for the hurt of wicked men and unbelievers, as for the good of his Members. Not ſo much to deſtroy them, as to ſave theſe. And hence his Father who gave him this authority, gave him ſuch a name withall, as ſhews us why he took upon him this authority as man: why he became a Prieſt, a Prophet and a King, as you may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. Saith the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel there to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſpeaking of the Virgin <hi>Mary, She ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus:</hi> And why ſo? to ſhew the end for which he came into the world, <hi>for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Not ſo much to deſtroy ungodly men, as to ſave his own people: In which reſpect his Father would not have him called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>a Deſtroyer</hi> (the name impoſed upon the King of Locuſts mentioned <hi>Apoc.</hi> 9.11. though he be ſo to many men, yea to the greateſt part of men, whom he will puniſh with everlaſting deſtruction; But Jeſus, a Saviour: its true indeed that Chriſt is ſet (as that is the Expreſſion, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34.) <hi>that he is appointed by his Father for the fall and riſing again of many in Iſrael:</hi> as for the riſing of believers, ſo for the fall of unbelievers. But this is but by accident, and beſides the main intention either of God in ſending, or of Chriſt in coming. He doth not cauſe the fall of ſuch as periſh direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he doth the raiſing of ſuch as are ſaved by him. And this is not obſcurely mentioned in that place which is parallel to this, Iſa. 8.14. <hi>He ſhall be for a Sanctuary,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet there) that is the main end which he ſerveth for, to be a place of refuge to his people: and therefore that which follows is added with a But, as coming in upon the by, beſides his purpoſe. <hi>He ſhall be for a Sanctuary, but for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to the houſe of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>and many among them ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and be broken.</hi> Though he be in himſelf a Sanctuary, yet this ſhall be the iſſue and event to ſome men: Indeed <hi>he came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) not to deſtroy Sinners. Its true that Sinners are deſtroyed by him, but this was not the end of his coming. <hi>God did not ſend his Son into the world,</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) Ioh. 3.17. <hi>to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo our Saviour (Chriſt himſelf profeſſeth, John 12.47. <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> And therefore if you look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſtory, you ſhall find that he was frequently employed in works of mercy, of helping, and of ſaving people every way; but when his hot Diſciples would have the Samaritans deſtroyed by fire from heaven, you

know he would not hear of it. You ſhall obſerve that he abſolved and acquitted many in the dayes of his fleſh, <hi>Be of good cheer, your ſins are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> But whom did he condemn, or whoſe ſins did he bind upon him? No not the woman that was taken in adultery, yea in the very act, to ſhew how much this was beſides his purpoſe. And therefore when he delegated his Authority to his Apoſtles, you may ſee the drift of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. It was to bring in his Elect to him, that they might be ſaved by him, having told them <hi>that all power was given to him both in heaven and in Earth.</hi> Immediately by vertue of that power, he gives them their Commiſſion, that they ſhould go preach the Goſpel, and convert men to the faith, and baptize them in his name. He doth not ſay to them, as God doth to the Prophet, Ier. 1.10. <hi>I have ſet you over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to deſtroy:</hi> but I have ſent you to the Nations, to teach them, and to ſave them, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the point you ſee is fully proved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with which he is inveſted over all fleſh, is chiefly for the benefit and the ſalvation of his own people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it muſt needs be ſo, as I ſhall make it evidently and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively to appear to you; For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, His very Mediatorſhip is chiefly for the benefit and ſalvation of his <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> people, and therefore the authority which he enjoys, and which he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with as man and Mediator, muſt needs be for the ſame End: why was the Son of God incarnate, why was he made the Mediator? not for the hurt of wicked men, but for the good of his choſen; Not to bring them out, or to keep them out, but to bring theſe in: not to make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or war for them, but to make amity and peace for theſe. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently his authority muſt have the ſame aim. He took our nature on him, he took upon him to be the Mediator between God and man: and ſo accordingly aſſumed the Oeconomical, and the diſpenſatory Kingdom too, and the authority whereof we ſpeak, for the ſake of his people. He had not been a Mediator, he had not been a King as man, but for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. They are the end of his Kingdom and of his power; and hence the Execution of it is carried wholly and throughout with relation to the Saints All the authority he exerciſes is for them, and all the judgements that he executeth are for them. That which he doth as King, and as a Iudge, againſt the world, is for them: If he rebuke the great ones of the world, it is for them, (as you may ſee, Pſal. 105.10. <hi>He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved Kings for their ſakes:</hi> and therefore he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the King of Saints,</hi> Apoc 15.3. True, he is King of all the world, his power is over all fleſh, but this Authority of his relates eſpecially to his people. He is peculiarly the King of Saints: yea when he walks in ways of wrath, and judgement, and revenge towards his Churches Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he doth this as the King of Saints, with relation to the Saints.

ſaid, Juſt and true are thy wayes, O Lord Ieſus, O Lord Chriſt, O <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel,</hi> or the like. But they make choice of this Expreſſion, <hi>juſt and true are thy wayes, O thou King of Saints.</hi> To intimate that he did execute thoſe judgments upon Antichriſt, and his Adherents, not as King of the world ſo much, but as the King of his people; and for the better government, the greater eaſe, and peace, and quiet of his people. His aim was not ſo much at the deſtruction of his Enemies, as at the relaxation of his Church. He did it not ſo much out of hatred to the wicked, as out of love to his people. I deerly love my Saints, whoſe King I am; and they are not to be preſerved in tranquillity, and peace, they will be always vexed, and troubled, and diiſturbed, unleſs I take this rigid courſe with ſuch incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible wretches as theſe are.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The authority of Ieſus Chriſt, with, &amp;c. muſt needs be chiefly for the ſalvation of his own people, and not ſo much for the deſtruction of the wicked, becauſe the wicked might have been deſtroyed, though he had never been inveſted with this authority as man, but his own people could not have been ſaved. The reprobate would certainly have gone to hell, though all mankind had not been under the authority of Chriſt as Man and Mediator, but under the authority of God only. But the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and choſen had not gone to heaven. It could not have been ſo, but I make the ſuppoſition, if it had been ſo: So that his Father need not to have given him this power, that wicked wretches might be puniſhed with Eternal death; that would have been done of courſe: but that his own might have Eternal Life, which they could not have had without Chriſt. That other End had freely been accompliſhed and attained if Chriſt had never been incarnate; if he had never been inveſted with this power as man, the wicked had been damned. But it was abſolutely neceſſary to this end, that the Godly might be ſaved, that their Head and Mediator ſhould have power to give Eternal life to them. All the world had been deſtroyed, they had been plunged in Eternal death, if Chriſt had not been thus authorized to deliver his, and ſave his. And therefore this authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is put upon him by his Father, that ſome might have Eternal life; <hi>that he might give eternal life to as many believe in him.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The authority of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt needs be chiefly for the good and the ſalvation of his own people, and not ſo much for the deſtruction of the world, becauſe he is inveſted with it by his Father, out of love to mankind; and that which is done in Love, muſt needs be for a good end. God did not ſend his ſon into the world, and put ſuch power upon him, out of hatred to it, but out of pitty and compaſſion to his own choſen; <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his own ſon,</hi> John 3.16. he did it out of much love, and the End is anſwerable, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have life everlaſting;</hi> (as it is added in the next words) This is annexed you ſee that ſuits with love: whereas if he had done it that unbelievers might be ruined and deſtroyed, if that had been his main intention, it had proceeded from another principle, a principle of wrath and anger. But this he diſavows in the ſucceeding verſe, <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved.</hi> And that God did not ſend his Son, and give him power over all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:46169:54"/>
fleſh out of hatred and diſpleaſure, but out of favour and good will, and ſo by conſequence, his aim muſt be eſpecially and chiefly at the good of his people.</p>
                  <p>The authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt needs be chiefly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he exerciſeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this authority ſo long, and but ſo long as they have any good to reap by it, and when it is no further uſeful to his people, he in ſome ſenſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns it up to him from whom he had it. And therefore certainly it is for them and their profit. As long as there is an Enemy to hinder the good, and comfort, and ſalvation of his people, either within them, or without them, he keeps this power in his hands to curb them, and to keep them down. And ſo as the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>He muſt reign, till all thoſe enemies be under foot,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.25. till they be utterly ſubdued. And then when this is done, when there is none to trouble, or moleſt his people any longer, when he hath paſt the ſentence of eternal condemnation on the wicked, and ſent them packing unto hell, and ſeemed to ſay unto his Saints, Theſe Enemies which you have ſeen to day, you ſhall ſee them again no more for ever; when he hath caſt out every thing that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that is offenſive to his people, and made an everlaſting ſeparation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wicked and the godly: when he hath <hi>caſt the wicked into the Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone which is the ſecond death;</hi> and given eternal life to all his people: when he hath done them all the good that they are capable of, and when there is no further uſe of his authority for their advantage, he even yields it up to him that gave him power over all fleſh 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. By which it is apparent, that he took this power upon him principally for his peoples ſake.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is chiefly for the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> benefit and the ſalvation of his people? This then may be one great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement among the reſt, to all his people, to ſtoop to this authority of his, and to yield obedience to it. If it were managed to their hurt and diſadvantage, they had reaſon to avoid it, and to decline ſubmiſsion to it to the utmoſt of their power. Who would be under ſuch authority as aims at nothing elſe but the undoing of the Subject? But ſince the end of the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, is the good of his people, they have great reaſon to ſubmit to it. Ah, (my beloved) how ſhould this ſweeten the authority of Chriſt, and make it amiable, and deſirable, and pleaſing to his Subjects? How ſhould the Children of <hi>Zion</hi> be joyful in their King, (as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.2. how ſhould the members of the Church triumph and be exceeding glad that they are ſo well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded! that they have Jeſus Chriſt to be their Soveraign! that they have ſuch a Governour as he, who manages his whole authority for their profit and advantage! This is a joyful thing indeed, <hi>The Lord reigneth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.1. and what doth he inferr upon it? <hi>Let the Earth rejoyce, let the multitudes of the Iſles be glad of it.</hi> And truly we that are the people of the Lord of this Iſle, (as well as other Iſles and quarters of the world) have reaſon to be glad of this, that Chriſt rules, and that we are his Subjects. We are afraid continually of new ſtorms, and new troubles, but here is our comfort in the midſt of all this, that the rains of government are in the hands of Jeſus Chriſt, who is a King for our ſake,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:46169:55"/>
who is inveſted by his Father with authority, yea with ſupreme authority, ſuch as none can overtop, for our good, and for our ſafety. We may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Prophets ſpeech, Iſa. 33.20. <hi>Look upon</hi> Zion, <hi>the City of our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities: thine eyes ſhall ſee</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that ſhall not be taken down; not one of the ſtakes thereof ſhall ever be removed, neither ſhall any of the cords thereof be broken: But the glorious Lord will be to us a place of broad rivers.</hi> And why ſo; <hi>For the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver; the Lord is our King, and he will ſave us.</hi> So that however we be rent and torn with ſad diviſions, however we be ſhaken with continual fears; yet when we look to Jeſus, and conſider, Is not he out Law-giver, and is not he our Judge? is not the ſupreme authority in his hand? we may conclude that he will ſave us, that he will do us good, and that becauſe he hath received his power and his authority for this End.</p>

As God hath ſent the Son, ſo Jeſus Chriſt hath ſent his Miniſters and his Embaſſadors. It is his own expreſſion to his own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, John 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo I ſend you.</hi> And as God hath given power to Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, ſo Jeſus Chriſt hath given power to his Embaſſadors whom he hath ſent. And therefore it is added preſently in the fore-alledged Scripture, <hi>whoſeſoever ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, they be remitted, and whoſeſoever ſins, ye retain, they are retained.</hi> You muſt conceive it either in the preaching of the word, or elſe in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the cenſures of the Church. And this is that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals the power which Chriſt hath given him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10.</p>
               <p>Now all that have this power from Jeſus Chriſt, are here directed how to manage it, and what uſe to make of it. It is apparent they muſt uſe it to the very ſame end, to which Chriſt doth uſe his; For even as Chriſt hath his Commiſſion from the Father, ſo they have their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Chriſt. And even as Chriſt hath his authority from the Father, ſo they have their authority from Chriſt. And therefore even as the authority of Chriſt is managed chiefly for the good, and the ſalvation of his people, ſo muſt they manage theirs too for the very ſame end; they muſt not aim at the deſtruction, or the hardning of the people, they muſt not preach the Goſpel to them for ſuch purpoſes as theſe; though this by accident, be the effect ſometimes. No, they muſt make this their buſineſs, how they may ſave themſelves, and them that hear them, how they may bring about the converſion and ſalvation of the people, how they may draw in ſouls to Ieſus Chriſt, and make proſelytes for heaven; this ought to be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:46169:55"/>
the great thing which they aim at. It is true, they muſt be ſons of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der now and then, as well as ſons of conſolation: They muſt preach the Law ſometimes, as well as the ſweet comforts of the Goſpel: They muſt threaten men ſometimes with wrath, and hell, and eternal condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But then they muſt do it ſo as wiſhing that theſe things might might not come upon them, but rather that they might avoid them: They muſt threaten them with wrath, that they may fly from the wrath to come: and they muſt threaten them with hell, that they may eſcape the damnation of hell: They muſt preach the Law to them with Goſpel-purpoſes and Evangelical intentions: They muſt ſend out the avenger of blood to dog them at the heels, that they may fly to the city of refuge: They muſt uſe ſharpneſs, now and then; it cannot be avoided: But it muſt be for the ſame end which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the fore-alledged place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. where he mindeth the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that in caſe <hi>he muſt uſe ſharpneſs according to the power the Lord hath given him,</hi> he hath authority from Chriſt to do it; but mark in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding words to what end, to edification, and not to deſtruction: <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is very notable, that when our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth,</hi> and having put a part of this autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ity and power of his on his Apoſtles, he doth not bid them to go out and preach damnation to the people, <hi>but go and preach the Goſpel to them, and baptize them that they way be ſaved:</hi> And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the execution of this power in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the cenſures of the Church, ſaith, he would give a foul of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender up to Satan, for no other end then this, even for his good and his ſalvation, 1 Cor. 5.3, 4. <hi>I have already judged</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concerning him that hath ſo done this deed, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver him to Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi> (the carnal part) <hi>that the ſpirit might be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that when we threaten judgement, when we retain the ſins of men, when we give them up to Satan, either in preaching, or in Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, when we ſay of any perſon, Take him Satan, our aim muſt be that Chriſt may have him, that his corruption may be mortified, and that he may be ſaved by this means. And therefore let the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt have this continually in their eye, how they may reach this great end. Let all his under-officers in the adminiſtration of the power which Chriſt hath put upon them drive at that, for which Chriſt received his, that they may bring his people to eternal life, as you have it in my Text.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is chiefly <label type="milestone">

When he deſtroyes his Churches enemies, when he conſumes them that they may not be, (as this he doth ſometimes by vertue of this power which God hath put into his hands, and we have ſeen it in theſe latter days) let us conſider that he doth not this ſo much for their hurt, as for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:46169:56"/>
the good of his people. That his aim is not ſo much at the deſtruction of the one, as at the preſervation of the other. When he is laying on upon them with his keen and glittering ſword, let this be our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Now Chriſt is doing ſomething for his poor people.</p>
               <p>And this the Saints of old have done; And therefore <hi>David,</hi> or whoever elſe it be, that is the author of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. recording many judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lords which he had brought upon the Churches enemies, makes this the running verſe between continually, <hi>For his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever. He ſmote all the firſt born of Aegypt, For his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever. He overturned</hi> Pharoah <hi>and his Hoſt in the red Sea, For,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſmote great Kings and ſlew famous Kings, as</hi> Sihon <hi>King of the</hi> Amorites <hi>and</hi> Og, &amp;c. <hi>For his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> A man would think he ſhould have rather ſaid, he did ſuch things as theſe, becauſe his anger and his wrath endures for ever. What mercy was it for the Lord to ſlay Kings and to deſtroy Nations? truely it was none to them that were deſtroyed, but it was ſweet and precious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to them for whom they were deſtroyed. And Chriſt would have it known that in the execution of his vengeance on the wicked, he hath not an aſpect ſo much upon the miſery he brings the wicked to; no, his thoughts are taken up with the mercy and the love he manifeſts to his people; And when he layes about him, and ſlaſhes down the enemies in heaps, he ſeemeth to forget the hatred that he bears to them, and to think of nothing elſe but mercy, mercy to his Saints, <hi>Thus I kill them and deſtroy them, becauſe my mercy,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore let us learn to look upon it ſo, to have ſuch thoughts and apprehenſions upon ſuch occaſions.</p>
               <p>And that the rather, becauſe there is an inconveniency in it many times, when we behold Chriſt in another way. We look upon the Judgements which he wreaks and executes upon the Enemies and perſecuters of the Church, as if he brought them on them out of ſuch a hatred to them, as we our ſelves are apt to have. And ſo our hearts are carried out in wayes of malice, and we make Chriſt upon the matter, but the inſtrument of our revenge. Whereas if we did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him as aiming not ſo much at the deſtruction and ruine of the wicked, as at the good and preſervation of his people, and as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of his power which he ſees neceſſary for the peace, and welfare of the Saints, our hearts would be in a more ſweet and holy temper, then they are ſometimes in ſuch caſes. For then my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ſhould ſee the Love of Chriſt in all theſe diſpenſations of his wrath: the more his anger is declared at any time againſt the wicked, the more we ſhould be taken up with thoughts and apprehenſions of his love to us. The greater fury and diſpleaſure he reveals againſt them, the more we ſhould be led to contemplation of his mercy to our ſelves. Oh, what are we that he ſhould have ſuch dear reſpects to us? That he ſhould be ſo angry with poor creatures, and execute ſuch heavy judgements on them for our ſakes.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:46169:56"/>
they periſh, to have better thoughts of Chriſt, and milder apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions then they have. For you muſt know, my brethren, that Chriſt hath many Enemies; there are abundance in the world that hate him whoſe very hearts do riſe againſt him. And whence is this, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look upon him as one that aims at their deſtruction, as one that means to have their blood, to ruine them, and damn them in the pit of hell for ever. Now I beſeech you, my beloved, do not ſo miſtake your ſelves; think not ſo hardly of the Lord Chriſt. Believe it, Jeſus Chriſt hath other purpoſes then theſe, whatever you conceive of him; he came not to judge the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved. <hi>He came not to deſtroy you, but to ſave his own people.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you be deſtroyed, thank your ſelves, and not him. Your help if you have any, is of him; but your deſtruction is of your ſelves.</p>
               <p>Do but conſider, I beſeech you, what Chriſt hath done, what means he hath afforded you for your ſalvation. He hath aſſumed your nature who are reprobates, as well as yours who are elect. <hi>He hath laid down a price of worth ſufficient in it ſelf for your ſalvation,</hi> ſo that there is not one of you excluded from it, becauſe it will not reach to you as well as others, becauſe it is too narrow and too ſcant to ſatisfie for all, if all ſhould apprehend it, and lay hold upon it. No, he hath ordered mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo, that there is enough put in, not for believers only, but for them that periſh too. And that which is put in, as it is ſufficient for you, ſo it is applicable to you as well as others. As it was paid in your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo any of your nature may partake it, if they will lay hold upon it. It is a ſatisfaction which nothing but your unbelief and your refuſal can make you uncapable of. And hence the Lord will have a tender of it to be made, the Goſpel to be preached to you as well as others; ſo runs the tenour of his own Commiſſion, <hi>Go, preach the Goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> Tell every man without exception, that there is good news for him, that Chriſt is dead for him if he embrace him. Yea Chriſt himſelf doth by his Meſſengers perſwade, you, yea intreat you, and beſeech you to accept him. Yea, more then ſo, he works upon you by ſome kind of operation of his Spirit, and you reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt. He waits upon you many dayes, yea many years, even till his <hi>head be full of dew, and his locks wet with the drops of the night, he exercizeth much long-ſuffering to you, he is patient, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> All this he doth; and doth this look as if it were his aim to damn you, as if he ſought your ruine and deſtruction? It's true indeed you are by accident in the worſe caſe for Chriſt; you will have one day cauſe to wiſh (if you continue in your unbelief) that Chriſt had never been Incarnate, that you had never heard of him. But I beſeech you, whoſe fault is all this? is it Chriſts, or is it yours? you had been damned if Chriſt had never come; and when he came, he came to you as well as others. And he came not to deſtroy you, he came not to condemn the world (alas that was not his intention) but that the world by him might be ſaved. And therefore I beſeech you, do not thinks amiſs of Chriſt in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. If he ſhould condemn you, yet do not you condemn him, as if your
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:46169:57"/>
condemnation were the thing he looked for. If you will periſh, think not the worſe of Jeſus Chriſt, but juſtifie him, and applaud his mercy when you are ſinking into hell. Give teſtimony to the truth, and ſay, he hath done much to ſave me, but he hath done nothing to damn me. He came into the world to ſave ſinners; that was indeed the end of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I, by my rebellion, and my obſtinacy, and my unbelief, have made him do that which he came not for, even to deſtroy me. It was not Jeſus Chriſt; no, it was my own perverſneſs and incredulity, that hath undone me, and everlaſtingly, and brought me to this place of torment.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>5</label> Is it ſo, that the authority, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is chiefly for the good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they ſhall be ſaved, they may rely and reſt upon it as an unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable thing. Chriſt hath received his power and his authority for this end, his Father hath beſtowed it on him for this end, that he may give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many as God hath given him; and certainly they will not both be diſappointed of their main intention; They will not be croſſed in that which is their great deſign. Its true, the carrying on, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of the work of our ſalvation is a very hard buſineſs, it meets with many difficulties, and with many oppoſitions. But Chriſt you ſee is abſolutely and compleatly furniſhed to go through with it, and to ſave us to the utmoſt. If he were only veſted with authority and power over the fleſh which he intends to ſave, it would fall ſhort in this buſineſs: For there is other fleſh that would reſiſt, and hinder their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. There is fleſh within them, and there is fleſh without them, that would oppoſe this great work. The people of the Lord Chriſt have all of them much fleſh, and much corruption in them. And there is much fleſh without them, a multitude of wicked and ungodly men. And both of theſe, this fleſh within them, and this fleſh without them, are mighty obſtacles, and great impediments to the great end propounded in my text, the giving of eternal life to them. The fleſh without them, I mean the world and worldly men will ſeek to terrifie them, or allure them, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them from the waies of God, and will deceive, <hi>if it were poſsible, the very Elect.</hi> The fleſh within them will cloſe with that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out on all occaſions, and labour to withdraw them from the living God. So that, as I have ſaid, if Chriſt were only veſted with authority and power over the fleſh which he intends to ſave, it would fall ſhort in this buſineſs. But God you ſee hath given him power over all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eſh, <hi>that he may give eternal life to as many as he hath given him.</hi> Not only power over the fleſh to which he means to give eternal life, but power over all fleſh, that he may give eternal life to them. That other fleſh may not reſiſt and hinder him in this buſineſs. And therefore let us chear and comfort up our hearts in ſweet aſſurance of ſalvation, as many of us as belong to Chriſt. We are diſcouraged now and then perhaps when we perceive how ſtrong the fleſh within us is, how mighty and how violent, and how prevailing our corruptions are. We are afraid the wicked world, the fleſh without us, will overcome us in the end; either by honours and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or elſe by threats and perſecutions, and ſo will hazard our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But here's our never failing comfort, <hi>Chriſt hath power over all fleſh, that he may give us eternal life.</hi> He hath power over the fleſh within us, he
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:46169:57"/>
can ſubdue and maſter our corruptions when he pleaſes, he can pluck down thoſe ſtrong holds. He hath power over the fleſh without us, he can overcome the world, yea he hath overcome the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be of good chear, let us be confident we ſhall have eternal life at laſt; for God hath given him full power to this end, and to this purpoſe, that he may give it, and that none may hinder it.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is chiefly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>6</label> Oh, how much are we bound to God and Chriſt? to God the Father, that he hath given? to God the Son, that he hath taken this authority for this End? That both of them have been ſo careful, that the authority of Chriſt might be ſufficient to go through with the buſineſs, and all this for our ſakes. Oh, what are we that God and Chriſt ſhould have ſuch dear reſpect unto us, that they ſhould honour us ſo far, that our ſalvation ſhould be the end of the authority of Jeſus Chriſt! It is but fit that we ſhould be for him; that all that we are, or have, ſhould be for Chriſt. But that all that Jeſus Chriſt as Man and Mediator hath, ſhould be for us; that all his power and his authority over the world ſhould be for us; that we and our eternal happineſs ſhould be the end, as it is made in this place; and Jeſus Chriſt, and his authority in this reſpect ſhould be but a means to this end; this is a mercy and an honour, which we cannot reach to ſee the bottom of it any way. And that we ſhould have the preferment here, that the authority which Chriſt hath over all fleſh, ſhould not be for them but us, that he may give to us eternal life, who are a little remnant of worthleſs inconſiderable men; That Chriſt ſhould have ſo great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for ſuch a little petty company, this is mercy with a witneſs: Let us ſit down and wonder at it, and be thankful for it while we have a day to live.</p>
               <p>And thus far of the end of the authority of Jeſus Chriſt; for which he is inveſted with it by his Father, conſidered in the lump and in the groſs.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to take it into parts. It is in general, as you have heard, that he may be enabled to diſpence to his people, that which is for their everlaſting welfare and ſalvation, that he may give eternal life to as many as God hath given him: Particularly we have here to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Firſt the thing it ſelf to be diſpenced by vertue of this power and this authority of Jeſus Chriſt, and that is life, yea life eternal. Secondly the manner or the way of diſpenſation, it is to be diſpenced as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a way of free donation, that he ſhould give eternal life. Thirdly the objects of this diſpenſation, or the perſons to whom this life here mentioned is to be diſpenced, and that is not to all men, but to as many as the Father hath beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Begin we with the thing it ſelf to be diſpenced, by vertue of this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and this authority of Jeſus Chriſt: And here let us take notice of the nature of it, and of the adjunct of it. Firſt of the nature of it, it is life: Then of the adjunct of it, it is life eternal.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, my Brethren, you muſt know that naturally, and originally we are all dead men. We are all dead born, we came into
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:46169:58"/>
the world, my Brethren, in a ſtate of death and condemnation. And in this ſad condition we continue of our ſelves, we are not able to put life into our ſelves. No, we can no more raiſe our ſelves to the life of grace, then a dead man can raiſe himſelf to the life of nature. And therefore God, becauſe he would have ſuch a number quickened as he hath reſolved upon, hath given power to Jeſus Chriſt to this end, and to this purpoſe, that he may give life to thoſe who of themſelves are utterly void of it, and no way able to attain it.</p>
               <p>And that his mercy may be full, he hath appointed him to give them ſuch a life as is uncapable of diſſolution. The life that <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of innocency enjoyed, the life of righteouſneſs; and the life of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, you know, was periſhable in it ſelf, and ſo accordingly was left of God. His ſtate in this condition was mutable, and accordingly he fell from it, from a ſtate of grace and life, to a ſtate of ſin and death. But now God hath inveſted Jeſus Chriſt with power to give his people ſuch a life as ſhall be durable, as ſhall, in this reſpect, tranſcend the life that <hi>Adam</hi> had, even in the ſtate of innocency it ſelf; <hi>that he may give eternal life to as many as God hath given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The points to be obſerved are two: Firſt, <hi>They that are Chriſts have life from Chriſt;</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>The life which they have from him is eternal.</hi>
               </p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> They that are Chriſts, have life from Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>He giveth life to as many as God hath given him. The life which they enjoy, they have from him, they have it not originally in themſelves; he is the author and the fountain of it. And therefore he is ſaid to be a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. becauſe he quickneth and enliveneth all his members. And he is called <hi>our life</hi> very often in the Scripture, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> ſaith our Saviour of himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him in glory, Col.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life,</hi> that is, the author, the efficient of our life. And hence, ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>he that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve to prove the point, <hi>They that are Chriſts, have life from Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to open it a little before we come to application, there is a two-fold life which all Chriſts people have from Chriſt, according to the two-fold death which they are under out of Chriſt. For as there is a two-fold death in ſin: The death in ſin with relation to the raign and dominion of it, the death in ſin with relation to the guilt and obligation of it to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: So on the other ſide there is a two-fold life of grace oppoſed to theſe, the life of grace inherent, and the life of grace imputed. The life of holineſs, and the life of righteouſneſs. The life of Sanctification, and the life of Juſtification. And both of theſe, they that are Chriſts, receive from him, he gives his people both theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Chriſts people have from him the life of holineſs, or the life
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:46169:58"/>
of Sanctification, which is oppoſed to the dominion and the raign of ſin; before they are revived by him, they are under this dominion, and ſo in that reſpect are dead, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimates to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 6.12. <hi>ye are alive to God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> And what doth he infer upon it? <hi>Let not ſin raign in your mortal bodies;</hi> by which he intimates expreſly, that while ſin raigns in any man, ſo that he voluntarily reſigns and yields himſelf up to the rule and the dominion of it, as Subjects to their Soveraign and annointed Prince, he is not alive to God; he is indeed a dead man, he hath no life of holineſs or grace in him. But when the raign of ſin is once aboliſhed and diſſolved within him, ſo that he doth no longer willingly obey it in the luſts thereof, but yieldeth up himſelf to God, then he is alive to God, then he lives the life of God; the life of holineſs and grace. And this life he hath from Chriſt; And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>ye are alive to God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord:</hi> And of this life it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. and makes Chriſt the Fountain of it: <hi>I live,</hi> ſaith he, that is, I live the life of grace; and <hi>yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and this life which I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Chriſts people have from him the life of righteouſneſs, or the life of Juſtification, which ſtands in oppoſition to the death in ſin, with relation to the guilt. While the guilt of ſin remains upon a man, ſo long that perſon is a dead man, ſo long he is dead in Law, as we expreſs it commonly, he is bound over to eternal death and condemnation. And thus it is with every man while he continues in the ſtate of nature. He is condemned to die, and ſo in that reſpect is dead in the ſentence of the Law: although the ſentence be not executed on him, as our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>John</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believes not is condemned already:</hi> But when a man is juſtified, abſolved, and acquitted from the guilt of all his ſins, he is no longer dead in Law, but as a Malefactor that is pardoned, his life is given him, as we uſe to ſay. And therefore it is ſtiled in Scripture <hi>the juſtification of life,</hi> becauſe it brings life to the perſon juſtified, <hi>viz.</hi> that life that is oppoſed to condemnation, the ſentence or the doom of death; For of that ſpeaks the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>the free gift came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all to juſtification of life.</hi> And this is made the gift of Chriſt, and he is ſaid to be the author and the fountain of this life, in that place. <hi>As by the offence of one</hi> (that is of <hi>Adam) judgement came upon all men to condemnation, ſo by the righteouſneſs of one</hi> (that is of Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam) the free gift came upon all to juſtification of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my Brethren, that <hi>they that are Chriſts have life from <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Chriſt?</hi> here then examine in the firſt place, whether you be Chriſts or no. If you belong to him (I mean by real calling and incorporation) you have received life from him. You hear he hath received power from God the Father to this very end, that <hi>he may give eternal life to as many as God hath given him.</hi> And out of queſtion he is not unfaithful in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of this power and the diſcharge of this truſt. Well then, if you be his, he hath given you this life, he hath quickened you, and raiſed you with himſelf, you are partakers of his reſurrection. And therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you ſearch a little whether it be thus with you or no.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:46169:59"/>It is a thing which may be known in ſome degree, if you be diligent; for the Apoſtle knew that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> were alive, that they were quickned from the death of ſin: And this he did by outward evidence and by the ſigns of life which he obſerved in them. And we may much more know our own Condition and eſtate in this reſpect if we be not very wanting to our ſelves. And therefore prove your ſelves, my brethren, whether you have the life of Chriſt in you, and you may do it by theſe ſymptoms following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt if you have received life from Chriſt, you are ſtrangely altered men; ſome little alteration there may be in ſome reſpects, and yet a man may ſcarcely note it, or obſerve it in himſelf. But when ſo great a change as this ſhall paſs upon him, it is impoſſible almoſt but he ſhould feel it. There be many alterations that may happen to a man in the paſſage of his life, as cuſtom and experience make a change, and honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make a change, a great change in ſome men, eſpecially in weak ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and age, and time, and place, and many other things do make a change. But this infuſion of the life of Chriſt into a perſon that was dead before, is the greateſt change of all. It makes a man a new creature, and that in all reſpects too, which is a very great matter. <hi>Old things are done away, all things are become new,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. He hath new thoughts and new affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, new pleaſures and delights, ſtudies, deſires, ends, purpoſes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and acquaintance; So that he is not now the ſame man that he was before. When his old luſts, his old temptations, his old companions and acquaintance come to call upon him, and think to find him as they did in former times; he may anſwer them and ſay You are deceived, for I am altered, I am another man, another creature, I am not in the temper nor of the diſpoſition that I was before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If you have received life from Chriſt, you have within you ſharp deſires after the food by which this life is nouriſhed and preſerved. The word of God (my brethren) is the milk that feeds it, which every child of God delights to ſuck, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. And have you quick and ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring appetites to this milk? do you as new born babes deſire it? do you thirſt and long for it? do you hunger after it, ſo that you cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent without it? is it pleaſing to your palate, delicious to your taſte to feed upon? it is an evidence of life. But if there be no ſtomack to this kind of food, if you be well content without it, if you be never hungry, if you find no taſte at all in the good word of God, but ſay of this as <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the Manna once, Our ſouls loaths this light bread, there is no weight, no ſubſtance in it, it is a ſign you have not yet this light of Chriſt in you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, If you have received life from Chriſt, you are moved, you are acted by the principles of that life. Every kind of life (my brethren) hath principles agreeable to it, inclining it to turn to that which ſuites with it, and on the other ſide to turn from that which is deſtructive and contrary to it. So hath the vegetative life, the life of plants; ſo hath the ſenſitive, the life of beaſts; ſo hath the reaſonable life, the life of men, and ſo hath the life of Chriſt, the life of Saints. Now this life of Chriſt my brethren, hath principles exceedingly above the principles of any
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:46169:59"/>
of thoſe other ſorts of life. And ſo accordingly, they that have this life from Chriſt, do live by higher principles, (I will not ſay then thoſe of plants or thoſe of beaſts, but, then thoſe of men too; thoſe who are meerly men, and no more; who are not holy, ſanctified men.</p>
                  <p>Some men there are you know, who live like beaſts, who melt away in ſenſual and voluptuous pleaſures and delights, who eat, and drink, and ſleep, and luſt, and ſatisfie their luſts, and there is all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſaid in Scripture to be brutiſh, becauſe the brute part in them over-powers the rational, becauſe they live and walk by brutiſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by the principles of beaſts. They do juſt as beaſts do, and many of them worſe too, as if they were to have the ſame end that beaſts have. And ſome of late have vented ſuch doctrine as if the ſouls of men did periſh with their bodies, as the ſouls of beaſts do. Others there are who live like men indeed, but it is like meer men, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</hi> They live at beſt no higher then the principles of reaſon carry them, and that is but a litt e way. They bring them at the very utmoſt no further then the young man which our Saviour ſpeaks of, to be not far from the Kingdom of heaven, or not ſo far as many others are, but they can never bring them home.</p>
                  <p>But they that have received life from Chriſt, my brethren, live by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and diviner principles then theſe are, ſuch as are full of light and beauty, ſuch as carry on the ſoul to ſupernatural and ſpiritual things, for the attaining and enjoying of the higheſt good. They know what it is to live above the principles of beaſts, above the principles of men, they live by principles of faith of ſpirituall men: which are far more above the principles of reaſon, then the principles of reaſon are above the principles of ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if you have received life from Chriſt, you live to Chriſt; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and therefore it is called the life of Chriſt, becauſe as it comes from Chriſt, ſo on the other ſide, it tends to Chriſt, from whom it comes. It cauſes us to live no longer to our ſelves, but to him that died for us, that is to Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. All other men who have not this life in them, live to themſelves, and not to Chriſt; they have no higher end then ſelf in all their actions; They make themſelves, their pleaſures, or their profits, or their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours the ſcope and center of their motions; Yea in the very holy and religious duties they perform, they look no further then their own ends; And ſo in the performance of them, they are but ſervants to their own Luſts.</p>
                  <p>But now they that have life from Chriſt, they live no longer to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; no, they have nobler aims in all their wayes; and while unſanctified men, who live the life of nature only, do make themſelves their end, even in their holy and religious duties; the Saints who live the life of Chriſt, do make the Lord their end, even in their ordinary, and their Common acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In every thing his glory is continually in their eye, even in their worldly and their ſecular employments, while in theſe they do not ſeek their own things, but the things that are of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Ah my beloved, what cauſe have we to magnifie and to admire the grace of Chriſt, that he ſhould give us this life; That he ſhould raiſe us from our graves of ſin, having looſed the powers of death, that we might not beholden of them! We think that we can never be ſufficiently thankfull to one that hath ſaved our lives and reſcued us out of the jaws of death. Now Jeſus Chriſt who is our life, hath done this for us; we were condemned perſons, we were dead in Law, and he (by virtue of the power, and the authority with which he is inveſted by his father) hath given us our lives, he hath ſealed a pardon to us: So that now we may walk abroad at large, and need not fear that the ſentence of the Law, the doom of death will be executed on us; Ah my beloved, what ſhall we return to Chriſt? how ſhall we melt our ſouls into ſufficient celebrations of his goodneſs to us?

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The life which Jeſus Chriſt beſtows upon his people is eternal.</head>
                  <p>SO it is ſtiled in my text: you ſee that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as God hath given him. Such is the life which Chriſt gives: it is a Laſting and enduring life, a life that is above the power of death, that is uncapable of diſſolution. The life of nature as you know, and ſee my brethren, is a periſhable life. It is obnoxious to decay, it may be cut off in the twinkling of an eye, and we are gone. But now this life of Chriſt, the life of grace is the beginning of the life of glory, and therefore is an endleſs life, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16. And as the ſeed by which this life is generated in a man, is incorruptible ſeed, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. even ſo the life it ſelf which is generated by it, is incorruptible too. It may be ſaid of every Saint who hath received life from Chriſt, and who is raiſed by him from the death of ſin, as it is ſaid of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Being raiſed from the dead, he dies no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> He hath eternal life abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:46169:60"/>
in him as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 6.54. He doth not ſay that he ſhall have it, but that he hath it in him, even in this preſent world, a Life that is eternal and that is abiding in him.</p>
                  <p>So that the point is plain you ſee, <hi>The life which Jeſus Chriſt beſtows upon his people, is eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To cleer it yet a little further to you, my beloved, no life can end in death, or come to diſſolution, and deſtruction, but one of theſe two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> either by ſome inward principles of frailty in it ſelf, or elſe by ſome outward force that overcomes it, and prevails againſt it. If it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by death, it muſt be either by a natural, or a violent death. Now the life of Jeſus Chriſt which he beſtows upon his people, is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diſſolution either way, and conſequently is an everlaſting life, as I ſhall ſhew you briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the life which Jeſus Chriſt beſtows upon his people, hath no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> principles of frailty, and diſſolution in it ſelf, it hath no ſeeds of morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in it. It comes from Chriſt not only as the giver of it, but alſo from him as the fountain of it; with him is the fountain of Life, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9. And the Rivulets and ſtreams are alwayes of the ſelf ſame nature with the fountain. And conſequently if the life that is in Chriſt, be laſting and enduring, as it is, the life that is from Chriſt, is ſo too. If it be not periſhable in the ſpring, aſſuredly it is not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable in the ſtream. This life of grace, my brethren, is communicated and derived from Chriſt the root, to us the branches, from him the head to us the members; and if it fail not in the head, and in the root, how ſhould it fail in the members and the Branches. Indeed my brethren if the life of grace were radically and originally in our ſelves, and from our ſelves, it muſt have principles of diſſolution in it. For what that is in us, and comes from us, can be eternal in its own nature? But our life is in Chriſt, and comes from Chriſt, it is hid with Chriſt in God, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. and therefore certainly it is in this reſpect like him from whom it comes. We ſtand not now upon our own bottoms, as <hi>Adam</hi> did it in Paradiſe; no we are branches of ſuch a Vine as never withers, &amp; we are members of ſuch a head as never dies. So that undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, the life of Jeſus in us, although it be not priviledged from abatements and temptations, yet it hath nothing in it that tends to utter diſſolution.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the life which Jeſus Chriſt beſtows upon his people, as it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hath no inward principles of diſſolution in it ſelf, ſo neither is there any outward force that can prevail againſt it to deſtroy it, Chriſt will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and maintain it in us, in ſpite of any oppoſition. The world may ſet upon us, and endeavour to extinguiſh this life of holineſs and grace in us, ſhe may aſſault us with her violent tentations every way, with promiſes, and ſweet inſinuations on the one ſide, with threats and bloody perſecutions on the other; But this we may relie upon, the world ſhall never overcome us, for Chriſt hath overcome the world. And we muſt know, that Chriſt hath overcome the world, not for himſelf alone, but for his members. And as he overcame it for us, ſo he doth overcome it in us too, by his grace, as the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. <hi>This is the victory that overcomes the world even your faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:46169:61"/>The Devil is a far more ſubtile and pernitious adverſary then the world, but yet he cannot overthrow this life of grace, in any of the Saints. The gates of Hell cannot ſo far prevail againſt them. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent can but bruiſe the heel of Chriſt, and thoſe that appertain to Chriſt, he cannot touch the head or breaſt, he cannot wound us in the vital parts, or take away our life from us.</p>
                  <p>The fleſh is the worſt enemy of all in this reſpect, becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enemy, and a mortal enemy. Either that muſt die or we, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. But here's our Comfort now, the the fleſh ſhall die, and we ſhall live; Chriſt will deſtroy the fleſh in us, and he will put the Spirit into us, and maintain the Spirit in us. And by this Spirit we ſhall live, and this life ſhall be eternal, <hi>We ſhall of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap life everlaſting, Gal.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p>So that the point you ſee is fully cleered, <hi>The life which Jeſus Chriſt beſtowes, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt it hath no inward principles of frailty in it ſelf; And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no outward force that can prevail againſt it to deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be you will interpoſe thoſe words of the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>v.</hi> of his Epiſtle, where he ſpeaks of ſome Revolters who were <hi>twice dead,</hi> for that is his expreſſion there; <hi>they are trees whoſe fruit withereth,</hi>

                     <hi>twice dead plucked up by the roots.</hi> And how were they twice dead? They were not dead at all in regard of their outward and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, for they were then alive, and working miſchief in the Church; and therefore out of queſtion, his intention muſt be this, Firſt they were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Then for a while in ſome reſpect or ſence, they lived the life of Grace. And afterwards they died again, and ſo they were twice dead, and how then is the Doctrine true, <hi>The life which Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For reſolution of the Scruple, you muſt know my brethren, that a man may live the life of grace, either in deed and truth, or elſe in ſhew and appearance only. The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> lived in ſhew, <hi>ſhe had a name,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> (our Saviour tells her) <hi>that ſhe was alive, but ſhe was dead, Rev.</hi> 3.1. There was but a name of life, ſhe had a name that ſhe did live, but there was the reality of Death, ſhe was dead. Now they that live in name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who have the ſhew and the appearance of the life of Chriſt, may die in ſhew and in appearance too. And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common apprehenſion, and conceit of men, ſaith they were twice dead. Once indeed and really, before they gave ſo much as any outward evidence of life. And then again in ſhew, and in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when they loſt that life of grace, which both to others and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they ſeemed to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, <hi>that the life which Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. This then ſhould ſtay <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> us and ſupport us, againſt the fear of thoſe tentations which threaten us with the deſtruction of the life of grace. It is a great affliction to the Saints, ſometimes when they are mightily aſſaulted by Satan, and their own corruptions, and even ready to be overcome, they cry out with relation to their ſpiritual, as <hi>Job</hi> with reſpect to his natural life, <hi>What is my ſtrength that I ſhould hope?</hi> What grace have I, that I ſhould hold
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:46169:61"/>
out againſt ſuch violent Encounters as theſe are? How ſhould I hope to live, when my life is thus aſſaulted with ſuch fiery darts without, with ſuch diſtempers, noxious humours, and ſuch luſts within? Oh but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my beloved, Chriſt gives eternal life to his people, a life that is not ſubject to deſtruction, either by inward weakneſs, or outward violence: If ever once you have it from him, you can never loſe it. He that once lives the life of Chriſt, can never die, death hath no more dominion over him.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, my brethren, that the life of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This then may clear and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> comfort us againſt the frailty and diſſolution of the life of nature. It's true, my brethren, that is ſubject to decay, it is a periſhable life, but this is an eternal life; That may and will be loſt indeed, but this endures to all eternity. And why then are we ſo afraid of death? why doth it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us and affright us ſo? when it hath done its utmoſt, we ſhall live for ever. Why are we grieved and troubled when they die the death of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who have the life of Chriſt in them? Truly my brethren, we may ſay of ſuch as our Saviour of the Damſell, they are not dead. As Chriſt to <hi>Martha,</hi> when ſhe bewailed the loſs of her dear brother <hi>Lazarus, John</hi> 11.26. <hi>Whoſoever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die;</hi> He ſhall never die the death that overthrows the life of Chriſt, the life of Grace; for ſo you muſt conceive him there in that place; <hi>q. d. Lazarus</hi> is a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and therefore whatſoever thou maiſt apprehend, he is not dead. He is not dead in reference to that which is a Chriſtians life indeed; no true believer is capable of dying ſo; <hi>whoſoever liveth and believeth in me can never die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's true my brethren, ſuch may loſe the life of nature, but that alas is but an image, and a ſhadow and a ſhew of life. The life of grace and holineſs is life indeed; he that liveth in ſin is dead while he lives; he that lives in holineſs is alive when he dies: and if the life of nature be not worth the name of life, then certainly the death that overthrows no other but the life of nature, deſerveth not the name of death. And hence the death of true believers, which ſtrips them only of the life which ſtands in union of the body and the ſoul together, and not of that which ſtands in union of them both to Chriſt, is ſtiled a reſt, a ſleep, in Scripture, not a death. They only die indeed which go down quick to hell as the prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, who are caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death, who after many pangs and tortures ſuffered in the ſeparation of the body from the ſoul, are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted everlaſtingly from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that the life which Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh how doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> us then my brethren, not to ſatisfie our ſelves with the frail life of nature, which may expire upon a ſuddain, and let us ſink into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death; but to make out after the life of Jeſus Chriſt, the life of grace which is above the reach and power of death, which will not fail us but endure for ever? We all have ſparks of immortality within us, and we have thoughts aſpiring to Eternity, we would not die if we could chooſe. Oh let us labour then, my brethren, for the life of grace, and this is an
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:46169:62"/>
eternal life. The life of nature is a fading thing, it may be gone upon a ſuddain. And it is a ſad and dreadfull thing for an eternal ſoul, to have nothing elſe between it and eternal woe and torture but ſuch a fickle and periſhable life, which the next minute may be done, and let him drop away to hell for ever. Oh how ſuddainly may ſuch periſh, and come to a fearful End! but if we live the life of Chriſt, that is a laſting and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. And though the natural life decay, and though the body die and rot, and turn to duſt and putrefaction, yet this will flouriſh and grow ſtronger ſtill, till it be perfected and made conſummate in the life of glory. And why then are our labours and endeavours wholly ſpent to nouriſh and maintain this tranſitory life, with things that periſh in the uſing, which yet when all is done will fail, and come to diſſolution, but never ſtrive for the attainment of that life which is eternal? It is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable thing, my brethren, that the divine intentions of eternal minds ſhould be laid out on nothing elſe but periſhable things. Now that you may attain this laſting and enduring life of grace, I ſhall but give you two or three directions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, You muſt ſtrive for ſaving knowledge and ſeek to get your minds enlightned with the beams of truth. The life of holineſs and grace conſiſts in light. And hence ſaith the Evangeliſt, that light, <hi>viz.</hi> the light of ſaving knowledge from the ſon of God revealed and manifeſted in the Goſpel, was the life of men, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.4. And in the words imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately adjoyned to my text, <hi>that he may give eternal life, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Its true indeed there may be light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without any life of grace: But there can never be the life of grace without the light of holy knowledge: And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Gentiles, ſaith, <hi>they were ſtrangers from the life of God:</hi> they lived the life of men, but they were ſtrangers from the life of God, the life of grace, by reaſon of the ignorance and darkneſs that was in them. And ſurely, if we ever look to riſe up from our graves of ſin, and ſtand up from the dead, we muſt have light from Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, You muſt endeavour after faith, which is the inſtrument and means of life, by which it is conveyed from Chriſt to all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And therefore we ſhall find that faith and life, believing and living are joyned together, the one as the fruit and effect of the other. <hi>Whoſoever liveth and believeth in me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.26. <hi>(id eſt)</hi> Whoſoever liveth by believing in me <hi>ſhall never die. He that believeth in him that ſent me, hath eternal life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.24. <hi>and ſhall not come to condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life. Theſe things are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ye might believe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have life,</hi> Joh. 20. ult. <hi>I live</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, and yet, &amp;c. and the life which I live I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> So that the grace of faith you ſee my brethren, is the inſtrument of life, it is the bond of union between Chriſt and all his members, it is the Artery by which his Spirit is conveyed into us. And therefore if you ever look to live, you muſt labour after faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:46169:62"/>Thirdly, that you may attain to ſaving knowledge and to juſtifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> faith, and conſequently to this life of Chriſt, you muſt attend upon the voice of Chriſt, in the preaching of the Goſpel. For that is an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means when God is pleaſed to concurr, to raiſe men from the death of ſin, and to make them live to God. And this is clearly intimated to us by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 5.25. <hi>The hour cometh,</hi> ſaith Chriſt there, <hi>when the dead</hi> (the dead in ſin) <hi>ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God,</hi> (conceive it in the powerful preaching of the Goſpel) <hi>and they that hear it ſhall live.</hi> And hence the word of Chriſt is called <hi>the word of life.</hi> You ſee then what you are to do; I ſay to you, my Brethren, as the Prophet to the Jews, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>Hear with an obedient ear, a flexible and yielding heart, hear and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far of the thing to be diſpenced by vertue of the power and the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with which he is inveſted by the Father; And this as you have heard is life, yea it is Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>The manner or the way of diſpenſation comes next in order to be handled; it is to be diſpenced as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a way of free donation, that he ſhould give Eternal life.</p>
                  <p>Not that he ſhould communicate it, or confer it only, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that he ſhould give.</hi> So that you ſee, my Brethren, all is free both on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide, and on the Sons. The Father he is free to him, that he may be free to others. The Father gives him power, that he may give his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple life. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no difficulty in the terms, the point is obvious.</p>

But mark it well, not upon the ſame terms. Death follows ſin as the deſerved ſtipend, and the wages of it: A man earneth death by ſin; as a work-man earns his wages by his labour. But life Eternal doth not follow holineſs in ſuch a way;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:46169:63"/>
it is not merited by our obedience, as death is by our diſobedience: and therefore this is a gratuity, a gift, though that be wages. <hi>The wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in another place, our laſt tranſlation ſpeaketh it a free gift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. <hi>The free gift came upon all men</hi> (all that are Chriſts members, or upon all men univerſally, if you reſpect the tender of it) <hi>the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.</hi> With which accordeth that which goes immediately before, <hi>they which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſs, ſhall ragn in life by one, and that is Chriſt.</hi> I ſhall cloſe up the proofs with our Saviours proclamation, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.6. <hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the beginning and the end, and I will give to him that is athirſt of the fountain of the water of life freely; if any be athirſt, if he have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement and ſtrong deſires, he ſhall have life, and he ſhall have it from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I will beſtow it on him, and I will do it freely too. I will give him of the water of life freely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the point is plain you ſee, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt doth freely give Eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that you may the better ſee the freeneſs of this gift of his, and that it is beſtowed upon his people without the leaſt deſert of theirs, I ſhall lay it open to you in a few particulars; Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be free in giving life to his members, becauſe on their parts, it is firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought, and ſecondly unſought, nay thirdly unthought. They do not purchaſe it, or buy it of him; nay nor ſo much as ſeek it or deſire it of him; nay nor ſo much as think of having ſuch a mercy from him: And therefore it muſt needs be abſolutely free in all reſpects, it muſt come from him as a free gift.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be free in giving life to his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is by them unbought. Life is not their purchaſe, and therefore it is his gift. True, it is bought by Chriſt for us, but it is not bought of Chriſt by us. For let us ſeriouſly conſider with our ſelves, What could we give or do to procure this life from Chriſt? We are not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem our natural life, which yet is in compariſon of no value, nor pay a ranſom to the Lord for it. It is too great a price for us to pay, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt ceaſe for ever, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks. And how much leſs then are we able to redeem our ſpiritual life, which is infinitely precious, when we are under the Condemnatory ſentence of the Law, when we are dead in treſpaſſes and ſin, both with relation to the raign and to the guilt, when we are ſubject every moment to be caſt <hi>into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone,</hi> which is the ſecond death; what can we give now to obtain our pardon? we cannot purchaſe it; and therfore certainly we have it freely.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Chriſt buyes a pardon for us, becauſe we cannot buy it for our ſelves. He gives his blood and life for us, that he may give life to us. And therefore he is called our <hi>life,</hi> to ſhew that he is all in all in that buſineſs. And when we firſt receive his quickning grace, we are deſcribed to be in ſuch a caſe, that there is nothing upon our parts to procure it, as you may ſee, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.5, 6. Caſt out into the open fields, to the loathing of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>polluted, in our own blood,</hi> and weltering in our own gore. And then, yea
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:46169:63"/>
then he gives life to us. It is repeated twice in that place, as a remarkable &amp; choice thing, that we may take eſpecial notice of it. I <hi>ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood live, yea I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood live.</hi> As if he ſhould have thus expreſſed himſelf, Obſerve it well, I gave thee life at ſuch a time when there was nothing in thee to deſerve it at my hands, when one would even have loathed to touch thee, or to meedle with thee: when thou hadſt nothing elſe but blood and gore to give me, then did I breath this life into thee; So that you ſee Chriſt freely gives this life to his people, in this reſpect, that it is by them unbought.</p>
                  <p>And as it is by them unbought, ſo it is by them unſought.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they do not purchaſe it and buy it of him, ſo neither do they ſeek it, or deſire it of him. As they do not pay for it, ſo neither do they pray for it. We count a thing is very free, if we have it for the asking. If it be but <hi>ask and have,</hi> its a very cheap bargain. The life of Chriſt is yet more free then this comes to: to all his members he gives it them before they ask it. He is found in this reſpect of them that <hi>ſeek him not, and ask not for him;</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. It is the diſpoſition of us all by nature, we will not come to Chriſt, that we may have life from him, as he himſelf complaineth, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. and therefore he is fain to draw us. Did <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he lay dead and ſtinking in his grave, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to Chriſt, beſeeching him to raiſe him up? No more do any that are dead in ſin No, Chriſt is fain to ſeek them out, to come to the grave himſelf, and there to call them to come forth, and to put life into them, that they may anſwer that call; he is forced to do all. Did the loſt ſheep ſeek the Shepherd? Did the loſt groat ſeek the Owner? When <hi>Adam</hi> being falen had brought himſelf into a ſtate of death and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, did he ſeek God, or did God ſeek him? Did he call God, or did God call him? You ſee the offer was on Gods part, not on his. And ſo if Chriſt ſhould leave us in a ſtate of death, till we ſue to him for life, we ſhould die eternally. But he preventeth us with mercy, and with loving kindneſs. And he commands the bleſſing, even life for evermore, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.3. They do not beg it and entreate it, but he <hi>commands it.</hi> So that you ſee Chriſt freely gives this life to his people, in this reſpect, that it is by them unſought.</p>
                  <p>And as it is by them unbought and unſought, ſo it is by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are ſo far from ſeeking it, that they do not once ſo much as think upon it. It comes not once into their heads that they are <hi>dead in treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and ſins;</hi> That there is life in Jeſus Chriſt; that he is ready to beſtow it, and to give it out to loſt creatures. When he breaths this life of grace into any of his people, it is as much unthought of to them, as <hi>Sauls</hi> Crown was to him, when he ſought his Fathers Aſſes. What can a dead man plod and ſtudy of a reſurrection? Doth he lie in his grave expecting when he ſhall be quickened, and looking when he ſhall be raiſed up? What did the Diſciples think of their Converſion till Chriſt called them? <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> was in the midſt of his Extortion, <hi>Peter</hi> was buſie at his trade, when Chriſt inſpired the quickning life of grace into them. Little did either of them think that life and mercy was ſo near to them. And thus
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:46169:64"/>
he deals in this reſpect with all his people. So that which way ſoever we conſider it or look upon it, Jeſus Chriſt doth freely give Eternal life to his people, they have it from him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Now to deſcend to Application; Is it ſo that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth freely give,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This then may be a great encouragement for every one of us to come to Jeſus Chriſt for life. It is confeſſed that he hath enough in him; but yet if he were loth to ſpare it, if he did very hardly part from it, if he did not give but ſell it, and ſell it at a dear rate, it could not but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſhearten thoſe that want it, and have no means to get it, nor any thing to give for it. But now conſider for your comfort and ſupport, that Jeſus Chriſt is appointed by his Father, and inclined of himſelf to give Eternal life to his people. He doth not deal with it as a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which he means to gain by, but as a favour which he is willing graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to beſtow upon a company of loſt creatures. He ſtands and cries, <hi>He every one that thirſteth, come and drink of the water of life freely;</hi> I ask you not a penny for it, <hi>come and buy without money and without price;</hi> Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, ſet your hearts to this buſineſs; conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly what you have to do; I ſay to you as <hi>Iacob</hi> to his ſons, when they were about to ſtarve, when they were about to die with famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Why do you look one upon another?</hi> Why do you die and periſh in your ſins, when there is life enough in Jeſus Chriſt, and where it is ſo eaſily to be obtained from him?</p>
                  <p>Oh you will ſay, we are unworthy to have life from Chriſt; who are we that Chriſt ſhould look upon ſuch dead dogs as we are! Ah, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber he doth not bargain for it, he doth not ſell it, but beſtows it freely. He gives it out to thoſe ſometimes who leaſt deſerve it, he looks for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in, or from you, but the receiving of it at his hands. Why then will you ſtand off when he calls? Why will you refuſe life when Chriſt offers, and when he offers it ſo freely? Why will you give the Lord of life occaſion to complain, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.40. <hi>You will not come to me that you may have life,</hi> you will not come when you may have it for the fetching.</p>
                  <p>Why you will ſay, perhaps, you cannot come; True, I confeſs you cannot in your natural eſtate; but yet the greateſt matter is, you will not come. And this appears, becauſe you do not many of you what you can, and what is in your power to do. You do not wait upon the word of life, the word by which he worketh life in his people, but ſhamefully neglect it many of you, when the word is nigh you, when it is juſt without your doors. Chriſt ſpeaks in life unto the ſouls of men, the words that he ſpeaks <hi>are life,</hi> as 'tis hiw own expreſſion, and you will not hearken to them that your ſouls may live, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. you do not yield your ſelves up to the operation of the words of Chriſt. When he begins to ſtir you, you reſiſt the work of it. When it begins to quicken you, and raiſe you up, you cloſe your eyes, and lie down in your graves of ſin again. Now, I beſeech you, Brethren, when you feel a little ſtirring, a little quickning by the word, O let this word of life have a perfect work upon you. When life is offered in the Goſpel, do not put it from you, and judge your ſelves
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:46169:64"/>
unworthy of Eternal life, leaſt Chriſt ſay to you in diſpleaſure, Nay, if you will not live, then die for me, and die for ever. And if you will not riſe out of your graves, there lye, and rott, and ſtink for me, till you be raiſed to receive your laſt doom, and <hi>to be caſt into the Lake that burns with fire and brimſtone,</hi> which is the ſecond death.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, <hi>that Ieſus Chriſt doth freely give,</hi> &amp;c. This then may ſerve us <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> as an Antidote againſt the fear of loſing the life which we receive from Chriſt, and that upon a double ground. For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if Jeſus Chriſt give it, he himſelf will not withdraw it, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and increaſe it. He doth not uſe to give a thing and take a thing; no my Beloved, his gifts and callings are without repentance. Its true, that the duration of this life depends upon continual animation and ſupply from Chriſt. If once the vital influence which we have from him be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted and with-held, we are ſurely dead men. But wherefore ſhould we doubt that he will fail to animate us, or that he will with-hold the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of this life from us? Nothing without himſelf did induce him firſt to give it. And therefore on the ſelf-ſame ground, he will uphold it and maintain it. He gave it freely, and therefore certainly he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue it as freely too. Yea he will be ſo far from leſſening and extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this life of his, in any of his Saints, that he will encreaſe it ſtill. As it ſhall be a laſting and enduring, ſo it ſhall be a growing and encreaſing life. This was the end of his coming, as his own expreſſion is, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly.</hi> If they have a little more, they ſhall not have leſs, but more. Chriſt gives his people the fountain of life, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.6. not the ſtream only, but the fountain too. The ſtream may fail, but the fountain cannot fail. At leaſt the ſtream might fail, but that it is continually fed and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the fountain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if Chriſt give his people life, as he himſelf will not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it, ſo he will not ſuffer it to be deſtroyed by any other. He will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly maintain his own act, his own gift, againſt the power of hell itſelf. Depend upon it, you that have received life from Chriſt, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death ſhall have no power upon you. It may aſſault you and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt you, but it ſhall not overcome you. <hi>I give my ſheep eternal life,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. and what follows? Why as I give it, ſo I will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it too; I will make good this gift of mine, againſt the greateſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>and they ſhall never periſh, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, <hi>that Chriſt Ieſus doth freely give,</hi> &amp;c. the greater thankfulneſs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> is due to him from all that have received this life from him. If he had ſold it, our gratitude had been prevented. If we had purchaſed it, or deſerved it, we might have thanked our ſelves, and not Chriſt. For who will give another thanks for that which he paid for? But now the buſineſs is contrived and managed ſo that Chriſt may have much praiſe and much glory. If he give you life, do you give him thanks, expreſſed by holineſs and by obedience. Leſs then this you cannot tender, and more then this Chriſt doth not expect from you.</p>

               <p>AND thus far of the thing it ſelf to be diſpenſed by virtue of the power and the authority of Jeſus Chriſt with which he is inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Father, and that is life, yea, it is Eternal life. As alſo of the manner or the way of diſpenſation, it is to be diſpenſed as a gift, in the nature of a gift, in a way of free donation, <hi>That he ſhould give eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The objects of this diſpenſation, or the perſons to whom this life here mentioned is to be diſpenſed, comes now in order to be handled, and they are ſuch, only ſuch, and all ſuch, as God the Father hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi> My text you ſee is ſtill upon a ſtrain of giving, God gives the Son power, that the Son may <hi>give life to thoſe whom God gives him; to as many as God hath given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not hear that Jeſus Chriſt hath power to give Eternal life to all the world, to all men, but only to a certain, pitcht, ſelected Company of men. And they my brethren, are ſo far from being all, that they are not ſaid expreſly to be many, but as many, and they may be no great number. <hi>That he ſhould give Eternal life to as many as God hath given him,</hi> who are comparatively, but a few. <hi>Many are called</hi> indeed, <hi>but few are choſen,</hi> and conſequently few are ſaved. They are not many then, if you compare them with the reſt that are not made partakers of this glorious priviledge to have life from Jeſus Chriſt, but yet they are as many as God hath <hi>given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the perſons are deſcribed who are to have this life from Chriſt, not by their own internal quality or diſpoſition, not by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action, but by the act of of God upon them, or concerning them, his giving them to Jeſus Chriſt. Let them be what they will in all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations and reſpects beſides, it matters not in this regard; of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of what condition, or of what ſtation, or of what diſpoſition, or of what converſation, if God have given them to Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhall in his appointed time have life from him:</p>
               <p>But then we muſt diſtinguiſh of the Fathers giving to the Son. The Father gives men to his Son Chriſt, either for outward miniſtration, or elſe for inward Union and incorporation; either to be his ſervants, or to be his members.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe <hi>Judas</hi> himſelf was given to the Lord Chriſt to be his Miniſter, and his Apoſtle, as Chriſt himſelf acknowledgeth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly to his Father in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe</hi> of this very Chapter. <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I have kept, ſaith he, and none of them is loſt but the Son of Perdition.</hi> Now they who in this ſenſe are given to the Lord Chriſt, to be his Miniſters and ſervants only, not his members, have not eternal life
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46169:65"/>
from him, as is apparent from the former inſtance. <hi>Judas</hi> was given to him ſo, and yet he was a loſt Creature, yea, he is ſtiled in the fore-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged place the Son of perdition. <hi>None of them whom thou gaveſt me is loſt, but the ſon of perdition.</hi> One of them was loſt then, though there were but one loſt. The Father gave him to the Son, and he loſt him. And therefore he, <hi>Iudas</hi> I mean, though he were given him, had not eternal life from him.</p>
               <p>But now there are another ſort, whom God the Father gives to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for inward union, and incorparation, whom he beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to be members of his body, and they muſt needs have life from him, or elſe how ſhall they be his members? If there be union with him, there muſt be animation from him. As many as are given thus to Chriſt, ſhall certainly be quickned by him, he hath received autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power for this End. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee the meaning of the words: the points ſuggeſted here are two. Firſt there are a certain company of men, whom God the Father, in a ſpecial manner gives to Jeſus Chriſt. And ſecondly, That Jeſus Chriſt hath power to give eternal life to ſuch and all ſuch as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him by his Father, but he hath no power at all to give this life to any other. At this time of the firſt of theſe.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> There are a certain company of men whom God the father in a ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gives to Ieſus Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>Some have this priviledge above the reſt of loſt mankind, that God the Father gives them to his ſon Chriſt: and gives them to him in a ſpecial manner, as I ſhewed you even now, not to be his ſervants only, but his members too. He beſtows them upon Chriſt to be his own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar people. And this is cleerly intimated in that profeſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. <hi>this is my Fathers will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> The thing admitted there is cleer by this, that ſome are given him by his Father, and given him ſo that they are not to be loſt. And conſequently, in another way then <hi>Iudas</hi> was, who was beſtowed on Chriſt as you have heard, and yet he was the ſon of Perdition. So, in the 37. <hi>verſe</hi> he hath the ſame. Expreſſion, where he ſpeaks of all thoſe whom his Father gives him. And on this ground it is that Jeſus Chriſt laies claim to ſuch <hi>viz.</hi> by vertue of donation from his Father: <hi>Here am I, and the children which thou haſt given me. Thine they were</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.6. Mark that Expreſſion, <hi>Thine they were,</hi> as who ſhould ſays, Now they are thine no longer. They have been thine, I muſt acknowledge, but now the property in ſome reſpect is altered, they are no longer thine, but mine. Why, which way came you by them? might the Father ſay. The Son replies, by thy own free gift. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:46169:66"/>So that you ſee there are a company of men whom God the Father gives to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And further yet, They are a certain company of men: they are juſt thus many, not a perſon more or leſs, <hi>That he ſhould give eternal life to as many as God hath given him,</hi> ſo that the number of them is preciſely and exactly known to God: he knows how many there be of them to a man. He hath determined abſolutely, and unalterably with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that Chriſt ſhall have ſuch a number, ſo many millions, or the like. And he hath alſo peremptorily reſolved, that ſuch particular and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual perſons known to him from everlaſting, ſhall make up the number. <hi>Whom he fore-knew, them did he predeſtinate,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Thoſe very men and no others. And hence our saviour ſpeaks of ſuch as if he knew them every one by name. <hi>I pray for them. I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me, Iohn</hi> 17.9. So that our Saviour Chriſt diſtinguiſhes, you ſee, he knows who are his own by free donation of his Father, and for them he prayes. He knows who are not given up to him, but continue in the world &amp; of the world, and for them he prayes not.</p>

He could have none to be his own peculiar people, he could have none to be his members unleſs he had them by donation from the Father; For you muſt know that primitively and originally all the world, and all the people in it, are the Fathers.

It is the greateſt reaſon in the world that he that makes a thing ſhould own it too, that it ſhould be his that made it. That he that gives a thing being, ſhould have a title to it, while it hath a being, unleſs he voluntarily and freely make it over to another. But how ſhall Chriſt as he is a Mediator have a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then to be his members, and to make up the Church a body for him, if all originally be the Fathers? Why truly either he muſt create new people, and that as man he cannot do: as God incarnate and manifeſted in the fleſh he is not come to do: or elſe he muſt have ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number, that are already made, from God the Father. And thus the Father is content to yield to him; rather then he ſhould want a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men to be his members, he will ſpare him ſome of his, and others he will keep for other purpoſes to execute his wrath, and manifeſt the glory of his Juſtice on. God will prepare a body of him, and beſtow a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on him, of thoſe that appertain to him: Which is perhaps in part the ſence of that Expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, <hi>When he cometh into the world,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:46169:66"/>
prepared me,</hi> not only a Natural but a Myſtical body.</p>
                  <p>Well then, you ſee, my brethren, how the matter comes about; Chriſt muſt have ſome to be a body and to be a people to him, or wherefore did he take our fleſh upon him, why did he come into the world? As man and Mediator he hath none originally of his own. And therefore God the Father gives him ſome. There are a people for thee, ſaith the Father, thou ſhalt have ſuch and ſuch, and ſuch, <hi>I give them freely to thee that thou maiſt give Eternal life to them.</hi> So many thou ſhalt have among the Jews: and if that be not ſufficient, thou ſhalt have as many more as thou wilt ask among the Gentiles, <hi>Pſal</hi> 2.7. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.</hi> And hence our Saviour ſpeaking of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple acknowledgeth they were his Fathers firſt, and that they came to him by his gift. <hi>Thine they were; They were thine,</hi> though the caſe be altered now, <hi>for thine are mine,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>John</hi> 17.10.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my brethren, that there is a certain company of men,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then in the firſt place here is matter of aſtoniſhment, that God the Father ſhould beſtow upon his Son ſuch a gift as this: that he ſhould have no better thing to give him then a Company of poor wretched loſt creatures, That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould accept of ſuch a gift as this is: truly, my brethren, there is ſo much wonder in it, that it is able to amaze the man that thinks upon it. Why, who are we, that God the Father ſhould think us fit to be made over by a deed of gift to Jeſus Chriſt? What worth is there in us that we ſhould be ſo much as thought upon for ſuch a purpoſe? As if Chriſt ſtood in need of us, as if we might be an addition and advantage to him any way. Whence is it that our Saviour ſhould receive us at his Fathers hands? that he ſhould have the leaſt regard to ſuch poor inconſiderable ſtuff as we are, ſo far as to accept of us? hath he not got a great purchaſe?</p>
                  <p>And yet the Father ſeems to value us ſo far that Jeſus Chriſt is fain ſo ask us too, before he have us: <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thy own poſſeſsion,</hi> otherwiſe I will not. And Chriſt is very well content to ſtoop to this, to begg us a ſpecial boon of God the Father, to become a Suitor to him, that he may have ſuch and ſuch to be his people. Good Father give me ſuch a man or ſuch a woman: I reckon not of others: take them who will for me: but theſe I am deſirous of, and therefore I beſeech thee to beſtow them on me. And having gotten us, he ſeems to glory in us, and to be ſo tender of us, as if we were ſome rich purchaſe, as if we were of very great uſe to him, as you may ſee in this Chapter all along. Sometimes he ſhows the Father what a high eſteem he hath of thoſe whom he hath given him: how carefully he teacheth them, and ſhoweth them all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers name, how tenderly he keeps them, how dearly he affects them, and how his heart is ſet upon them. Sometimes he beggs his Father for them to preſerve them, to ſanctifie them, to make the world know that he loveth them, even as he loveth Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, to make them one among themſelves, and one with him; to bring them to the ſame place where Chriſt is, as if he could not live in Heaven without them. Ah, my beloved, did we follow on this mercy, as far as we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:46169:67"/>
could reach it in our thoughts, we ſhould at length (finding no end or bottom in it) cry out as the Apoſtle, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Are there a certain company of men whom God the Father gives to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Chriſt? then ſurely they that have the happineſs to be of this ſele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted company, are in a very good caſe. It is impoſſible that they ſhould periſh, and that upon a double ground. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, If God the Father give them to his Son Chriſt, you may be ſure that Chriſt will have them; the gift of God the Father ſhall not be in vain to him, he will not loſe his end in this buſineſs. If he give them to his Son, he will ſee his Son ſhall have them. If he beſtow them upon Chriſt to be his members, he will ſee they ſhall, in his appointed time, be joyned to him, and nothing in the world ſhall keep them off from him. It may be many of them who belong to Chriſt, in the eternal Counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, are yet without; but God will ſurely bring them in, in his ſeaſon. Let them be as averſe from Chriſt and from his wayes as it is poſſible for men to be: let them ſtand never ſo far off, the Father who hath given them to Chriſt, will certainly take care that they ſhall come in to him, or elſe his gift were nothing worth. And this is that which Chriſt himſelf takes notice of, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37. <hi>all that the Father giveth to me, ſhall come to me.</hi> Let them be never ſo unwilling of themſelves by nature, let them be never ſo entangled in the ſnare of <hi>Sathan,</hi> ſo mightily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by him, yet however they ſhall come. But what if Chriſt ſhould not receive them when they come? then they may periſh notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Yes, if the Father give them, and cauſe them thereupon to come, Chriſt will certainly receive them, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me.</hi> And what follows? <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If God the Father give them to his Son Chriſt, as you may be confident that Chriſt will have them, ſo may you depend upon it that he will keep them when he hath them. What do you think that Chriſt will loſe that which his Father gives him? That he will not be chary of us for his ſake that beſtowed us on him? We would not loſe the gift of a friend, eſpecially if he be dear to us: and much leſs would we loſe a Fathers gift: we would keep ſuch a thing with all care, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he beſtow it on us with this Condition that we keep it for his ſake; If he tells us that his will and pleaſure is we ſhould not loſe it, we will be very wary how we part with it. Now God hath given us to Chriſt on theſe terms, as he himſelf acknowledges, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39. This is the Fathers will, ſaith he, <hi>That of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> And he came down into this Lower world, <hi>to do the will of him that ſent him,</hi> as he profeſſeth very often; and therefore certainly he will be carefull of this ſpecial charge of his, he will obſerve it very ſtrictly. He will be infinitely wary that he loſe not any of his Fathers things which he hath given him to keep. So that if we be given to the Lord Chriſt, however of our ſelves we are apt to fall away, we may reſolve that he will have us, and keep as unto life eternal.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator hath power to give eternal life to ſuch and all ſuch as are beſtowed upon him by his Father, but he hath no power at all to give this life to any other.</head>
                  <p>The point holds forth both the extent, and limitation of the authority of Jeſus Chriſt, in this reſpect. The former is expreſly mentioned, the latter is apparently inſinuated in my text.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you have here expreſly mentioned the extent of the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator of the Church: It is <hi>that he may give Eternal life to as many as God hath given him.</hi> Be they as many as they will, be they more, or be they leſs, he hath power to quicken them, to raiſe them from the death of ſin to the life of grace and glory. This he can do <hi>de facto,</hi> as he is God, and this he may do <hi>de jure,</hi> as he is God and man, as he is Mediator, to as many as are beſtowed upon him by his Father.</p>
                  <p>And then we have apparently ſuggeſted too, the limitation of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Jeſus Chriſt in this reſpect: For when it is affirmed here that Chriſt hath <hi>power to give Eternal life to as many as God hath given him,</hi> it is implyed that he can give it to no more. There are the bounds of his authority, the reſtraint of his Commiſſion; So far it reaches, and no further. I ſhall endeavour to evince and clear them both in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, hath <hi>power to give eternal life to ſuch,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to all ſuch as are beſtowed upon him by his Father. He hath received commiſſion from his Father, to forgive their ſins and heal their natures, and to become the Prince of Life to them, by giving them the life of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, and the life of Sanctification, and the life of Glorification. He came into the world for this end as you may ſee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life.</hi> They, Who? why, <hi>his ſheep,</hi> as he explains it, both before and after. <hi>I am the door of the ſheep. I am come that they may have life:</hi> and at the 27<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>verſe, My ſheep hear my voice, and I give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them Eternal life.</hi> But how comes Chriſt by theſe ſheep? Why by his Fathers own gift. And therefore it is added in the very next words, <hi>My Father which gave them me, is greater then all.</hi> So that it is as if our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid, I am come down into the world to give life to the ſheep my Father hath beſtowed upon me. To all them, and no others. <hi>The Father loves the Son,</hi> ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>and hath given all things into his hand, John</hi> 3.35. You muſt conceive it, <hi>all things of one ſort</hi> he hath beſtowed upon him, ſo that he hath put them into his hand, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, to keep them, and preſerve them, all his elect and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For <hi>all things of another ſort, he hath</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet,</hi> to ſhame them, and to ruine, and deſtroy them. But what doth Jeſus Chriſt with thoſe his Father gives him in the former way? Why <hi>he beſtows eternal life upon them,</hi> as it is added in the following words, <hi>He that believeth on the Son,</hi> (as they do all, and only they whom God the Father gives him, as before) <hi>hath everlaſting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:46169:68"/>This ſhall ſuffice in brief for confirmation of the former member of the point, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt hath power to give eternal life to all ſuch as are beſtowed upon him by his Father.</hi> The ſecond follows; <hi>He hath no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at all to give this life to any other.</hi> It is not in the power of Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator to ſave a man who is not given him by his Father. If he have not bequeathed them over to the Lord Chriſt, it is beyond the reach of his authority as Mediator to infuſe this life into them. The execution of his power in this regard, you ſee, is confined to ſuch only. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many,</hi> and but as many <hi>as God hath given him. Thou ſhall call his name Ieſus</hi> ſaith the Angel unto <hi>Ioſeph, Mat.</hi> 1.21. <hi>for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins.</hi> Thoſe whom his Father gives him for a people by Election thoſe he is deſigned to ſave, and no others. Our Saviour Chriſt, as he is man is not to chooſe whom he will quicken to the life of Grace and Glory, (For if he had been free in this regard, there is no doubt he would have pitched upon his own Countrey-men, his own Allies, his own Kindred before others; whereas, as the Evangeliſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <hi>he came to his own,</hi> among them he began his Miniſtry, <hi>and his own received him not</hi>) but he muſt take ſuch as his Father chooſes, and gives him to be quickned by him. Thoſe whom his Father gives him, only thoſe and all thoſe, he muſt keep and raiſe up and give them everlaſting life, as you may ſee, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.39.40.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee as Mediator Chriſt hath no power to give Eternal life to any but thoſe who are beſtowed upon him by his Father.</p>

                     </label> And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe as Mediator he is ſent out by the Father; he is the Fathers Miniſter, the Fathers Servant: ſo he calls him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant whom I uphold.</hi> And ſervants are to do their Maſters will, and not their own. No doubt the will of Jeſus Chriſt as he was man, would have carried him to ſave thoſe whom his Father and himſelf as God had appointed to deſtruction. But he muſt ſtood in this to the will of him that ſent him; he muſt be ſatisfied with thoſe his Father hath appointed for him to become a people to him. It is to be conſidered that the Father having called him <hi>Servant,</hi> ſpeaks of him ſo as one that would in every thing be ordered by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.18. which is indeed a Parallel of that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant whom I have choſen</hi> (ſpeaking of our Saviour Chriſt) <hi>he ſhall ſhew judgement to the Gentiles, he ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry, neither ſhall any hear his voice in the ſtreet. A bruiſed read ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax he ſhall not quench.</hi> This and this he ſhall do, and this he ſhall not do, ſaith God the Father; he is my ſervant, and I will order him at my pleaſure: And ſo our Saviour Chriſt himſelf profeſſeth upon all occaſions, that he will be obedient to his Father, and that he can do nothing otherwiſe then he will have him. And hence it is that he can quicken none but thoſe that are beſtowed upon him by his Father to be quickned by him.</p>
                  <p>It is not that he hath not power as he is God <hi>to quicken whom he will,</hi> as his own Expreſſion is, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.21. In this reſpect he is <hi>equall to his Father.</hi> For as <hi>the Father raiſeth up the dead, and quickneth them, ſo the Son quickneth whom he will.</hi> It's act that he hath not in himſelf enough of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:46169:68"/>
or enough of Spirit to raiſe up all the people in the world, to the life of grace and glory. It is not that his grace is not ſufficient to ſubdue and overcome the greateſt obſtinacy and rebellion in the hearts and wills of men, the moſt extream indiſpoſition: though they be as <hi>dry tones,</hi> yet he can <hi>gather them together, and make them to ſtand up and live:</hi> but it is becauſe as Mediator he is a ſervant to the Father, and muſt do his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will, and he will have him give this life to none but thoſe whom he makes over to him by a deed of gift to be his members, <hi>whom he elects in him,</hi> as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Our Saviour puts all this together, in that place ſo often cited, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37, 38. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and I will raiſe them up, and give them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life,</hi> as afterwards, all them, and only them. And why ſo? For <hi>I came down from heaven not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> My own will, as I am man, would carry me to give life to a greater number, but I am come to do <hi>my Fathers will,</hi> and not my own. And therefore I muſt be content with thoſe whom he is pleaſed to allot to me, to quicken them, and make them living members of my body my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical, and no others. And this for clearing of the obſervation. Proceed we to the Application, according to the branches of the point in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is it ſo, that Ieſus Chriſt hath power to give eternal life to all that are <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> beſtowed upon him by his Father?</hi> This then may ſerve to comfort us, at leaſt to keep our hearts from ſinking with reference to thoſe who yet are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> It may be ſome of them are near us in the fleſh, they are our parents, or they are our Children, or they are our kindred and acquaintance: they are it may be in our beds, and in our boſoms, and when we look on ſuch dead ſouls, our bowels even turn within us, we pitty them, and melt upon them. They have been in their graves ſo long, and Chriſt hath called ſo long upon them in the preaching of the Goſpel, and yet <hi>they come not forth</hi> to this day. There have ſo many powerfull and effectual means been uſed in vain, that we are out of hope of them, and this even breaks our very hearts with ſorrow. Why my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it may be they belong to Jeſus Chriſt in the eternal Counſel and decree of God; they are beſtowed upon him by the Father in electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though yet they are not given to him by real union, and incorporation. And if they appertain to Jeſus Chriſt, though they be never ſo untoward and indiſpoſed and averſe, depend upon it, <hi>he hath power to give Eternal life to them;</hi> I ſay to every one of you, my brethren, that hath ſuch a wife, or ſuch a husband, or ſuch a child, or ſuch a friend, as Chriſt to <hi>Martha,</hi> when he had told her that he was <hi>the reſurrection and the life,</hi> that he could raiſe up any man, though he were dead, and make him live, <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.26. <hi>Believeſt thou this?</hi> It may be you will ſay, as ſhe: Alas, my Brother, or my Father, or my Child hath been dead ſo many dayes, ſo many years, he hath laid buried in his grave of ſin a long while, ſo that <hi>by this time he ſtinketh.</hi> Why yet believe that Jeſus Chriſt can <hi>raiſe him up,</hi> and make him live the life of grace and glory. He hath received power to give eternal life to all that are beſtowed upon him. If they belong to that number, be they as dead as it is poſſible for men to be, and as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:46169:69"/>
averſe from being quickned, the power of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall maſter them, and overcome them, and raiſe them up out of their graves of ſin: that you ſhall ſay with admiration, See what Ieſus Chriſt can do upon a poor dead Creature! And therefore when you look upon ſuch ſouls as thoſe, and ſeem to have the queſtion put you that the Prophet had, when he ſaw the dry bones, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.3. <hi>Can theſe dead ſouls live?</hi> do you give the ſame anſwer, <hi>O Lord God thou knowſt.</hi> If they belong to Ieſus Chriſt, he hath power enough to raiſe them, and he will ſurely do it in his own time.</p>

                     <hi>Is it ſo that Ieſus Chriſt hath power to give eternal life to all that,</hi> &amp;c. This then ſhould teach us two things. Firſt, Not to be lifted up upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of our high condition; and Secondly, Not to be caſt down upon the contemplation of our low condition in the world. You ſee the men who are to have this life from Chriſt, are not deſcribed to be <hi>of ſuch a quality, of ſuch a ſtation or condition,</hi> but only to be <hi>given to him by the Father.</hi> So that let them be what they will, in all conſiderations and reſpects beſides, if God have given them to Chriſt, they ſhall aſſuredly have life from him. <hi>He hath received power for this End, that he ſhould give,</hi> &amp;c. So that it matters not in this reſpect whether we be high, or low, rich or poor, bond or free, we are not any whit the nearer to the life of Chriſt, my brethren, for the one, nor any whit the further from it for the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Be not lifted up upon the contemplation of your high Condition in the world. Admit that you be wealthy, admit that you be noble, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, honourable, and the like, admit that you be any way advanced, and raiſed above your brethren, you have no cauſe at all to ſwell with theſe prerogatives, or to be proud of theſe things. Indeed they have their uſe and worth, and therefore are not utterly to be contemned; but yet we muſt withal conſider that be their excellency what it will, they are of no avail at all, to bring us to the life of grace and glory. In that which is the point of higheſt conſequence, matter of life and death, yea of eternal life and death, they will not ſteed us in the <hi>leaſt</hi> degree; and therefore certainly there is no cauſe at all why they ſhould be ſo magnified, and admired as they are. If outward wealth and pomp, or dignity did further us: if outward baſeneſs did hinder us in this buſineſs, how is it that the baſe things of this world and things that are deſpiſed are choſen? and that the <hi>poor</hi> in purſe as well as ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, do receive the word of life? when yet <hi>not many mighty, not many noble in the world are called,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25. If outward wiſdom, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, policy did further, or weakneſs or unlearnedneſs did hinder us in point of having life from Chriſt, how is it that the <hi>weak and fooliſh things</hi> are choſen many times, and that the <hi>Law of God gives underſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> that <hi>the unlearned riſe, and take the kingdom as it were by force,</hi> that is, with earneſtneſs and with affection: when yet <hi>not many wiſe, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men are called?</hi> Why are we ſo exalted upon theſe outward priviledges and preferments in the world? What is it that you ſtand upon? What, that which will promote or further you to life Eternal? Alas they are of no avail in this reſpect. All theſe prerogatives with which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:46169:69"/>
men ſwell even till they burſt again, are ſuch as they may carry with them into Hell.</p>
                  <p>Let us not be caſt down upon the contemplation of our low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world. You that are ſimple, poor and mean, that have not any outward thing to glory in, no wealth, no parts, no honour, or preferment any way: be not dejected and diſheartened; for as external priviledges and advancements are of no avail to further you, ſo outward means and abaſure is of no avail to hinder you from receiving life from Chriſt. <hi>He gives it to as many as God hath given him,</hi> let them be of what condition or eſtate they will. There is no other thing required in this reſpect, but that they <hi>be beſtowed upon him by the Father.</hi> And he beſtows upon him poor and weak men many times: yea, moſt times. And therefore be not out of heart; for hadſt thou all the wealth and honour in the world, thou wert not any whit the nearer to this life of Chriſt, nor art thou any whit the further from it by thy low condition: That will be no impediment, but that he may give thee life; the life of grace in this world, and the life of glory in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt hath no authority to give Eternal life to any but thoſe who are beſtowed upon him by his Father?</hi> They are miſtaken then, who <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> hold that he came into the world to give life to all men. He came as you have heard to do his Fathers will, and this is his Fathers will, that <hi>he ſhould give Eternal life to as many as he hath given him,</hi> and not to a man more. This he hath given him authority and power to do: further then this his Commiſſion doth not reach. So that it is not in the power of Jeſus Chriſt to quicken all and ſave all, it is apparent that he cannot do it. Indeed as God he can do all things but thoſe that are <hi>impoſsible;</hi> Either <hi>abſolutely</hi> being ſuch as are not to be done; or elſe <hi>impoſsible upon condition,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a contrary Decree, by which he hath confined-himſelf. But as man and Mediator, he can do no more then God will have him, he can ſave no more then God <hi>hath given him,</hi> and put into his hands to ſave. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall find it in his ſtory, that <hi>as man</hi> he was extreamly troubled at the unbelief and hardneſs of the peoples hearts. <hi>He wept over Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> with many tears: Why, you will ſay, perhaps what needed this? he might have wrought upon them, and put the life of Grace into them. No my Beloved, he could not work on many of them; he could not raiſe them to the life of Grace, they were not <hi>given him by his Father,</hi> and yet <hi>as man</hi> he pittied and lamented their condition, as we ſhould do in ſuch a caſe, he being <hi>in all things like unto us, ſin only excepted.</hi> And this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould <hi>melt</hi> the hearts of Reprobates themſelves to Chriſt, and make them to relent towards him. Alas, he pitties you, and mourns over you, his very bowels yearn towards you, He delights not in your ruin and deſtruction; No, it is troubleſome and grievous to him. <hi>But why then doth he not relieve and help us,</hi> you will ſay? Why, if you be not <hi>given him by the Father,</hi> it is not in his power to do it. Its ſaid indeed that <hi>he gives life unto the world,</hi> as it is in his own expreſſion, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.33. But that is but in oppoſition to the Jews; not to the Jews alone, but to the world, to men of all conditions, and of all Nations in the world. But to the world in general he doth not, nay, he cannot give it. So that the fault
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:46169:70"/>
is not in him, if any of you periſh, and that you have not life from him; you ſee he is confined and bound up by his Father to a <hi>certain number,</hi> to give this life, but <hi>to as many as the Father gives him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But what is Eternal Life? what is there comprehended under that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion?

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Explication of that which is delivered in the former verſe, in which our Saviour ſhews expreſly what he intendeth by <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> and wherein it conſiſts, <hi>in the Knowledge of the Father and the Son,</hi> or <hi>of the Father in the Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall take notice only of theſe two Particulars, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>thing</hi> explained, and the <hi>way</hi> of Explication. The <hi>thing</hi> explained is <hi>life Eternal.</hi> As for the <hi>way</hi> of Explication, he doth not ſhew you <hi>quare ſit,</hi> why this <hi>life Eternal</hi> is, he doth not open and unfold it by the Cauſes of it; I ſay he doth not here, though he doth in other places, but he ſhews you <hi>quid ſit,</hi> what this <hi>Eternal life</hi> is. This ſaith he, <hi>is Life, Eternal life.</hi> This is it; <hi>what is it?</hi> why, it conſiſts you ſee in holy Knowledge, which is ſet forth both by the Act and Object of it. The Act, that <hi>they might know.</hi> The Object of it, <hi>God the Father, the only true God, and Chriſt the Son, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent. This is life Eternal, that they might know thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What then? Doth there go nothing elſe to <hi>life Eternal</hi> but the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Father and the Son?</hi> Doth it conſiſt in this, and this only? This is a ſcruple that is very variouſly reſolved by thoſe that write upon the Text. Some think that <hi>knowledge</hi> here is put for <hi>faith,</hi> by which we live the life of Grace, which is <hi>Eternal,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>The life which I live, I live by the faith of the Son of God.</hi> And ſo it is, as if our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>this is Eternal life,</hi> ſo to <hi>know</hi> as to <hi>believe in thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others conceive that <hi>life Eternal</hi> here importeth nothing elſe but the way to <hi>Eternal life,</hi> the ready path that leads to it: And that our Saviour ſhews us here how he brings thoſe to <hi>life Eternal,</hi> who are beſtowed upon him by his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> by giving them the ſaving Knowledge of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf; That <hi>he ſhould give Eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. And this is life Eternal,</hi> this is the way to it, that <hi>they might
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:46169:70"/>
know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As far as I can apprehend, the ſcruple might be cleared beſt by a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Eternal life</hi> is either Inchoate, or conſummate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternal life Conſummate</hi> conſiſts eſpecially in the compleat and perfect knowledge of God, which Schoolmen all <hi>Beatifical viſion.</hi> And hence our Saviour Chriſt himſelf ſets forth our happineſs, of which we ſhall be made partakers in the world to come, by this, that there we ſhall ſee God. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God,</hi> that is, we ſhall know God, as knowledge ordinarily is ſet forth by the ſenſe of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Scripture. Yea, we ſhall know him clearly and diſtinctly, <hi>we ſhall ſee him face to face.</hi> And this is that which the Apoſtle makes the main of the Beatitude and glory prepared for the Saints at the time of Chriſts appearing, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is:</hi> now we ſee him as we can, <hi>then we ſhall ſee him as he is: we ſhall know him as we are known,</hi> viz. <hi>of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. We ſhall know God, even as God knows us. As we are known of God diſtinctly, clearly, perfectly, ſo we ſhall know God. He knows us perfectly according to his nature now, and we ſhall know him perfectly according to our nature then, as far as our created nature is capable of. So we ſhall <hi>know as we are known:</hi> for <hi>as</hi> there is a note of Similitude and not of Equality. And this ſhall be our happineſs in Heaven, and our glorious life there, that we ſhall ſee the very face of God, and not his <hi>back parts</hi> only as we have done in this world. That we ſhall have him fully and compleatly. So that <hi>this is Eternal life</hi> (you ſee) conſummate in the Heavens, <hi>to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as I take it, the <hi>life Eternal</hi> mentioned in my Text, is that of which the Saints are made partakers in this preſent life, and which our Saviour gives them here in this world. As in another place he tells us, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I give unto them Eternal life.</hi> He doth not ſay, I will give them Eternal life hereafter, but I give it them for preſent, and therefore it is added in the words immediatly annexed, <hi>neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hands, Iohn</hi> 10.27, 28. And this I do, this <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life I give them,</hi> by teaching and inſtructing them, and making them to <hi>hear my voyce:</hi> as who ſhould ſay, by working knowledge in them, <hi>My ſheep hear my voyce,</hi> and by this means <hi>I give unto them Eternal life.</hi> And this Expreſſion in my Text looks much the ſame way. As thou haſt <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him power ever all fleſh, that he ſhould give Eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. And this is life Eternal to know thee the true God,</hi> and ſo on.</p>
               <p>This is the way to give them life Eternal, by making them to know thee. And this I have begun to do already, as he addeth afterwards, <hi>I have made known thy Name</hi> (that is) thy Nature and thy Attributes to the men which thou haſt given me. So that this <hi>life Eternal</hi> here is not, or not ſo much that which is perfect and Conſummate in the Heavens, as that which is begun in this world, and which the Saints are made partakers of while they are here: for even here they have <hi>Eternal life abiding in them.</hi> And this, this inchoate <hi>Eternal life</hi> conſiſts eſpecially in ſaving knowledge. <hi>This is Eternal life, this is it in the beginning, to know thee the only true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So that the Point to be obſerved is this;</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eternal, is begun in holy Knowledge.</head>
                  <p>Chriſt <hi>gives Eternal life</hi> to us at leaſt in the beginning of it, when (as the Prophet of his Church) he teaches us, and cauſes us to know his Father and himſelf. When he makes known his Fathers Name, and his own Name to us, he cauſes <hi>us to paſs from death to life. In him was life</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi>) 1 John 4. <hi>and the life was the light of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Life communicated to the ſons of men, was the Light of ſaving knowledge which he made to ſhine into them. He <hi>gave them life,</hi> in that he <hi>gave them light and knowledge,</hi> who were before in darkneſs, and ſo by Conſequence <hi>in the ſhadow of death,</hi> as the Scripture phraſe is. And hence ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Awake and riſe up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee Light,</hi> Eph. 5.14. Indeed, as long as we are ignorant and in the dark, we are all dead men, we know not what the life of God means: And therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the life of God.</hi> They live the life of men indeed, but they were <hi>ſtrangers from the life of God, the life of Grace,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Ignorance and blindneſs that was in them,</hi> Eph. 4 18. <hi>The Grace of God is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>who hath aboliſhed death.</hi> But how hath he done this? <hi>by bringing life and Immortality to light;</hi> as it is added in the next words, <hi>by bringing life and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>ortality.</hi> The latter as I take it, is the Explication of the former. <hi>q. d.</hi> by bringing ſuch a Life as is immortal, as is above the power of Death, as the life of Grace is; By bringing this to men, by ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on them with the bright and glorious light and luſtre of the Goſpel: I might be very copious here, but this may ſatisfie to clear the Point, <hi>That life Eternal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this appeareth further divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>It will appear that <hi>life Eternal,</hi> or the life of Grace which is <hi>Eternal,</hi> is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> begun in holy knowledge, if we conſider what it is that is the great Impediment of Life, and what it is that holds men, and detains men in a ſtate of Death. It is apparently their want of knowledge, the ignorance and errour that is in them. How came ſin, and with it death into the world, but by cozenage and deceit? The <hi>woman being deceived</hi> was in the <hi>tranſgreſsion;</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 Tim. 2.14. She fell into it by a meer cheat. And how are men continued in this ſtate of ſin and death? <hi>They are corrupt according to deceitful luſts,</hi> Eph. 4, 22. Look as their luſts deceive them more or leſs, ſo are they more or leſs corrupt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that ſit in darkneſs, are ſaid to fit in the <hi>ſhadow of death.</hi> And which way then ſhall life Eternal be begun in men, but by diſpelling this darkneſs by the light of holy Knowledge, and by <hi>tranſlating men out of the power of darkneſs,</hi> as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.14. Out of ignorance and darkneſs which hath ſuch a power upon them to hold them under ſin and death, and to keep them ſtill in a condition of <hi>eſtrangement from the life of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates in the cited place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.18. If it be <hi>ignorance</hi> that keeps men from the life of Grace, then ſurely it is <hi>holy
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:46169:71"/>
Knowledge</hi> that begins it, and that brings men to it.</p>
                  <p>It will appear that the life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is begun in holy Knowledge, if you conſider who it is that is the principal Efficient of it, and the way which he works it. The Principal Efficient of this Life is Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore he is called <hi>our Life</hi> very often in the Scripture. And he is ſaid to give it in the words which I have finiſhed, that he ſhould <hi>give Eternal life.</hi> And which way doth he give it to his people, but by working knowledge in them? And therefore it is added in my Text, <hi>This is Eternal life</hi> (this is the life which he gives) <hi>to know thee the true God.</hi> Indeed he gives it to us as a Prophet; he purchaſes and gets it for us I acknowledge, as a Prieſt, by his Invaluable ſatisfaction. But he begets and works it in us, by his effectual Teaching and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a Prophet: And therefore he is ſaid to ſpeak in life to his people, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.63. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are Life.</hi> To ſhew us that he <hi>quickens</hi> us in a way of Information; for to what End doth ſpeaking tend, but to make us underſtand? <hi>Thou haſt the words of eternal life,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.68. That is, the words that work life; and which way can they work it, but by conveying knowledge to the mind of him that hears them? So that you ſee that Jeſus Chriſt is the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Cauſe of the life of Grace in his people, by teaching them, by working ſaving knowledge in them, by <hi>turning them from darkneſs to light.</hi> He gets it for them as a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> He gives it to them as a <hi>King,</hi> He works it in them as a <hi>Prophet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It will appear that <hi>life Eternal</hi> is begun in holy Knowledge, Becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Inſtrumental means of Life is the means of knowledge to. Yea, it is the means of Life, in that it is the means of Knowledge. The Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal means of Life you know (my Brethren) is the Goſpel. And therefore it is called <hi>the word of Life, Phil.</hi> 2.16. <hi>holding forth the word of Life, that is the Goſpel &amp; the Miniſtry of life,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.7. in oppoſition to the Law, which is the <hi>Miniſtry of death and condemnation.</hi> And which way doth the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel work life, but by inſtilling knowledge into men, by making them to underſtand that which they never knew before, that they are naturally <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> that they are in a ſtate of death and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that there is life enough in Jeſus Chriſt, that he is ready to diſpenſe and give it out to all that come to him for it? And ſo convincing them that it is neceſſary for them to go to him that they may have Life; Till they come to know this there is no life of Grace in them. And it is by Goſpel-Teaching that this life is infuſed into them.</p>
                  <p>It will appear unto you that the life of Grace is begun in holy Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> if you conſider with what part the Lord begins, when he puts this Life into us. He begins not with the members, he begins not with the will, but he begins with the mind and underſtanding, by Illuminating that, and by endewing that with ſaving knowledge; And therefore we are ſaid to be <hi>transformed,</hi> or to be <hi>changed</hi> from the ſtate or life of nature to the ſtate or life of Grace, by the <hi>renewing of the mind,</hi> Rom. 12.2. No doubt the will and members are renewed too, for the <hi>change</hi> is univerſal. But there the work begins my Brethren, in the mind and underſtanding, we are <hi>renewed</hi> firſt in the <hi>ſpirit of the mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. and from that it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:46169:72"/>
goes on to the inferiour faculties, and to the outward converſation. And conſequently it begins in knowledge, of which the mind is capable, which is the proper object of it. And therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them with thy Truth,</hi> Renew them, make them holy, work the life of Grace in them by revealing Truth to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is apparent that the life of Grace begins in Knowledge, becauſe all other grace is brought into the ſoul by it, and therefore this muſt be the firſt Grace. The firſt I mean in order, and in courſe of nature, not of time. As long as there is no knowledge, there is no grace at all, and ſo no Life in ſuch a perſon. But when knowledge once comes in, I ſpeak of ſanctified Knowledge, it brings all ſaving Grace with it; This is the prime work of Grace and the Foundation of the reſt. The <hi>New man is renewed in Knowledge,</hi> Col. 3.10. why ſo it is in Faith, and Love, and other graces. But it is firſt renewed in knowledge, there is the riſe &amp; the original of all. And even as in the firſt, the old Creation, the Lord began with natural Light, <hi>Gen,</hi> 1.3. ſo in the ſecond or the New Creation, he begins with ſpiritual Light, with ſuper-natural and ſaving Knowledge; and gives us other graces by this means. To which effect is the Apoſtles prayer, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Grace be multiplyed upon you through the knowledge of God:</hi> and after more expreſly to our purpoſe, <hi>As he hath given us all things that pertain to life and godlineſs, through the knowledge of him.</hi> So that we have this Life, the life of holineſs and grace, through knowledge; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we have no Grace, but with it all Grace. It is the ſeed from whence all other graces grow; it is the means by which they are begotten in the ſoul. Holy Knowledge will bring forth heavenly Affections and deſires. If a man know God, and know Chriſt, his will ſhall cloſe with him, and his affections ſhall be carried out to him: it will effectually reſtrain a man from ſin and reform the Converſation. <hi>They ſhall not hurt, neither deſtroy in all my holy Mountain</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.9. And why ſo? <hi>for the earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord.</hi> If you have been taught by him, <hi>as the Truth is in Jeſus,</hi> why then you will <hi>put off the old man.</hi> It will draw a man to practice and obedience, if it be ſound and ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; as holy <hi>David</hi> intimates in that requeſt of his, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.34. <hi>Give me underſtanding,</hi> ſaith he, And what then? why, <hi>I ſhall keep thy Law,</hi> yea, <hi>I ſhall obſerve it with my whole heart.</hi> So that you ſee, all holineſs and Grace is brought into the ſoul by Knowledge: and therefore certainly the life of Grace begins in it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Now is it ſo, that life Eternal, or the life of Grace which is Eternal, is begun in holy Knowledge? This then may ſerve to teach us in the firſt place, how to value Knowledge, and what account and eſtimate to put upon it. Why truly, as we value life, yea everlaſting Life, ſo we ought to value Knowledge at the very ſame rate: <hi>For this is life Eternal to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi> We all of us do make a very great account even of our temporary Lives, which yet when all is done muſt periſh and decay, and come ro nothing; we are ready to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them, if there be no other way, with the loſs of all things elſe. Though yet even then when all is done, we know we can enjoy them but a few years, and are not certain to enjoy them one hour. How is it then
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:46169:72"/>
that we deſpiſe and undervalue holy Knowledge in which Eternal life conſiſts, which if we can attain, we have Eternal life abiding in us, a life which is above the power of death and diſſolution: Alas, how miſerably is it ſlighted by the greater part of men, yea by the greater part of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans! Chriſtians I mean, in name and in profeſſion. Though it be offered them, they will not take it, but ſay in effect to God, Depart from us, for we will not have the knowledge of thy wayes. When light is tendered them, they even ſhut their eyes againſt it that they may not ſee. So that it may be ſaid of ſuch, as God complains of ſome in <hi>Iſrael: their eyes have they cloſed, leſt they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and underſtand with their hearts, and be converted, and be healed.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> charge muſt needs fall home upon them, <hi>they are wilfully ignorant.</hi> They enjoy the means of Knowledge, but they will not wait upon them, they take no care at all to profit by them. They need not to aſcend up into <hi>heaven to bring Chriſt down from above, nor to deſcend into the deep, to bring up Chriſt again from the dead,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.6. that they may be acquainted with him; the word is <hi>nigh them,</hi> as it is added there in that place. The Word that manifeſteth and revealeth God and Chriſt, <hi>is nigh to them.</hi> They need not to go far to hear it, and to hear of God in it. But many will not ſpend an hour, they will not ſtep without their doors to meet with God, and to be acquainted with him: as if the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord were worth nothing, as if it were of no value; Ah, my Beloved, do you know what it is that you deſpiſe, and ſet at nought in this faſhion? Is life worth any thing? Is life Eternal worth any thing? Why in contemning Knowledge, you contemn no leſs then this; for this, as you have heard, <hi>is life Eternal.</hi> And how deſervedly may you be left to periſh in Eternal Death, who put the means of knowiedge from you, and judge your ſelves unworthy of Eternal life!</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that life Eternal, or the life of Grace, which is Eternal, is begun <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> in holy Knowledge?

They are ſo far from being quickened to this life of Grace, that they are meer ſtrangers to it.

                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:46169:75"/>I know it is a Common fancy, that if a man profeſs the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if he have been baptized, and come to the Aſſemblies, and hear and pray as others do, he is in a good Condition; but be aſſured of this, if he be ignorant of God and Jeſus Chriſt <hi>whom he hath ſent,</hi> he is no better then a dead man. It is a cooling word my Brethren, and that which one would think ſhould aſtoniſh and amaze you; Suppoſe a Meſſenger ſhould come to any of you from them that have the power of life and death, and with a ſerious and compoſed look ſhould tell him that he is a dead man, how would it ſtrike him to the heart? how would his colour come and go? how would the powers of his ſoul tremble? Now we are Meſſengers diſpatched from him who hath the Keyes of Hell and Death, to tell you who are ignorant of God and Chriſt, that you are in a ſtate of death and condemnation, and that you are in danger every hour of being caſt into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond Death. It may be you will take no notice of it, but chaſe away the meditation of it from your thoughts. You will (as many do) delude your ſelves with this conceit, that though you die in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet God notwithſtanding will be merciful to you. But as you tender the ſalvation of your precious ſouls, I beſeech you to obſerve that Gods own Word is peremptory and expreſs for this. That none that is devoid of knowledge, and continues ſo, ſhall have any ſhare in the mercy of God, or in the glory of the world to come. <hi>Oh continue thy loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them that know thee,</hi> (to them and none but them,) ſaith <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 36.10. <hi>It is a people of no underſtanding,</hi> ſaith the Prophet of the <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 27.11. And what follows? <hi>Therefore he that made them will not have mercy upon them.</hi> It is the common apprehenſion of the vulgar ſort that he that made them cannot chuſe but ſave them too. No, ſaith the Prophet there, if they be groſly ignorant, <hi>Then God that made them will have no mercy upon them. They have not known my wayes,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>unto whom I ſwore in my wrath, that they ſhould never enter into my reſt. The time is coming when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendring vengeance unto them that know not God.</hi> And therefore I beſeech you do not ſlight it, but lay it ſeriouſly to heart, while yet the pardon may be gotten, while the condemnatory ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which the Law hath put againſt you, may be yet revoked.</p>

You ſee then what you are to do, and what courſe you are to take, if you would live Eternally. Originally we are all dead men, we are in a condition and a ſtate of death.

                  <p>But you will ask me, which way ſhall we come to know God, and know Chriſt? To this I anſwer, that you cannot know him by innate and in-bred light, by any ſelf-ability, let it be what it will, it is incompetent and inſufficient to reveal God to you: though much of him be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Book of the Creation, his <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> his <hi>eternal power and God-head,</hi> and though there be <gap reason="foreign">

No, neither can you know him ſo by ſtudying in the Book of Scriptures neither, though there he be revealed more fully then he is in the book of Creatures, unleſs ſome other help go with it; Nay more then ſo, you cannot know him fully and compleatly any way by any means in this life. As he is in himſelf, he is not to be known of any but himſelf. And hence t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Scripture tells us, <hi>that no man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> John 1.18. It is very full you ſee, no <hi>man at any time</hi> But though he doth not, yet he may. No, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. <hi>He dwells in light that no man can approach unto,</hi> whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee. Indeed we ſee him <hi>darkly</hi> here, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. And therefore this is called <hi>the ſeeing of the back-parts</hi> of the Lord. As when we ſee the back-parts of a man, we know him but by gueſs only, we know him not ſo perfectly and diſtinctly as when we come to ſee his face. Such a ſight of God is that which we attain in this life. And however it may ſeem by ſome expreſſion in the Scripture, that God hath fully manifeſted and made known himſelf to ſome here, as to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32.30. and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Num. 12.8. <hi>To him will I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>by viſion, not in darkneſs, and he ſhall ſee the ſimilitude of God.</hi> This muſt be underſtood comparatively of the Lords more clear and full revealing of himſelf to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to <hi>Moſes,</hi> then to other men. But as for perfect light and knowledge of the Lord, my Brethren, this was not imparted, neither to <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor to <hi>Moſes. Thou ſhalt not ſee my face,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33.10. That is, the fulneſs of my glory: <hi>for none ſhall ſee my face and live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But which way may we come to know him, ſo far as he is to be known in this life?</p>
                  <p>Truly there is but one way of coming to the knowledge of him, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this <hi>way</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Evangeliſt, Ioh.</hi> 1.18. What then, is he not to be ſeen, not to be known at all, by any means? Yes, though he be not to be ſeen or known immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in himſelf, yet mediately in and by the Son he may be known; for he hath <hi>manifeſted</hi> and <hi>revealed him to us. No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him.</hi> And therefore when our Saviour was Incarnate, it is ſaid, <hi>that God was manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. In which reſpect it is, that when <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo earneſt to have the Father ſhewn him, our Saviour bids him <hi>to behold himſelf,</hi> and addeth preſently, <hi>he that hath ſeen me, hath
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:46169:76"/>
ſeen the Father alſo.</hi> Indeed it was the buſineſs of our Saviour Chriſt into this Lower world, to bring God down to us, that we might be acquainted with him: And therefore if you do indeed deſire to know him, go to Chriſt, and uſe his help in this buſineſs. If you ever ſee God, and have that knowledge of him, <hi>which is life Eternal,</hi> you muſt have light from Jeſus Chriſt to ſee him by. <hi>I am the light of the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Ioh</hi> 8.12. <hi>without me</hi> there is no light in all the world, none but that which <hi>comes from me,</hi> and which <hi>I am the Fountain of. He that follows me ſhall have the light of Life,</hi> that is the <hi>light which is life.</hi> And therefore if you would have this light follow Jeſus Chriſt for it, and follow him three wayes, or in the uſe eſpecially of three Means: follow him in a Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a Goſpel grace, a Goſpel-duty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Follow him in the Goſpel-ordinance of preaching; there it is that Chriſt <hi>ſhines,</hi> that he gives out the <hi>light,</hi> by which he <hi>ſhews</hi> his Father to his people. Its true indeed that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed him in the Law as a Judge and an Avenger. But it is Jeſus Chriſt that <hi>ſhews</hi> him in the Goſpel as a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Saviour.</hi> He is not manifeſt in a ſaving way anywhere but in the Goſpel. The Knowledge of him as he is diſcovered there, and none but that <hi>is life eternal.</hi> And therefore wait on that diſcovery, if you mean to live for ever; where there is any Goſpel-preaching, ſay Chriſt ſhews his Father there, and follow him, that ſo you may have life by this means. I ſay as <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Take faſt hold of Inſtruction, keep her, for ſhe is thy life.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Follow him in a Goſpel-grace, and that is faith; by this it is that we come to <hi>ſee God,</hi> and <hi>know God;</hi> as by it we believe the Revelations and Diſcoveries that are made of God, which other men may read and hear, and yet becauſe they have no faith to give belief and credit to them, they get no ſight, no knowledge of the Lord by them. It is by <hi>faith</hi> that <hi>we ſee</hi> him who is <hi>inviſible,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.27. There are ſome things that muſt be firſt believed before they can be fully underſtood: if you believe them not, you can never underſtand them. And hence ſaith the Apoſtle in the third <hi>ver.</hi> of the fore-cited Chapter, <hi>by ſaith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the world to be created by the word of God.</hi> A man would think he would have ſaid, by faith we credit and believe it, and not by faith we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. But the Creation is a thing that is above Philoſophy: and therefore is not to be fully underſtood, unleſs it be believed firſt. It is our faith that helps us to the perfect Knowledge of it, and ſo by faith we <hi>ſee</hi> and <hi>know God,</hi> becauſe by faith we give aſſent to the diſcoveries that are made of God in Scripture; and having once believed them, we come to ſee and underſtand the nature of the Lord in them. We ſee the Lord in his All-mightineſs, his All-ſufficiency, his Omni-preſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which a man that hath not faith can neuer do: we bring him near us, by believing his Immenſity, and that he filleth <hi>all places,</hi> (as he is ſaid to do in Scripture) we look upon him now as juſt by us, and ſo we have a clear and diſtinct ſight of him.</p>

               <p>AND thus far of the thing Explained, and that as you have heard, is <hi>life Eternal,</hi> together with the way of Explication: our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhews not <hi>quare ſit,</hi> but <hi>quid ſit,</hi> what this life Eternal is? This ſaith he <hi>is life Eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> So that as you have heard, it conſiſts in holy Knowledge.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to look a little more particularly and diſtinctly on the Knowledge in which Eternal life conſiſts, as it is here deſcribed by the Object of it, God and Chriſt, <hi>Thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here is a double Object of the Knowledge mentioned, and each of them is ſet forth by a Title and an Attribute. The Title of the former <hi>God,</hi> the Attribute <hi>the true God,</hi> yea, <hi>the only true God.</hi> The Title of the latter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Attribute <hi>whom God hath ſent. Thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here the firſt thing that I ſhall obſerve, is, the communication of this double Object of the Knowledge wherein Eternal life conſiſts, <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> You ſee my Brethren, they are cloſely knit together by the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:46169:77"/>
conjunctive particle <hi>And,</hi> to ſhew us that they may not be divided in this great buſineſs. That it is not ſufficient to ſalvation to believe in God, unleſs we believe in Chriſt to. To know God, unleſs we know Chriſt too. Our Saviour ſaith not, this is life Eternal to know the only true God; no, he doth not ſtop there. The knowledge which proceeds no further, will never bring a man to life Eternal. There is another Object of this ſaving Knowledge, which muſt with all be jointly apprehended by us if we mean to live for ever, and that is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom God hath ſent.</hi> And then my Brethren, if we take them both together, we are right, It is impoſſible that we ſhould periſh. <hi>This is life Eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Not thee alone, but thee and Chriſt. So that the Point to be obſerved is this;</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The Knowledge which is life Eternal, in which Eternal life conſiſts, is the Knowledge both of God and Chriſt too, not of the former only, but the latter alſo.</head>
                  <p>You ſee my Brethren, both of them are jointly made the Object of it in my Text. So that the Knowledge which neglecteth either of them, is in-ſufficient to ſalvation. If it ſtay and reſt on God, and go not on to Jeſus Chriſt, it will never reach home. This only, <hi>this is life Eternal, to know God and Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> not divided, but together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is true, that it is abſolutely neceſſary to Eternal life to know God; The ignorant of him are made the Objects of a dreadful Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.25. Yea, more then ſo, the ignorant among the heathen who were deprived of the means (though not of all, yet) of the ſaving Knowledge of him: and yet as you may ſee the Prophet prayes, <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not.</hi> Indeed, the men that have their <hi>underſtandings darkened</hi> by reaſon of their ignorance of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have means or none, are <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. They do not live the life of Grace in this world, nor ſhall they live the life of Glory in the world to come. And <hi>the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, rendring vengeance unto them that know not God,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.7. So that without the knowledge of him, there is no eſcaping everlaſting wrath and vengeance. There is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of coming to enjoy him, unleſs we be acquainted with him. <hi>Nec cum potes aut amare quem neſcias, aut habere quem non amaveris:</hi> thou canſt not love him whom thou knoweſt not, nor have him whom thou loveſt not.</p>
                  <p>Nay, let me go a little further, that Knowledge of the Lord, and only that, is life Eternal, which bringeth forth obedience to him. You may ſee this evident in both the parts of godlineſs, both in eſchewing evil, and in doing good. As for the firſt, hear what the Lord himſelf ſaith, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>The fear of the Lord,</hi> that is <hi>Wiſdom, and to depart from evil</hi> is <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> To know him ſo to fear him, to fear to diſobey him and to ſin againſt him: this only is the right Knowledge. As for the other part of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:46169:77"/>
godlineſs, which conſiſts in doing good, ſee that of the Prophet <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 111.10. <hi>A good underſtanding have they that do his Commandments.</hi> They only underſtand and know the Lord effectually and ſavingly, that obey the will of God. Others may have underſtanding, but it is no good underſtanding. That alone is good and right, which makes a man to do his Commandments: and this the Lord himſelf obſerves of the knowledge of <hi>Ioſiah, Ier.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He judged the cauſe of the poor and needy, was not this to know me ſaith the Lord?</hi> q.d. This was knowledge to the purpoſe, this was true and real knowledge of the Lord, which made him ſtrict and carefull in the practice of his duty. And therefore becauſe this is life Eternal, God hath bound himſelf by Covenant to give them whom he means to ſave, ſuch a knowledge of himſelf. His Covenant is <hi>to give them Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> ſee the abridgement of it, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34. <hi>They ſhall all know me,</hi> ſaith God there. But how ſhall they know God? Why, they ſhall know him ſo as to ſerve him and obey him. And therefore it is ſaid before, <hi>I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> They ſhall not have it only in their minds to know it, but in their hearts to practice and obey it, And ſo <hi>they ſhall all know me.</hi> So that you ſee the Knowledge which is ſaving, in which Eternal life conſiſts, hath God for the object of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but though it have him for the Object of it, it hath him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> not for the ſole and only Object: if our knowledge go no further it will never reach home; it will never bring us up to Life and Glory. The Knowledge which is life Eternal (you have heard) in which Eternal life conſiſts, is the knowledge both of God and Chriſt too. Not of the former only, but of the latter alſo. To know God without Chriſt, is not to know him ſavingly, as I ſhall ſhew you more at large hereafter. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> preſſes thoſe whoſe ſalvation he deſires, <hi>that they would grow in the knowledge of the Saviour Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſireth God in behalf of the <hi>Epheſians, that he would give them the ſpirit of wiſdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him,</hi> that is, <hi>of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Indeed, this is the great thing that we muſt deſire to know, if we mean to live for ever. And therefore Chriſt is made ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the only Object of a Chriſtians knowledge, as if there were no other knowledge neceſſary to that great End. <hi>When Chriſt aſcended up on high, he gave gifts unto men,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. and what was the intent and aim of thoſe gifts? Why, to bring men to the knowledge of the Son of God. God is not mentioned there, but the Son of God only. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Corinthians</hi> nothing elſe but Chriſt, and yet his aym was that they might be ſaved. <hi>I determined to know nothing among you,</hi> ſaith he, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. that is, I reſolved ſo to manage and carry the courſe of my Miniſtry, as if I knew nothing <hi>but Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> And in the ſame reſpect it is, that he prefers the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt before all other things, yea before all other knowledge, as being of the greateſt uſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. He doth not only ſay that it is good, but that <hi>it is Excellent,</hi> beyond compare there is an excellency in it. <hi>Yea doubtleſs; I eſteem all things but loſs for the excellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt Ieſus my Lord:</hi> yea life it ſelf <hi>but loſs,</hi> (for that you ſee is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) in regard of that Knowledge which bringeth us to life Eternal.

And hence it was, that though he ſpake with Tongues more then they all, though he abounded and excelled in all ſorts of Learning, yet he gloried in nothing but in the <hi>knowledge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 6.4. as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that eſpecially to be conſiderable in the main buſineſs, to make him everlaſtingly and truly happy.</p>
                  <p>But why is not the <hi>knowledge of the only true God</hi> ſufficient of it ſelf to life Eternal, unleſs we alſo <hi>know Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent?</hi> Let us ſee the reaſons of it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> If we know God and not Chriſt, we know him but as a Creator, and a common Saviour, a Preſerver, not as a Sanctifier or Redeemer. We know him but in ſuch a way, (and very ſhort of ſuch a meaſure) as <hi>Adam</hi> did in the ſtate of Innocency. And which way ſhould we come to life Eternal by ſuch a knowledge as this is? If we look that God ſhould ſave us upon this account, that he hath made us, we are upon a wrong ground. Indeed, did we continue in the ſtate in which he made us, he would be ſure to ſave us too. Could we ſerve him and obey him ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and exactly as <hi>Adam</hi> could and did, while he remained in his firſt Integrity, I muſt acknowledge then it were enough to life Eternal to know him too in ſuch a way as <hi>Adam</hi> did in that ſtate; there were no other knowledge of him neceſſary to make us everlaſtingly and truly happy. But we are loſt you know in the Creation, there we are dead and gone, and theretore it is neceſſary now to know the Lord under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion, if we mean to live for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> as a Repairer of the ruins of decayed and loſt man-kind; as a healer of the Natures, and a Forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the ſins of his people. And thus we cannot know him out of Chriſt, and ſo by Conſequence, unleſs we know Chriſt too. The old and the firſt frame and Fabrick of ſalvation was over-thrown and over-turned by the fall. And if we mean to build it up again, we muſt begin upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, a new Foundation; God was the only Object of Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental knowledge then. Chriſt is at the leaſt the next and the mediate Object of fundamental knowledge now. You know my Brethren, that confeſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> is made by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the Rock on which the Church is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And <hi>other Foundation no man can lay,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> Eph. 1.3, 11. that is, no other ſound and ſolid Foundation then that which is ſaid, <hi>which is Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Its true, the ſame Apoſtle elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſpeaks of the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. That is the Foundation which the Prophets and Apoſtles laid, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them the matter of it, but the layers of it; for ſo you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his meaning in that Text, <hi>You are built on the Foundation of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles,</hi> that is, on the fundamental Doctrine which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles teach, of which foundation <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be not all, yet he is the <hi>chief Corner-ſtone.</hi> The Knowledge of God was the chief point in <hi>Adams</hi> foundation. The knowledge of Chriſt is the chief point in our foundation. Chriſt was not there at all as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, but here he is in the firſt and chief place. There are other Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones that reſt upon him, but he, and he alone is the <hi>chief Corner-ſtone</hi> on which all the reſt are ſet, and who ſupporteth all the building. And
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:46169:78"/>
therefore he that fails of knowing him, muſt needs fail of life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Knowledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unleſs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> we know Chriſt too. Becauſe unleſs we know Chriſt, we know not God as Reconciled unto us. We know him only on the terms that he was with us when we fell, and that is upon terms of enmity and oppoſition. As long as we remain as <hi>Adam</hi> left us, un repaired and un-renewed, vve are enemies to God, God is an enemy to us. And if we knovv him out of Chriſt, either we knovv him not aright, or elſe we knovv him on ſuch terms as theſe are; Chriſt is the only Mediator betvveen God and man. He came dovvn into the World, to take up all the breaches and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences betvveen his Father and his people, and to <hi>make peace by the blood of his Croſs.</hi> And how ſhould Chriſt make peace for us, unleſs we knovv him, unleſs we be acquainted with him? unleſs we put our matter into his hands. So that if vve know Chriſt, vve may know God as a friend, in, and by, and through Chriſt. We may look upon him then as Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us, as pacified and appeaſed tovvards us. But if vve know not Chriſt at all, vve cannot know God otherwiſe then as an Enemy, and as a Judge, and an Avenger: and whether ſuch a knovvledge of him can be life Eternal, judge you?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Knovvledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unleſs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> vve know Chriſt too; becauſe unleſs we know Chriſt, and know him in and through Chriſt, vve know him vvithout Intereſt; vve know him, but as none of ours. We parted vvith the Lord in <hi>Adam,</hi> vve loſt him there, and all the right vve had in him; and which way comes he to be ours again? but by a new, a ſecond Covenant which he makes, the former being broken and diſſolved. <hi>I entered into Covenant with thee, and thou becameſt mine,</hi> ſaith the Lord to his people, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.8. And is not Chriſt the Foundation of the Covenant? Is it not made with him in Chriſt? Is not the condition of the Covenant, Faith in Chriſt? Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Covenant was not made to ſeeds, as many, but to ſeed, as one;</hi> that is, to Chriſt <hi>in aggregato,</hi> comprizing all his members with him. It was not made immediately to us; no, it was made immediately to Chriſt our Head, and in and through him to us his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So that the Lord is not in Covenant with us, he is not ours, vve have no Title to him but in Chriſt. And hence the Intereſt of Chriſt in God is made the riſe and ground of ours, <hi>I aſcend to my God and your God,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. Firſt <hi>mine,</hi> and then <hi>yours.</hi> God is our Maſter but in Chriſt; He is his firſt and chief ſervant, and we are his ſervants in him. God is our Father, but in Chriſt; he is his firſt begotten Son, and we are his ſons in him. So that if we know Chriſt, there is a poſſibility that vve may know the Lord as our God. But if we know not Chriſt at all, how can we know God in him? We may know him as a God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did between the fall and the renewing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, but ſuch a one as we ſhall flie from, and as we can by no means cloſe withall, becauſe we look upon him now as none of ours, as one in whom vve have no Intereſt at all. And certainly Eternal life cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch a Knowledge of the Lord as this is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Knowledge of God is not enough to life Eternal, unleſs we <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:46169:79"/>
know Chriſt too; becauſe unleſs we know Chriſt, as we know God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Intereſt, ſo we know him without Faith; I mean without ſaving faith, if vve know God without Chriſt; we may believe in God vvithout Chriſt: vve may believe in him as he is Omnipotent, and All-mighty, and Eternal, and the like. But ſuch a faith as this will never juſtifie us in the preſent. Life, nor ſave us in the life to come. Even <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> boaſt of faith in God, you know; and yet becauſe they appehend not Jeſus Chriſt, they catch at nothing but a ſhadow; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably loſe their own ſouls. He that denies, and ſo by conſequence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not in the Son, can never have the Father, as you may ſee 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.28. <hi>But he that hath the Son, hath the Father alſo.</hi> Well then, if we will ſo believe in God as to come to <hi>life Eternal,</hi> vve muſt believe in him through Chriſt. Such <hi>truſt have we through Chriſt in God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. And this we cannot do unleſs vve know not God only, <hi>but Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</hi> For diſtinct explicite Knowledge is abſolutely neceſſary to the being of Faith: and perfect Ignorance in any point whatever it be, deſtroyes all faith in that particular. And hence is the Apoſtles queſtion, <hi>How ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> and conſequently <hi>whom they have not known.</hi> So that if we know not Chriſt, we cannot believe in him, vve cannot believe in God with a juſtifying faith. <hi>And he that believes not is condemned already:</hi> ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is in a ſtate of death and condemnation. But if we know both God and Chriſt too, and ſo as to believe in God through Chriſt; <hi>Eternal life</hi> conſiſts in this Knowledge. <hi>This is life Eternal, to know the only true God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Now is it ſo, my Brethren, that the Knowledge which is life Eternal, in which Eternal life conſiſteth, is the Knowledge both of God and Chriſt too?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then in the firſt place, we may here behold the dangerous eſtate of Heathen Nations, who know not Jeſus Chriſt, nor can they any vvay (in the condition they are in) attain to this Knowledge. How ſhould they come to life Eternal, if this be life Eternal, <hi>to know the only true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent?</hi> Its true, that even they have means to know God, as the Apoſtle ſhews and proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. <hi>That which may be known</hi> (conceive it, that which may be naturally known) <hi>of God, is manifeſt in them,</hi> that is the Heathen, for God hath <hi>even ſhewed it to them. For the Inviſible things of him, from the Creation of the world are cleerly ſeen, being underſtood by the things which he hath made, even his eternal power and God-head.</hi> So that there is an Image and Reſemblance of him ſtamped upon the Creatures: there are apparent Characters and foot-ſteps, and Impreſsions of the God-head, of his Power, and of his Wiſdom ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the things that he hath made, which may be looked upon by every eye. How doth his Glory ſhine and gliſter in the Rare and admirable ſtructure of the World, the glorious frame of Heaven and Earth? And hence it is that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament ſheweth his handy-work,</hi> Pſalm 19.1. Indeed, he tells us after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>the Law of the Lord is perfect:</hi> the Word of God, and that alone is a perfect, a compleat and perfect help to bring us to the knowledge of God; but yet there is ſome declaration of him in the Creatures; <hi>the Heavens
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:46169:79"/>
declare the glory of God;</hi> And the means the Heathens have, the creatures Catechize them and inſtruct them in the Knowledge of God, as <hi>Job</hi> ſhews, <hi>Iob</hi> 12.7, <hi>Ask now the beaſts and they ſhall teach thee, the fowls of the heavens and they ſhall tell thee, or ſpeak to the earth and it ſhall teach thee, and the fiſhes of the Sea ſhall declare to thee; who knoweth not in all theſe, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this?</hi> and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, that even they the <hi>heathen know God</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.</p>
                  <p>But now they have no means to know Chriſt, and this is life Eternal to <hi>know both,</hi> both God and Chriſt too. So that in this reſpect they are cut off from life Eternal, which is a very ſad caſe. This Knowledge is not written in the Creature-book, and they have not the Scripture-book, and how then ſhould they come to it? Its true that God is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Creature-book as I ſhewed you even now, but not a word of Chriſt there. Not a word I mean as Man and Mediator of the Church; as he is Chriſt <hi>whom God hath ſent.</hi> He did not make the World as man, and ſo by Conſequence as Man he is not repreſented in the Book of the Creation; God is <hi>written in the heart,</hi> but not a word of Chriſt there. The Law is <hi>written in the heart</hi> by nature, but there are no Impreſſions of the Goſpel, which is the Word of Chriſt, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. And hence it is, that all the Nations that dwell upon the face of the earth have groped after God, and found him too, as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. <hi>All people have acknowledged him.</hi> Let a man run from Eaſt to Weſt, from North to South: let him ranſack all Ages, and where he findeth any men, there he ſhall find ſome Worſhip, or Religion, by which they all acknowledge that there is a God. And though they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the manner of their Worſhip, they all agree in this, that there is a Deity that muſt be Worſhipped. Within theſe hundred years you know my Brethren, there have been many Nations diſcovered, and many are diſcovered ſtill, which were unknown in former Ages. Among them many have been found to live without Law, King, houſe, going naked, and wandering in the open field, yet none without ſome ſpecies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſome notice of a God, which ſhews us evidently, that it is not ſo natural a thing in man to love Society, to cover and to cloath himſelf againſt the injuries of weather (which yet is very natural) as to acknowledge God.</p>
                  <p>But now my Brethren, among which of all theſe Nations who never had the book of Scriptures, ſhall you find any notice of a Chriſt, any inckling of a Saviour or Redeemer? No, no, there is no hint of that among them, they have no glimpſe, no crevice to give them any light of Jeſus Chriſt. And how then can they come to life Eternal, ſince it conſiſteth in the knowledge both of God and Chriſt too? not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer only, but the latter alſo. And therefore we have cauſe to pitty them and bleed over them, and to importune God for them, that the Goſpel may be preached where Chriſt as yet hath not been ſo much as named: <hi>that to the people that are yet in darkneſs there may ſhine a great light.</hi> That as they have ſome intimations of a God, they may know Chriſt too, and ſo may come to live for ever; <hi>for this is life Eternal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo my Brethren, that the knowledge which is life Eternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is the <label type="milestone">

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:46169:80"/>
Knowledge both of God and Chriſt too? Then let the Miniſters, and the Embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt be hence adviſed, as they deſire to ſave themſelves and them that hear them, to bring their Hearers to Eternal life, ſo to inſtruct them and to bring them on-ward in the Knowledge not of God alone but of Jeſus Chriſt too. Let it be their ſpecial labour and endeavour to acquaint them with the things of Jeſus Chriſt, and to implant his Knowledge in their hearts, which is as I have ſhewed ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. <hi>Paul</hi> was a very good Preacher, and ſee what vvas the ſpecial ſubject of his Miniſtry, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26, 27. ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>the riches of the Glory of this Myſterie,</hi> viz. the <hi>Goſpel is Chriſt in you the hope of glory, whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> Out of Chriſt vve can never make them perfect and accompliſhed to ſalvation; the knowledge of the Father will not ſerve the turn, and therefore vve preach Chriſt to them, that in and through him they may be perfect. And though the ſame Apoſtle did ſo excel in knowledge, that he durſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vain glory, compare vvith the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.5, 6. <hi>Though I be rude in ſpeech,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yet not in knowledge, but we have been throughly made manifeſt to you in all things,</hi> q. d. There was no point of knowledge in Religion needful for you to be inſtructed in, no difficult and thorny caſe of Conſcience, that any of you had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to propound to me, but I was able fully and cleerly to reſolve you in; yea though he had received ſuch abundance of Revelation from the Lord, that he was in great danger to be exalted above reaſon, as he himſelf acknowledges, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. yet he profeſſes notwithſtanding that he made no <hi>account</hi> of all his other Learning in compariſon of this, <hi>to know Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> This was the whole ſcope and drift of his Miniſtry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. This was the high point of Learning that he gloried in. This was the Knowledge that he laboured in his preaching to bring the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to. And this he did adviſedly, and upon mature Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>I determined,</hi> ſaith he, it was my ſetled and adviſed reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before I preached to you, that this ſhould be the higheſt point of Knowledge, that I would profeſs my ſelf to be acquainted with, and to have skill in, and which I vvould in the whole courſe of my Miniſtry en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to inſtil into you. <hi>I determined to know nothing among you,</hi> not a title of any thing, <hi>but Ieſus Chriſt and him crucified.</hi> Oh that we vvere all of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> mind! Oh that all Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel would do as this Apoſtle did: that they would not ſo much affect the knowledge of nice &amp; intricate and curious ſpeculations, and buſie their own and other mens heads with unprofitable controverſies with oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Science falſly ſo called, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. That they would not make this their glory to excel others in ſecular Learning, and in ſuch points of knowledge as are vain as to the main and great buſineſs: but rather bend themſelves to ſtudy this point better, and to ſtrive to bring themſelves and others to this skill, <hi>to know Ieſus Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</hi> This were the way indeed to make them happy everlaſtingly, for <hi>this is eternal life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

in which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then be you all intreated, and prevailed withall my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to labour after this Knowledge. Not to content your ſelves vvith this, that you have ſome degrees of the Knowledge of God, unleſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all you know Chriſt too. Let this be your main Endeavour, to get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into thoſe things which concern him, that you may know God in him: That you may look upon him through Chriſt, and ſo may ſee him as he is in Chriſt to his people. <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. <hi>It is Chriſt that we preach.</hi> What then might ſome man ſay, do you not preach God too? Yes, ſaith the Apoſtle there, vve preach God, but we preach him in Chriſt: <hi>for God hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> as it is added in the next words. So then my Brethren, we muſt have the light of the Knowledge of God, but it muſt be in the face of Chriſt. It muſt not ſhine immediately upon us, as it comes from God, for then it vvill overcome us: but it muſt ſhine upon us by Reflection on the face of Chriſt Jeſus. If vve would ſee God we muſt look on Jeſus Chriſt, and we ſhall ſee God in him; and hence our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Philip,</hi> when he entreated him <hi>to ſhew him the Father, he that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo:</hi> If we would know God, vve muſt ſeek to know Chriſt, and vve ſhall know God in him. And therefore let us ſet our ſelves to this buſineſs, to <hi>know God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> yea, to know God in Jeſus Chriſt: and to this I ſhall perſwade vvith ſome Motives.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, till you know God in Jeſus Chriſt, you can have no aſſurance <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of any bleſſing from God, either ſpiritual or temporal; that any thing comes to you in a Covenant-way, for all the Promiſes of God are made in Chriſt. They are the Promiſes of God indeed, as they are called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. but they are made in Jeſus Chriſt, they are in him <hi>Yea,</hi> and in him <hi>Amen,</hi> as it is added there in that place. So that if you know God and not Chriſt, you know him not as making any promiſe to you. You may know him as a threatner, this he doth with reference to Chriſt; but you can never know him as a Promiſer, at leaſt not as a Promiſer to you in ſpecial. You have no Promiſe of the Lord for any thing, no Promiſe of the Lord will reach to you, to profit you, as long as you know not Chriſt the means of Conveyance. Look over all the book of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all the precious Promiſes contained in it, from the beginning of it to the End; and this reſolve, if you know not God, you have no right to in any one of them, nor ſhall you ever (if you ſo continue) be a whit the better from them: God hath made Jeſus Chriſt his <hi>Steward, he hath put all things into his hand,</hi> as vve may ſee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>All things are delivered unto me of my Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour; ſo that they come not to us but through him, they go all through his hands. God hath made <hi>him heir of all things,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. So that you ſee my Brethren, all is his, and Conſequently we can have nothing but from and by, and through him.</p>
                  <p>Till you know God in Jeſus Chriſt, the Bleſſings which you have from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God, you have them not in love and mercy: So that indeed you can find no true and kindly reliſh in them. For this is that vvhich ſweetens all the Bleſſings of the Lord, when a man can ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> of his Children,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:46169:81"/>
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.5 <hi>Theſe are the Children which God hath graciouſly given thy ſervant.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> being reſcued out of danger, <hi>The Lord delivered me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becauſe he delighted in me,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.20. Then are his Bleſſings and Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances ſweet indeed, vvhen we can reliſh love in them, vvhen vve can look upon them as the fruits of mercy. Alas, vve know God poureth out his Bleſſings abundantly on many men, not in love, but in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; <hi>He gave them their deſire,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt of the Jews that periſhed in the Wilderneſs: <hi>but while the meat was in their mouthes, the wrath of God went out againſt them, and ſlew the fatteſt of them,</hi> Pſalm 78.31. they had the Bleſſing, but they had it with a curſe. The Lord did curſe their bleſsings to them, and ſo he doth to all that know him not in Jeſus Chriſt, who is his firſt Beloved, and in whom he loves others. Chriſt is the only Way of Intercourſe between God and our ſouls. He is the Way from God to us; He is the Channel and the Pipe in which the ſtream of Gods love runs down to us. So that there is not one drop of Love from God to any ſoul, but it is conveyed and carried to it in, and by, and through Chriſt. Out of Chriſt we have no Love, and conſequently nothing in Love.</p>

It is in his name that we muſt deſire the bleſsings that we ſeek for at the hands of God; and <hi>whatſoever we ask the Father in his name, he will give it us, John</hi> 16.23. It is in his name that we muſt return the praiſe for bleſsings that we have received, <hi>giving thanks to God the Father by him, Col.</hi> 3.17. If we draw bleſsings down from God, we muſt do it through Chriſt. If we ſend praiſes up to God, we muſt do it through Chriſt.

He and we muſt keep aſunder: But if we know him in Chriſt, we know him then as one who is our own, and whom we ſhall enjoy for ever.</p>

               <p>Others are creatures, he is God. Others are falſe Gods, he is true. And he is the only true; all the reſt, let them be what they will, are but pretenders: There is no other true God but he only.</p>
               <p>What then? is Jeſus Chriſt excepted here from being God? Is this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:46169:82"/>
to the Father? So it ſeems this ſaith our Saviour, here <hi>is life Eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> This place was the great Fortreſs of the <hi>Arrians</hi> heretofore, it was <hi>ſedes dogmatis,</hi> from whence they peremptorily concluded, that the Father on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the true God, and ſo by conſequence that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent,</hi> is but a meer man, a meer creature. And becauſe this wicked Tenent which overthrows the Divinity of Chriſt, and with it the whole work of mans redemption, hath been revived and ſet afoot in theſe times, (which ſeem to be the common ſink, whereunto all the errours and hereſies of former ages empty out themſelves) there muſt the greater care and pains be taken in reſolution of this great ſcruple.</p>
               <p>The Fathers of the Church who lived in or near the days of <hi>Arrius,</hi> perceiving how that errour ſpred it ſelf (for all the world became an <hi>Arrian,</hi> as one of their own expreſſions is) laboured exceedingly in this buſineſs. And truly, my Beloved, if ſome of them had not been ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſie, the truth had not been ſo exceedingly entangled as it is. But now it is become much like a piece of ſilk, that hath been in many hands to be unravelled, and every one almoſt hath left it in a worſe condition then he found it. I ſhall not trouble you with their perplexities, but come as briefly as I can to that which I conceive to be the intention of the words.</p>
               <p>Some have eſſaied to clear the doubt in ſuch a way as this; ſay they, Theſe words are ſo to be applyed to God the Father, as to involve and comprehend the Son with him. <hi>Thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So that the Son is not excluded here from being God, but included with the Father. And <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> alledgeth ſuch another manner of expreſſion, 1 <hi>Cor. 9 only I,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>and Barnabas;</hi> where <hi>Barnabas</hi> is not excluded, but comprehended in the word <hi>only;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, I and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and no other. So in this ſpeech of Chriſt to God the Father, <hi>thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> q.d. <hi>This is life Eternal to know the only true God,</hi> thee, and I, and no other. Or to make it yet more plain, as if the words had run thus, to know thee, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, to be the only true God.</p>
               <p>This would do very well as to the God-head of the Son againſt the <hi>Arrians.</hi> But then the ſelf-ſame ſcruple will ariſe, as to the God-head of the Holy Ghoſt, which ſome others have denyed, for he is evidently left out. And there will be no help for that exception. For if it be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that Chriſt is comprehended with the Father in the word only, Thee and Chriſt the true God, yea the only true God, the Holy Ghoſt is plainly ſhut out. By this account he is not God at all, if this be the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the words, that God and Chriſt, the Father and the Son be the only true God. We have maintained the God-head of the Son indeed, but we have clearly yielded up the God-head of the Holy Ghoſt; And therefore we muſt needs ſhake hands with this, and look after ſome other Expoſition.</p>
               <p>And that as ſome have apprehended, may be this: That God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not ſaid to be the only true God, in oppoſition to the Son or Holy Ghoſt, but to the Idols of the heathen. They are all falſe gods, he only is
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:46169:82"/>
the true God. So that the meaning of our Saviour is but this, as if he ſhould have ſaid, this is Eternal Life to know thee who art the only true God, and not the Idols of the heathen, who are falſe gods. To turn from all thoſe vanities, and to ſerve the living God.</p>
               <p>And I confeſs, if God eſſentially taken for the whole God-head, as comprehending all the perſons, were ſaid to be the only true God in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the heathen Idols, it would bear a clear conſtruction. Or if God perſonally taken for the Father only, were ſaid to be the true God, in oppoſition to thoſe heathen gods, that would hold extreamly well, and there would be no cauſe of ſcruple. But how ſhall God the Father as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Son and Holy Ghoſt, be the only true God? If he be the true God, this hinders not but that the Son may be the true God, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt may be the true God: Becauſe though they be divers perſons, yet they are but one Eſſence. But if the Father be the only true God, how can the Son, how can the Holy Ghoſt be true God? If either of them be the true God, then he which is another from them as he is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon, though he be not another ſubſtance, is not the only true God. For that which is affirmed of him only, cannot be ſaid of any other.</p>
               <p>And therefore that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> as it ſeems to me, gives the cleareſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Saith he, Our Saviour in the Goſpel, eſpecially in this of <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking as man, and not as God, under the name of Father, intimates and comprehends the whole God-head, and ſo he doth in this place. So then his Father here is not God perſonally taken for the firſt perſon of the God-head only, but God Eſſentially taken for the whole Eſſence of the God-head, as involving all the perſons, and ſo he is apparently the only true God.</p>
               <p>To make this Expoſition evident, I ſhall clear theſe two things, and it will be worth our labour, becauſe it opens many other places of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>Firſt that our Saviour in my text, as well as many other places, ſpeaks as man and not as God. And then that by the name of Father, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the whole God-head, of which himſelf as God is one perſon.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, that our Saviour in my Text, as well as many other places, ſpeaks as man, and not as God, is very plain. For he ſpeaks as ſent of God, <hi>thee the only true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> Now though Chriſt, who is God as well as man, be ſent, yet he is ſent moſt properly as man; for ſo, and only ſo he is inferiour, he is the Servant and the Meſſenger of God. Beſides he ſpeaks in prayer in my Text, and prayer is a part of worſhip. And God doth not worſhip God: So that he ſpeaks as man and not as God.</p>
               <p>Now ſpeaking ſo, my Brethren, by the name of Father, he means not the firſt perſon only, but the whole God-head, <hi>Father glorifie thy Son, as thou haſt given him power over all fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this is Life Eternal to know thee</hi> (him whom he calls Father) <hi>to be the only true God.</hi> Nor let this ſeem ſtrange to you; for Chriſt as man is Gods Son. Not God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Son alone, but the Son of the whole God-head. Indeed as God, he is the Son of the firſt perſon only: but as man he is the Son of all the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:46169:83"/>
perſons. As man he is a creature, and he is not God the Fathers creature only, for the works of the Trinity without are undivided. And therefore Chriſt is made the Son of God in the ſame way that <hi>Adam</hi> is, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.33. <hi>He was the Son of</hi> Joſeph, <hi>who was the Son of</hi> Eli, and ſo on, <hi>who was the Son of</hi> Adam, <hi>who was the Son of God.</hi> Now <hi>Adam</hi> you will grant, was not the ſon of God the Father only, but he was the ſon of God eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially taken, the ſon of the whole God-head; and conſequently ſo was <hi>Seth,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Enoch,</hi> and ſo along, and ſo was <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and ſo was Chriſt. And if Chriſt were the Son of God in that ſenſe, I mean of all the three perſons, then he might fittly call him Father in that ſame Notion.</p>
               <p>Why you will ſay then upon this account, Jeſus Chriſt as he is God, is his own Father, as he is man. No, my Beloved, this is not that which I affirm; I do not ſay that Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond perſon in the God-head, is the Father of his man-hood. But the God-head, whereof Jeſus Chriſt himſelf makes one perſon, is really the Father of the ſame Chriſt, as he is man. And ſo he calls him in the firſt verſe of this Chapter; and him he means in the words that I am handling, <hi>thee the only true God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo there is no difficulty in the ſenſe, <hi>q. d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou God who art my Father as I am man (meaning thereby the whole God-head ſubſiſting in the three perſons) art the only true God. And thus I have explained and cleared the words, as well as I am able. The obſervation lies before you.</p>

                  <p>That our God is the true God, is plentifully taught in Scripture. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will carry us to a God, but ſuch an one as is unknown, who he is we cannot tell. And ſo it did the great Philoſophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> which was an Univerſitie, who therefore had an Altar with this Inſcription, <hi>To the unknown God;</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17.23. But Scripture carries us to this God, who is indeed the true God; he is not ſo in ſhew and in pretence alone, but he is ſo in deed and truth. And this is that which he affirmeth of himſelf, and confirmeth many waies; in that memorable place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Evangeliſt doth ſet the finger of an hand againſt him as it were to point him out, in this reſpect, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>We know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Son of God is come, and he hath given us underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we may know him that is true,</hi> (true in himſelf and in his nature, and true in his diſcovery and revelation of himſelf) <hi>and we are in him that is true, this is the true God. q.d.</hi> Take notice of him, and obſerve him well, this is the true God.</p>
                  <p>And as he is the true God, ſo in the ſecond place he is the only true God. There are other falſe gods, there is no other true God, but him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I am God, ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. and there is no God elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me, a juſt God and a Saviour, there is none beſide me. It is repeated
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:46169:83"/>
twice for the better confirmation: And therefore <hi>Jeremy</hi> in this reſpect ſets him in oppoſition to all other gods; <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.8, 9. <hi>They are altogether bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the ſtock is a vain doctrine. Silver ſpread into plates, and Gold from</hi> Ophir, <hi>blew and purple is their cloathing, they are the work of cunning men, but the Lord is the true God.</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks it there ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, he is, and none but he; they are not, he is. The Holy Ghoſt affirms of Idols univerſally, without exception, that they are nothing in the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. nothing of that Idolaters conceit; they are not <hi>Numina</hi> indeed. And therefore it is added in that place, there is no other God but one. And howſoever they are often called Gods in Scripture, yet this is ſpoken according to the apprehenſions and conceits of ſottiſh men, becauſe they think them to be ſo; and therefore this their God-head is recalled again in other places, and they are ſtiled falſe gods; and as a falſe man is no man, ſo a falſe god is no god. I ſpeak not of a falſe man in his words and in his actions, (for ſuch an one may be a man) but of a falſe man in his nature. Even as a painted man hath not the nature of a man, and ſo by conſequence is no man. So Idols painted, or engraven gods, have nothing of the true and living God in them, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence are no gods as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4 8. <hi>Howbeit when ye knew not God, ye did ſervice unto them who by nature are no gods.</hi> And hence an Idol is ſometimes called a lye in Scripture, as <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.11. his molten image is falſhood or a lye, becauſe it hath not that divinity which it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to, &amp; which it is ſuppoſed to have by thoſe that worſhip and adore it. And becauſe it doth not yield that ſuccour which it ſeems to promiſe. You know what God affirmeth of the Idols of the Jews, that they are no gods, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7. <hi>My people have forſaken me, and ſworn by them that are no gods.</hi> An oath is taken there by a Synecdoche for all the parts of holy worſhip, as it is often in the holy Scripture, ſo that the ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, <hi>q. d.</hi> My people have forſaken me the true God, and worſhipped them that are no gods.</p>
                  <p>So that the point is plain you ſee, our God is the true God, and the only true God. Now the Scripture proves it further yet, by Reaſon, and Uſes, and Arguments in this preſent caſe; it will not be unprofitable if I hint them briefly to you.</p>
                  <p>It appears that our God is the only true God, becauſe he, and he only <label type="milestone">

Why he is the living God, as it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the next words.

Then let this ſerve in the firſt place to quicken us, and ſtir us up to ſtrengthen and confirm our faith in this particular, and to endeavour to believe more fully and diſtinctly that our God is God indeed; and verily the beſt among us have need of confirmation here, for we are very apt to waver, and to have doubtful thoughts about it. And they that are moſt free from theſe, have yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections in their faith, of this as well as other parts of truth. They have not yet attained to ſuch a pitch, but they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, and endeavour to get on to further meaſures and degrees. And therefore let it be our labour and endeavour to encreaſe our faith in this particular, and to grow up by full aſſurance of this fundamental truth, that our God is the true God.</p>
                  <p>And to this I ſhall perſwade and ſtir you up with ſome motives.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The more undoubtedly and firmly we believe that our God is the true God, the more we will look to him, the more we will walk with him, and conſequently we will converſe the leſs among the creatures. For hence it
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:46169:84"/>
is becauſe we have ſome doubts and haeſitations in our faith, of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that we have ſo great an eye upon the creature in our wayes: that we approve our ſelves to men, and ſeek the approbation and applauſe of men, that we are afraid of men, afraid of Creatures, but are not afraid of God. Whence is it my beloved, but becauſe we are not abſolutely ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied at all times, that our God is indeed the true God, but have thoughts ariſing in us, or caſt into us, tending at leaſt towards ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this buſineſs: and have not alwayes arguments at hand to put the matter out of all queſtion, and to ſuppreſs ſuch thoughts as theſe as ſoon as they begin to ſtir in us? <hi>Who art thou, that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye, and of the ſon of man that ſhall be made as graſs: And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteſt the Lord thy maker, that hath ſtretched out the Heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth?</hi> Eſa. 51.12, 13. By which the Prophet intimates that we ſhould never be tranſported ſo with ſinful fears of men and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we are, but that the great Creator is ſet by; either he is not in our thoughts, or which is worſe, he is not in our faith. And when we come to this my Brethren, to have ſome ſcruples in our ſelves, whether there be a God at all, or if there be, whether ours which we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, be the right and true God, it is impoſſible but we ſhould (ſo far as thoſe doubts prevail upon us) go out from him, and apply our ſelves to thoſe things which are obvious to the ſence, which we ſee and know to be.</p>
                  <p>The more undoubtedly and firmly we believe that <hi>our God is the true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God,</hi> the more perfectly and fully we ſhall ſerve him and obey him; the more we ſhall truſt in him, the more we ſhall ſeek to him, the more we ſhall ſtrive to pleaſe him; according to the ſtrengthening or weakening of our faith in this particular, will be the meaſure of our ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him, of our reliance and dependence on him. For even as if a man believe there is no God at all, he will not ſerve him, he will not roll himſelf upon him whom he thinketh not to be. So if he believe it weakly, and with many haeſitations that there is a God, or that the God which he hath choſen is the true God, he will fear him, and he will truſt him very weakly and remiſly. He will be on and off, and up and down, according to the ebbings and the flowings of his faith. But if we have a ſtrong and an unſhaken confidence that our God is God indeed, then we will ſet our ſelves to ſerve him fully and without halting. Then we will truſt him perfectly, we will apply our ſelves to pleaſe him, in all our ways and all our actions.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me then, how ſhall we do to put this matter out of all queſtion, that our God is the true God, and what means ſhall we uſe to ſatisfie our ſelves, and to confirm our faith in this particular, becauſe it is a Point of ſuch concernment, and hath ſuch influence in our lives? I ſhall give you ſome Directions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Endeavour to the utmoſt of your power, to give compleat and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> full aſſent and credit to the Scripture, admit not any doubt in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. One main thing that the Scripture doth, is to give teſtimony to the God whom we worſhip; and if we can but ſay that this witneſs is true, there is an end of this buſineſs. So far as we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:46169:85"/>
we cannot but believe (without any haeſitation) that our God is the true God. If we be ſatisfied of the one, we cannot poſſibly have any ſcruple of the other. And therefore we ſhould ſpend our thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch meditations as will ſettle us in this. We ſhould conſider with our ſelves the ſtrange Conſent of Scripture-writers living in ſo many Ages; the ſtrange accompliſhment of Scripture-Propheſies, the ſtrange effect of Scripture-admonitions, exhortations, threatnings. Though it be carried in a low and eaſie ſtile, how it commands us, and prevaileth more upon us then all the Eloquence of men and Angels could ever do, were it united altogether. Eſpecially we ſhould obſerve (we that are God's I mean, (for to ſuch I now ſpeak) what admirable operation it hath had upon our own hearts; how it hath pierced in, and made a ſeparation between our very joynts and marrow. how it hath even told us all that ever we have done; how it hath caſt us down with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row unconceivable, and then raiſed us up again with joy unſpeakable and glorious; how it hath altered and changed us, and turned us clear about, and made us to renounce our profits, pleaſures and delights, our wills, our reaſons and deſires, yea to deny our ſelves, that we might walk by this Rule. Such things as theſe methinks, ſhould mightily confirm us in the truth of this, that the Scripture is the very Word of God. And then this cannot chuſe but follow out of all diſpute, that our God is the true God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Examine all pretenders to the Godhead, and ſee if any of them have ſo good a Plea, ſo good a Title to the Deity as the God whom we worſhip. This I ſuppoſe is out of queſtion with you, that there is a God; this is apparent by the current and the joynt-conſent of men in all times and in all places. For this is not a thing that hath been taught by this or that ſect, or held by this or that people. But all ſects, how much ſoever they have differed in all other things, have held this; and all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, how wide ſoever each from other in place or manners, have taught this. But now the thing we are upon; is, who this God is; whether ours or any other? And truly my Beloved, if this be once admitted, that there is a God, our God will carry it from any other that hath laid any claim to it. As for the Idols of the Heathen, ſtocks and ſtones, I know you will not think it worthy your conſideration, whether any of them were the true God. And for the gods which the <hi>Barbarians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, the Sun, the Moon, the very beaſts themſelves of every ſort, they are no great pretenders neither; we need no more then ordinary reaſon to convince us that theſe can be no Gods. For to ſay truth, they are below men. The <hi>Romane</hi> gods are more conſiderable then the other, and yet they were but men, as <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and the like: Yea, to ſay truth, they were vile and wicked men, addicted to the groſſeſt vices, and ſuch as led moſt prophane and lewd lives: Yea, they were mortal men, and therefore certainly they were not Gods. And hence their very Worſhippers would ſhew you in one place a Temple, and in another place a Sepulchre erected to the ſame God, which is a moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Contradiction. And truly if a man conſider, who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the Godhead beſides our God, and what poor things they
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:46169:85"/>
were, it will exceedingly eſtabliſh and confirm him in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>You cannot think that if there be a God, as that is granted of all hands, he is concealed from the world till this time. And truly for the other gods that have been worſhipped, if you will but examine them, you will apparently diſcover them to have deluded and deceived the world: ſo that you may exceedingly confirm your faith in this reſpect by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of particulars. This god and that god cannot be the true God, and ſo along in all the reſt: And therefore our God is undoubtedly the true God. And you ſhall find the Lord to have ſuch poor Competitors, that you will certainly cry out at laſt, as being fully ſatisfied, The Lord is God, the Lord is God.</p>
                  <p>Be ſure to ſift this buſineſs to the full, when you ſet your ſelves about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it, and not to leave it undetermined in your own thoughts. Never give over till you be reſolved, and till you be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth. It is the fault of many men (yea I believe of many good men) that when ſome thoughts of Atheiſm are caſt in, and when they have ſome doubts ariſing in their hearts, whether the Lord be God or no, (as this the very beſt may have) they do not altogether ſcatter them before they leave them, but leave the buſineſs as it were <hi>in medio,</hi> in ſuſpence; they paſs to other thoughts, and do not fully ſatisfie themſelves in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, whereas a man ſhould never reſt while there is any cloud upon his faith, any ſcruple in his conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Ah, my Beloved, will you be ſlight in ſuch a matter as this is, of ſuch infinite concernment? whether the God which you have choſen be the right or no? How can you but be ſlight accordingly in all the duties of his ſervice? And therefore do not give it over till you be reſolved. Think with your ſelves, I muſt determine either on or off, either one way or the other. And if you be neceſſitated to reſolve, our God will carry it from all the reſt. They that have taken other gods, have taken them upon truſt, they have received them from the cuſtom of the places in which they have been born and bred. And moſt that worſhip our God, take him but in ſuch a way as this is. But if you ſift the buſineſs well, you will find cauſe to ſtick to him whom you have choſen. The more you prove him and examine him, the better you will like him. And therefore I beſeech you, do not halt in this buſineſs, but come to ſome determination and deciſion: Do as <hi>Elijah</hi> counſels <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Be no longer unreſolved: If <hi>Baal</hi> be God, then follow him; but if the Lord be God, then follow him. Reſt not in opinion here, but ſift it to the full. Bring your ſelves to this disjunction: If any other god be true, why then there is no other way, but I muſt worſhip him, and ſerve him. But if our God be the right, then I muſt ſtick cloſe to him. If you be at this hand, that you will abſolutely ſatisfie your ſelves before you leave, before you give the buſineſs over, (as this you are bound to do) you will not leave it any longer in ſuſpence, nor ſuffer any doubtfull thoughts within you unexamined (for then they will return again on all occaſions) you will find that this will ſtrengthen faith exceedingly in this particular. Our God will certainly be gainer, and have very great advantage by coming on the teſt with any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:46169:86"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly and laſtly, ſet all the Grace, and all the ſtrength you have on work in prayer, that God himſelf would ſatisfie you fully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm your faith in this particular, That he would leave no doubt within you concerning ſuch a principle as this is; which is the very <hi>Baſis</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the foundation that ſupports the Fabrick of it, and beareth up the weight of all the building. A man will never come to God by faith, or by repentance, or obedience, unleſs he firſt believe that God is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. And therefore ſtruggle with the Lord about it; if faith begin to waver, or to fail in any meaſure, ſay, as the Diſciples did, O Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our faith, Lord ſtrengthen us, Lord do not ſuffer us to ſhake in this fundamental truth; for this doth ſhake all with it. A man may get a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, an acquired faith, by arguments, and reaſons, and the like; it may be brought into a man by cuſtom; but that will never ſatisfie a man compleatly, conſtantly, unleſs he have infuſed faith, and that is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate gift of God himſelf. If he will ſhew himſelf to any man, then he ſhall ſee, and know, and be aſſured, that he is the true God. But if he will hide himſelf, he can but only grope after him.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo, that our God is the true God? and are you ſatisfied of this? do you know him to be ſo? then ſerve and glorifie him as the true God. Let him have that worſhip, and that honour, and obedience which the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of a God calls for. If he be not the true God, then take your liberty, and walk according to your own luſts, and according to your own pleaſures; abridge your ſelves of nothing to which the byaſs of your nature carries you, take no pains in holy duties, hear no more, pray no more. But if he be indeed the true God, and you dare not to deny it, then live and walk as if you did believe him to be ſo. Stifle not theſe principles which you cannot contradict nor lay aſide. Take heed of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Gentiles did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they liked not to retain God in their knowledge; they had him there, but they liked not to retain him, becauſe he was a trouble to them; fain they would put him out again: The apprehenſion of a God called upon them for ſome duty, and was a curb and a reſtraint from ſome evils. And therefore they were wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſuch thoughts as theſe, and ſought to chaſe them from their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: To ſay truth, they did not like them, and therefore would be rid of them: They knew God, (that they were not able to avoid) but yet they glorified him not as God. And truly this is juſt the caſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians: They do not ſerve, they do not glorifie and worſhip God according to their knowledge of him. They walk not anſwerably to their principles, and to their light in this particular. They yield him to be God, and yet they do not truſt in him, they do not live to him, they do not love, they do not fear him, and the like. They live without God in the world, and they do juſt as they would do, if there were no God at all.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, do but conſider the extream danger of ſuch a courſe as this is. It is the ready way to be delivered up to ſtrong deluſions, and to vile affections, as you may ſee thoſe Gentiles were in the very ſame caſe. Becauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, therefore God gave them up to ſtrong deluſions in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:46169:86"/>
parts, that they were vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh hearts were darkened; to vile affections in their ſenſual part, that they committed all uncleanneſs, and burned in their filthy luſts; their hearts were like an Oven heated by the Baker, they were ſet on fire of hell.</p>
                  <p>And hath it not been thus with many men in our daies? they know God in a ſpeculative and diſcourſive way at leaſt; they were convinced that he was the true God, but they lived not according to their principles in this reſpect, they abated of their ſtrictneſs and devotion, neglected duties which they had been wont exactly to perform, forſook the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and the Worſhip of the Lord, deſpiſed the Word of God, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, took carnal liberty againſt their knowledge, and againſt their conſcience. And now how vain are they become in their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? how fooliſh in their fancies, and opinions, and conceits? How hath God ſent on many of them ſtrong deluſions to believe lyes, that they might all be damned that believe not the truth, but had pleaſure in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs! They knew the truth, but they had pleaſure in unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. They took delight in ſome unrighteous way or other, ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret way of wickedneſs or other, and now they are delivered and believe lyes. It is a lie and a deluſion, but it is a ſtrong deluſion, ſo that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtir them from it. Do what you can, and bring what arguments you will, it is in vain, the deceit is ſtrong upon them.</p>
                  <p>And ſome are alſo given up to vile affections, and to thoſe burning luſts, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in the cited places. This is the formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable judgement of the Lord on thoſe who know God, and do not walk according to their knowledge. And therefore as we own the true God, let us ſerve, and let us worſhip him as ſuch a one, let us live and act for him, let us be taken up with him, let us make this our work to pleaſe him, let us in every thing ſo carry and demean our ſelves, as they ſhould do who have the Lord for their God.</p>

And that which is annexed is very much to be obſerved, <hi>If thou haſt any God
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:46169:87"/>
beſides me, it will be before me.</hi> If we could go behind his back and take another god, there were the leſs iniquity, and there were the more ſafety; it were not ſuch a hainous thing, it were not ſuch a dangerous thing. But to go and take another god before his face, (as if a wife ſhould go and take another Lover and commit uncleanneſs with him, even before her husbands face) what an horrid impudence? what an unſufferable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation? <hi>What,</hi> ſaith the Lord, (as once <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) will he commit adultery before my face?</hi> for ſo idolatry is ſpiritual adultery; will he do it in my preſence, and while I am looking on?

And therefore let us be extreamly cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that we have no other God but him alone who is the only true God.</p>
               <p>But you will ask me now perhaps, what I intend when I exhort you to have no other God but him only? Truly, my Brethren, it involveth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, but I ſhall draw them to a few heads. When I perſwade you to have the Lord and none but him for your God, my meaning is, that you ſhould ſerve him and none but him, that you ſhould fear him and none but him, that you ſhould truſt in him and none but him.</p>
               <p>Then ſince he is the only true God, ſerve him and none but him. Serve the Lord ſo as to ſerve no other with him. So is his own expreſs injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve, Matth.</hi> 4.10. And here to be a little more diſtinct, ſerve the Lord and not Idols, ſerve the Lord and not Times, ſerve the Lord and not Luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, ſerve the Lord and not Idols, they are all falſe gods, he is the only true God, and therefore ſee you ſerve him, and not them. It is a ſin the Scripture very much diſſwades from, and makes the worſt of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and moſt abominable to the Lord. And therefore this is often called the ſin in Scripture by way of eminence above the reſt, becauſe it is a ſin of the moſt infamous and odious rank. And <hi>Jeroboams</hi> drawing <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the worſhip of the calves, is frequently ſet forth by this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>he made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin.</hi> He made them to commit the ſinning ſin, the ſin which is abundantly and out of meaſure ſinfull. And God himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading from it, ſpeaketh of it as that on which his very heart did riſe, which he abhorred to name, on which he could not think without extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of deteſtation; <hi>O do not that abominable thing which I hate, Jer.</hi> 44.4. And otherwiſe indeed it cannot be: For it is the chooſing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther god, that is the Holy Ghoſts expreſſion of it, ſaith he, <hi>they choſe new gods, Judges</hi> 5.8. by which they made it to appear, that they were weary of the old, as if they had diſcovered ſome iniquity in God, as he expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulateth with the Jews upon the like occaſion, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. as if the Lord were found upon experience to be ſuch a god, or were not worth the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer.</p>
               <p>This is a thing from which the very heathen are abhorrent and averſe; the Nations will not change their gods, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.11. though they be but falſe gods, and conſequently no gods, as it is added there in that place. Oh what an odious thing is this, that the Church ſhould change hers, who
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:46169:87"/>
hath the true and everlaſting Lord of heaven and earth for her God. They will not change their falſe gods for the true, and ſhall we change the true God for a falſe? Oh what an horrible indignity is this, what an unſufferable provocation?</p>
               <p>And therefore God is exceedingly incenſed at this iniquity; it is a ſin that kindles anger, great anger, yea the heat of great anger, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.44. <hi>What means the heat of this great anger?</hi> And in the following, verſes it is ſhewed to be becauſe they went and ſerved other gods. Indeed Idolatry ſtirs up the jealouſie of God, and therefore this is added as the reaſon of the prohibition of it, becauſe he is a jealous God. And even as jealouſie in man is (as the wiſe man notes) the rage of man; ſo jealouſie in God (my Brethren) is the rage of God. To ſee his Wife the Church for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and run a whoring after Idols, is ſuch a thing as blows and kindles up the flames of his hotteſt indignation. In what a fearfull rage was God on this occaſion? behold and tremble at it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.9. when <hi>Moſes</hi> hung about him, and beſought him for the people, he flung him off; <hi>Let me alone,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that ſo my anger may wax hot againſt them, and that I may conſume them in a moment.</hi> And if you ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, you ſhall find that God hath executed and inflicted the heavieſt of his plagues and judgements on thoſe that have been guilty of this ſin. Look on the monuments of his ſevereſt and moſt direfull vengeance, and you ſhall find, that as the wrath of God hath been revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt all unrighteouſneſs of men; ſo eſpecially againſt this hideous ſin. And as a man tranſported with a jealous ſpirit, is apt to take unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull revenge; in which reſpect the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>He will not ſpare in the day of vengeance, Prov.</hi> 6.34. even ſo the Lord when he is ſtirred to jealouſie on this occaſion, is wont to meaſure out to ſuch offendors an exceſs and overplus of wrath and vengeance, as you may ſee a ſad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it in the Jews. And therefore I ſhut up this Exhortation, as <hi>John</hi> doth his Epiſtle. <hi>Little children keep your ſelves from Idols, Amen.</hi> Serve the Lord and not Idols.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay perhaps, what needs this? For who among us is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to this ſin? Or which of us doth ſerve Idols? To this I anſwer, That there is not in man a ſtronger inclination to any ſin then that of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as I could ſhew you very plentifully and very clearly from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And as for actual Idolatry, you muſt know, (my Brethren) that there is a groſs and open, and there is a more ſubtile and ſecret Idolatry. The groſs and open is the worſhipping of heathen images and heathen gods, or elſe of Popiſh Crucifixes, and the like; from this perhaps you may acquit your ſelves. But now beſides, there is an inward and ſecret Idolatry, and this is very rife and common in the world, yea in the boſom of the Church it ſelf. Profeſſed Chriſtians many of them, who have but one God in their mouthes, have yet an hundred in their hearts.</p>
               <p>For you muſt know, my Brethren, that this inward Idol-worſhip is not committed only by conceiving an Idol or a creature under the notion of God, which was the errour of the heathen, who thought that <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> were gods. But alſo by aſcribing that to any creature which is peculiar to the Lord. In doing ſo we deifie the creature, and ſet it up
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:46169:88"/>
in Gods ſtead: and this is very uſual among thoſe that would be taken to be Chriſtians: ſome make Idols of themſelves: either their belly is their God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in his time, <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly,</hi> Phil. 3.19. they take more care to pleaſe their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, and fill their bellies, then to pleaſe God. Or elſe they make their policy and wit their God, while they rely and reſt upon it to bring their enterprizes and deſigns to paſs: and ſo accordingly attribute the effecting of them to their own skill, and to their own ability. Theſe are the men <hi>that ſacrifice to their own net, and burn incenſe to their own dragg,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p>Others make Idols of their fellow Creatures, while they lay out that fear, and love, and confidence upon them, which belongs to God only. In this reſpect, the covetous and worldly wretch is ſtiled an Idolater. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. becauſe he loves his riches more then God, and truſteth in his riches more then God. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as love the world, calls them adulterers and adultereſſes, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.4. becauſe they commit this inward Idolatry (which is ſpiritual adultery) with the things of this life. The like may be affirmed of the ambitious man, who loves his honours more then God; and of the voluptuous man, who loves his pleaſures more then God. So that you ſee my Brethren, there is need of this advice even to profeſſed Chriſtians, to ſerve the Lord and not Idols.</p>

Theſe are the men who faſhion and apply themſelves continually to the preſent garb, and to the preſent ſtate of things. Like weather Cocks they turn with every blaſt, like Ships they ſet their ſails to every wind. Brethren, this is an odious thing to mould our ſelves (eſpecially in points of Conſcience and matters of Religion) to the times. Indeed it is obſerved of the men of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> that they were wiſe to underſtand the times, and to know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.31. And ſo I muſt acknowledge, it is wiſdom ſo to obſerve the times, to know our duty what it is, and to perform it in the proper ſeaſon. But to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them ſo to ſerve them, is a very great evil. We muſt not ſerve the times but ſerve the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Serve the Lord and not Luſts; neither your own Luſts, nor the Luſts of others.</p>
               <p>Firſt ſerve the Lord and not your own Luſts: if he be the only true God, he muſt be ſerved, and not them. And yet how many are there who are ſlaves and vaſſals to their own Corruptions, who are not ſubject and obedient to the will of God, but to that which the Evangeliſt calls
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:46169:88"/>
the will of the fleſh, 1 <hi>John</hi> 13. They are a rule unto themſelves, and walk according to their own counſels. That which they have a will and a deſire to do, to which they are carried and ſwayed by their own inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſenſual affections, they freely follow and purſue; but for the will of God, they neither care to know it, nor obey it.</p>
               <p>I wiſh that ſuch would ſeriouſly conſider what a fearfull thing it is for God to leave men to their own wills. He never doth it but in extremity of wrath and vengeance. When he will take ſevere revenge indeed, then he picks out this judgement: <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me.</hi> What muſt become of <hi>Iſrael</hi> now think you? you may behold it in the following verſe, <hi>So I gave them up to their own luſts, to walk according to their own counſels.</hi> And certainly unleſs the Lord ſhould ſend men quick to hell, a heavier Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot come upon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſerve the Lord, and not the Luſts of other men; that is the baſeſt and unworthieſt ſervice in the world, when men are not only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the regular and juſt commands of their ſuperiours (for ſo they are in duty bound to be) but they are ſubject to their wicked humours. They are not only ſerviceable and obedient to their lawfull wills, but they are Bawds and Pandars to their Luſts: They will do any thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they ſhall be offended and diſpleaſed: They will ſerve them in their ſins, and ſerve them in their baſe and wicked humours (though conſcience grumble and recoyl) they will comply with them in every thing, they will humour, and applaud them, and admire them for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. They are reſolved to pleaſe them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God be pleaſed or no. Let ſuch remember that God will never own them for his ſervants, who prefer the favour and reſpects of men above him: Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. If I yet pleaſe men, if I ſeek to pleaſe them ſo that I regard not though I anger and diſpleaſe the Lord Chriſt; If I yet pleaſe men in ſuch a manner, in ſuch a way as this, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>If God be the only true God, then as you muſt ſerve him and none <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but him, ſo you muſt fear him and none but him. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of hoſts himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 8.13. <hi>and let him be your fear and dread:</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks it there excluſively, let him be your fear and none elſe. To which effect is our Saviours admonition, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: But I will forewarn you, whom you ſhall fear, fear him that after he hath killed, hath power to caſt you into hell, I ſay unto you fear him. And therefore we are often rated in the Scripture for our fear of men and creatures as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>Who art thou that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the Son of man that ſhall be made as graſs?</hi> And truly we are very weak in this reſpect abundance of us. We are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly afraid ſometimes how men will uſe us if we fall into their hands, and if they come to have us in their power, we cannot eate, we cannot ſleep, we are ſo infinitely troubled and perplexed. This violent and raging paſſion eats out all the comfort of our lives; And in the mean time we neglect the Lord, who is to be feared, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:46169:89"/>Why you will ſay then, May we not in any caſe fear creatures? No, my Beloved, not in any caſe make them the ultimate &amp; terminative object of our fears. Fear them we may as inſtruments of Gods anger, and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we fear God in them. But to fear them for themſelves, as if they could do evil to us of themſelves, is even to ſet them up in Gods ſtead. Indeed if they could do us any miſchief without God, and which he could not fence us from, we had great reaſon then to fear them, and not him: But ſeeing of themſelves they cannot ſtrike us, and when they do they are but rods in Gods hand, we ſhould not eye the rod ſo much as the hand that ſtrikes with it. God would not call for all our fear, if any creature could do us any damage without him. But ſeeing he alone is able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſave and to deſtroy, I ſay unto you fear him, and none but him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If God be the only true God, then truſt in him and none but him, look not to other gods, as the expreſſion of the Prophet is, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 3.1. put not your truſt and confidence in them. For that from which delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is expected by us, that is the thing to which we look, and on which our eye is fixed. <hi>I will lift up mine eyes to the hills from whence my help cometh, Pſalm</hi> 121.1. Now this we may not do from any creature. For as it cannot hurt us, on the one ſide, ſo neither can it ſave us on the other; no, this is proper to the only true God. <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and there is no God beſides me, a juſt God and a Saviour:</hi> And therefore addeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>Look unto me and be you ſaved, all the ends of the earth, for I am God and none elſe.</hi> And therefore let not any of our hearts depart from God at any time, and ſtep out to other Saviours: Let us not make fleſh our arm, nor place our confidence in earthly Saviours.</p>
               <p>Its that which we are very apt to do, as it is manifeſt by this, that we are ſo diſquieted and troubled in the want, and ſo ſecure in the enjoyment of theſe things, that our very hearts and ſpirits do even come and go with them. But what are they in Gods ſtead, as once the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.7. that they ſhould ſave us and procure our peace? Oh, my Beloved, be exceeding tender how you give his glory to another, how you attribute this to any means, how you expect deliverance from it.

Its true indeed, my Brethren, there are many perſons in the Godhead, but yet there is but one God. And therefore we, though we be many perſons, ſhould labour to be one, as he is one. The argument is the Apoſtles, who preſſeth us to unity upon the very ſame ground, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3. <hi>endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi> And this is uſed as one inducement among the reſt, to urge it, and enforce it on us, becauſe there is but one God, one only true God, as you may ſee in the ſixth verſe of that Chapter. Indeed if there were many Gods, (I mean many true Gods) there were a manifeſt and juſt occaſion of diviſion. It were but reaſonable that there ſhould be rents and breaches among the worſhippers of theſe Gods;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:46169:89"/>
That every one ſhould vehemently contend for the God whom he fears. But if there be but one onely true God, whom all of us do ſerve and worſhip, we may the better be at unity among our ſelves. Yea we ſhould ſtrive the more to be at one, to keep our ſelves in unity, that we may be the better like God. And this is that which Chriſt deſireth in behalf of his Diſciples, in the 11. verſe of this Chapter, Holy father, keep through thy own name thoſe whom thou haſt given me, that they may be one as we are. By which he intimates expreſly, that it is a thing very much to be deſired, that the worſhippers of God ſhould be like God in unity. Not like in all reſpects, (for ſo it is impoſſible that they ſhould be) but as God is one in Eſſence, ſo they ſhould be one in heart and in affection.</p>
               <p>Oh let us labour for this Oneneſs, that we may be in this like God. Let there be no ſeparations and diviſions, but let the Lords <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be like a City that is at unity within it ſelf. And truly there was never greater need to ſet on this Exhortation, than now when God hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a ſpirit of diviſion to poſſeſs his own people; and when the worſhippers of the only true God are of ſo many minds, and draw ſo many waies, and have ſuch vehement and ſuch hot contentions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes among themſelves, that they are no way to be pacified and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So that the Church had never greater reaſon to complain (as <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca</hi> ſometimes did when ſhe had parlies in her womb, and when the twins were ſtruggling there) If it be ſo with me, why am I thus?</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that our God is the only true God? Then let us ſee our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs <label type="milestone">

Oh what an happineſs is this, that we have not been left to this errour! Now therefore let us ſay as <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 34.2. <hi>My ſoul ſhall make her boaſt in the Lord.</hi> Let us boaſt of our God, and let us glory over other men in this regard, that while they have falſe gods, we have the only true God for our God. So that we are not to be equalled for a God, by any people in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, which is indeed the higheſt priviledge that any creature is capable of. It is no ſin to vaunt and pride our ſelves in this prerogative, to make compariſons with others, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 113.5. <hi>Who is like the Lord our God?</hi> there are other gods abroad, but what god is like ours? who can compare with us in this regard? who can ſhew us ſuch a God as we have?

In plainer terms, my Brethren, he is ſent from heaven; and therefore he is called <hi>the Lord from heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47.

                     </label> and how could he deſcend from heaven? It could not be with relation to his manhood, for ſo when he came down, he had never been in heaven, his body had not been there. A man would think it could not be with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his Godhead, for that is everywhere, it filleth heaven and earth, as the Prophets phraſe is. The infiniteneſs and immenſity of the divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty admits not motion, it cannot ſtir from place to place, becauſe it is in all places: and ſo there is no other place into which it may remove. Well then, the Eſſence of the Godhead is immovable, neither is that the meaning when the Scripture ſaith that Chriſt deſcended, that he was ſent down from heaven. And that of Chriſt in the forecited place is very notable to this purpoſe, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the ſon of man which is in heaven.</hi> He was then come down from heaven, he was then upon the earth, when he ſpake theſe words, and yet he addeth, <hi>he was then in heaven too, even the ſon of man who is in heaven.</hi> He ſpeaks not of his manhood, or his humane nature, that was not come down from heaven, for it had never been there at that time. And therefore he intends it manifeſtly of his Godhead in which he was come down from heaven, and yet he was in heaven too at the very ſame time.</p>
                  <p>But how was he come down, if he were there? that is the great ſcruple.</p>

And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accordingly affirms, that <hi>he deſcended into the lower parts of the earth, Epheſ.</hi> 4.9. That is as <hi>Beza</hi> and ſome others underſtand it, he took up his abode and reſidence upon the earth, which is the loweſt of the elements, the loweſt part of this world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The great enquiry is, What errand and what buſineſs Jeſus Chriſt is ſent into the world about? with reference to which he is ſtiled in my Text, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt whom God hath ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this to ſay it in a word, my Brethren, he was ſent to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and a Reconciler between God and man, to make up all the breaches and all the differences between his Father and his people. So that you ſee he was diſpatched upon a ſweet errand. And here he had a double bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and a double work to do; To make Peace, and to preach Peace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he was ſent to make Peace, to do and ſuffer all that was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to compoſe the buſineſs between God and man: To ſatisfie his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to pacifie his Father, and ſo to make him friends with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therefore God is ſaid by him to reconcile even all things to himſelf, all things reconcilable, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. And he is ſaid in the very ſame verſe to have made peace by the blood of his Croſs. This is the errand that he came upon. In this reſpect he is ſtiled <hi>our peace, the Author and procurer of it.</hi> And he is called, <hi>the Meſſenger, the Angel of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Mal.</hi> 3.1. to ſhew us that the Meſſage that his Father ſent him in, was to bring men into a Covenant and agreement with himſelf. And this he did while he took all the matter of the Controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and them out of the way, paid all the debts of his people, cancelled all the bonds and bills that were againſt them, and nailed them to his Croſs in the view of men and Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. That all the world might know, that all the matters in debate between God and them were ended, and that he had no more againſt them. And when he had done this, he cryed out, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> The buſineſs which my Father ſent me in, and which I came into the world about, is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he was ſent to preach Peace; As to procure and purchaſe it, ſo to reveal and publiſh it to his people. And truly if he had not done the latter, the former would have been to no purpoſe. And hence the Father hath diſpatched him down into the world to do both; as to make Peace as a Prieſt, ſo to preach Peace as a Prophet. To let his people know there is a Peace obtained, or elſe how ſhould it profit them if they ſhould never hear of it? <hi>God hath annointed me to preach,</hi> ſaith Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.17. To preach what? To preach the Goſpel, which is the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:46169:91"/>
doctrine of attonement, to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, as it is added there in that place. Indeed he was appointed and deſigned to be the great Prophet, the great Preacher and Revealer of the will of God to men. And therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That God who in former times ſpake to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in the laſt daies ſpoken to us by the Son.</hi> He was deſigned you ſee to be the Fathers ſpokes-man to the world, to tell them what his mind is, to preach the Goſpel, the word of reconciliation to them. This was a great part of the errand which his Father ſent him in, and therefore he is ſaid to ſpeak by him. And Chriſt himſelf acknowledges in this reſpect, <hi>My doctrine is not mine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but his that ſent me, John</hi> 6.0. And when he had diſpatched this part of his Embaſſie too, he told his Father, <hi>I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do:</hi> And what was that work? you have it in verſe 6. <hi>I have revealed thy name,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>unto the men which thou haſt given me out of the world.</hi> I have made known thy mercy to the Church, how ready and inclinable thou art to pardon them, and to be at peace with them. And now I have done this, the buſineſs thou haſt ſent me in is ended. I have no more to do in this world. And thus you ſee what buſineſs and what errand Chriſt is ſent about.</p>
                  <p>Now for the laſt thing, how he is qualified for the diſpatch of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and the delivery of this errand, you muſt know that he is fully qualified every way. And you will eaſily conceive that God would never ſend his Son into the world, upon a buſineſs which he could not manage, and which he was not able to go through withall. And therefore as he hath ſent forth his Son, ſo he hath qualified him abſolutely for the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he hath ſent him in, both with authority and with ability.</p>
                  <p>He hath qualified him with authority, as his Embaſſadors and Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> muſt have, or elſe they are not capable of medling with the affairs and the negotiations of their maſter. And therefore God hath furniſhed Jeſus Chriſt with powers, with ample and compleat authority for the Embaſſage he hath ſent him in. All power is given to him without any limitation. You ſee he hath a large Commiſſion, and conſequently what he doth, concerning what he hath received in Commiſſion, is as valid and effectuall to all intents and purpoſes, as if God the Father did it. He hath not only ſet his ſeal to Chriſts Commiſſion, but he hath ſealed Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed, Iohn</hi> 6.27. So that he came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world with the ſtamp, and with the ſeal of God upon him, that all men might receive him, as ſent forth from him.</p>
                  <p>As God hath qualified him with authority, ſo he hath qualified him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with ability, for the effecting of the buſineſs, and the delivery of the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand which he ſent him in. He hath made him fully able to go through with it, and to that end hath furniſhed him with a fulneſs of Merit, and a fulneſs of Spirit. A fulneſs of Merit to make Peace, and a fulneſs of Spirit to preach Peace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt as God hath ſent him, ſo he hath furniſhed him with a fulneſs of Merit to make Peace. Made him able to the utmoſt, to ſatisfie his juſtice, and to obtain his pardon for his people. For he is God as well as man, in him dwelleth the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily. God, that his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:46169:92"/>
might be valuable for us. Man, that his merits might be applicable to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as he hath furniſhed him with a fulneſs of Merit to make Peace, ſo of Spirit to preach Peace. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>and by this Spirit he hath anointed me to preach the Goſpel;</hi> as it is added there in that place. As he hath ſent and appointed me to preach, ſo annointed me to preach. And therefore grace is ſaid to be poured into the lips of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2. ſo that he ſpake as never man did, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.46. <hi>That ſome were aſtonied at his doctrine, and all men bore him witneſs, and wondered,</hi> Luke 4.22.</p>

The mercy of the Father in ſending Jeſus Chriſt, and the mercy of the Son, in that he would be ſent by him. In both of theſe the grace of God is eminent to admiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Let us here obſerve and wonder at the mercy of the Sender. There was rich grace in this, that God the Father ſent his Son into the world for our ſakes. He is his Son, his only begotten Son, a Son that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly like him, the very picture of his Father, the expreſs image of his perſon, a Son that never did diſpleaſe him, a Son that he dearly loves, in whom his very ſoul delights, in which reſpect he layes him in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, next his heart, as a choice and precious thing. And yet this Son of his he is content to part withall in ſome reſpect, that he and we might come together. To ſend him out of his boſom, and to diſpatch him down into this lower world, there to continue for a while, that when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, he might bring us up with him. Had God any need of us, that he ſhould ſend his Son for us? Ah, my Beloved, he is ſelf-ſufficient, there is enough in him to make him happy everlaſtingly without us: But we muſt be for ever miſerable without him. And therefore it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but free mercy that made him ſend down his beloved Son to us. <hi>Herein is love,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.10. <hi>not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son.</hi> Here is love, and here is mercy to be ſpoken of, and to be wondered at in all ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Let us here take notice of the mercy of the Son, in that he would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf ſo far, as to become the Fathers Meſſenger in this buſineſs. Though he be man, he is the Fathers fellow notwithſtanding, ſo he ſtiles him, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Awake O ſword againſt the man that is my fellow, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.</hi> Though he be found in faſhion as a man, he thinks it no robbery to be equall with God, every way as good as God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.6. And was it not an admirable condeſcention, that when the Father had a Meſſage to diſpatch into the world, for the recovery of loſt creatures,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46169:92"/>
Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſay to him (as once the Prophet in another caſe) Here I am, ſend me. I am very well content to be ſent of this errand. Eſpecially if we conſider, where and whither he was ſent, from heaven to earth, yea to the loweſt parts of the earth, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9. In a ſenſe to hell it ſelf. From the boſom of the Father, if not into the place, into the ſtate and the condition of the damned. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, he ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my ſoul in hell, Pſal.</hi> 16.10. He was ſent to make peace, to reconcile us to his Father, as you heard before, in Explication of the point, and this he was to do by the blood of his Croſs, as the Apoſtle ſhews us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. By his extream and bitter Paſſion, by ſuffering death it ſelf, yea ſuch a ſhamefull and accurſed death upon the Croſs, accompanied with ſuch ingredients, as made him roar, and ſweat, and faint under it. And was it not a miracle of mercy, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould yield himſelf to be ſent on ſuch an errand as this is? That he ſhould willingly ſubmit himſelf to be the Fathers Meſſenger in ſuch a buſineſs? We need not wonder, that he whoſe love and kindneſs was ſo full of wonder, ſhould be called <hi>wonderfull, Iſa.</hi> 9.6.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay perhaps,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                  </label> that this indeed was rare and admirable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if Jeſus Chriſt had willingly expoſed himſelf to this for us. But it ſeems he was conſtrained, it was againſt his will. For he was afraid of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. Yea more then ſo, he prayed againſt it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Father if it be poſsible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let this cup paſs from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, my Beloved,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> that Chriſt muſt be conſidered in a double notion and reſpect, either as a private man, or as a Mediator and a ſurety for his people.</p>
               <p>Take him as a private man who had aſſumed a nature to which death was an enemy, (eſpecially ſo bitter and ſo ſharp a death as he was now about to undergo) and ſo he juſtly feared it, and declined it. Take him as a publick Surety and a mercifull high-Prieſt, and ſo he willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it. And this his willingneſs by reaſon of his Office was the greater, becauſe his will by reaſon of his nature, could not chooſe but ſhrink from it.</p>
               <p>So that here was rich mercy: Had he done it by conſtraint, had he been enforced to it, there had been no ſuch matter in it, (I confeſs) of admiration or thankſgiving. The praiſe had then been due to him that forced him, and not to him that was enforced. But that he ſhould go forth of ſuch an errand willingly for our ſakes, that he ſhould willingly expoſe himſelf to ſuch a death for thoſe who were not friends but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both to his Father and himſelf. This was love, as the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Love in the heighth, and with a witneſs; love to aſtoniſhment and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt is Gods Apoſtle, a Meſſenger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then be <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> you all entreated to receive him, and to give him entertainment when he comes. Do not reject and ſlight a Meſſenger that comes from ſuch a one as God is; you cannot but acknowledge that you owe ſo much to any one whom God ſends, as to give him fair quarter, and to ſhew him all the kindneſs that you can. Indeed the carriage of the world to Jeſus Chriſt in this reſpect is very ſhamefull and unworthy. The Evangeliſt obſerves
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46169:93"/>
it, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.10, 11. that for the greater part he is neglected, ſlighted and deſpiſed on all hands. <hi>He came into the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but they refuſed him, they did not account him worth the looking after.</hi> And why ſo? the cauſe is evident, <hi>they knew him not,</hi> as it is added there in that place. But yet the Jews, a man would think, who were his own, of whom he came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, who knew the propheſies concerning him, ſhould have received and entertained him. No, for the greater number of them, they were as bad, and as averſe as it was poſſible for men to be. He came unto his own, his own friends, his own kindred, his own acquaintance, his own Nation, the people of his own Countrey; but though they were his own, they would not own him, nor embrace him; <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Yea more then ſo, it is obſerved, with reference to them, that God ſent his Son among them, and they caſt him out and ſlew him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.39.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, be not you like thoſe men. Since Jeſus Chriſt is Gods Apoſtle and his Meſſenger, ſince he is ſent from God to you, let him be received by you. When he comes to your doors, let him not ſtand knocking there, till his head be full of dew, and his locks with the drops of the night. No, open preſently and let him in, and entertain him with ſuch honour and reſpect as is agreeable and ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him who comes immediately from God, who is the Meſſenger and Embaſſador of the great God of heaven and earth.</p>
               <p>And that you may the rather be prevailed withall, I ſhall preſent you with a few conſiderations.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Conſider Jeſus Chriſt as he is ſent forth from God, ſo he is ſent on your buſineſs. The errand which he comes about concerns you, and therefore you have cauſe to look after him. If he were ſent into the world about a matter that you had not to do withall, and that concerns you not at all, there were ſome colour that you ſhould neglect him, that you ſhould leave him to be entertained by thoſe whoſe buſineſs he is come about. For what have you to do with him that comes upon a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to another man? But ſure the errand and the buſineſs which our Saviour comes into the world about is yours, it is but reaſon that he ſhould be entertained by you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as the buſineſs which he comes about concerns you, ſo it concerns you for your good, and your advantage. It might be your buſineſs, and yet it might be but a bad buſineſs, ſuch as you have no cauſe to hearken much after, nor to give any welcome entertainment to him that is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about it. It might be for your hurt, and for your ruine, and your condemnation: But Jeſus Chriſt is not ſent into the world (at leaſt he is not ſent immediately and directly) upon any ſuch errand. The Father diſavows it, and ſaith, <hi>he did not ſend his Son into the world, to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved, John</hi> 3.17. And ſo doth the Son too, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.47. <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> So that you ſee Chriſt is the Meſſenger of God for good to you. He is not come to judge you and condemn you, but to ſave you. He comes not with a Writ of death, but with a Pardon, and a Pardon ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own blood, and therefore you have cauſe to bid him welcome.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46169:93"/>
He is ſent to make Peace for you, and to preach Peace to you, as I have ſhewed you formerly. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 61.1. <hi>he hath annointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> You ſee the errand he is ſent upon is all ſweetneſs, the meſſage which he brings is nothing elſe but glad tidings of good things. And therefore let his very feet be beautifull, let his reception and his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment be anſwerable to his buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Conſider that the Father, who hath ſent the Son into the world, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he ſhould be well received and entertained by you. He looks for this at your hands, that you ſhould honour his Embaſſador, and uſe him with reſpect for his ſake. Eſpecially ſince he is not his Embaſſador in ordinary; as he hath many ſuch among you, every Miniſter is ſo. No, my Beloved, Jeſus Chriſt is more then ſo, he is the Extraordinary Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Embaſſador of God, and therefore he will have him entertained with extraordinary honour and reſpect. And this is that which he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſteth in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.37. <hi>Laſt of all he ſent his Son, ſaying, they will reverence my Son.</hi> He had ſent many other Meſſengers before, and they deſpiſed and abuſed them, as you may ſee in that place. But laſt of all he ſent his Son, the greateſt and the beſt Embaſſador he had to ſend, and ſaid, though they have ſlighted other Meſſengers of mine, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will reverence my Son. Though they have abuſed my ſervants, they will not deal ſo with my Son, it is impoſſible they ſhould be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to deſpiſe my Son. So that you ſee, my Brethren, when God ſends his Son to you, he looks he ſhould be well received and entertained by you.</p>
               <p>Conſider, that if you deceive his expectation, he will take deep re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> upon you. If when he hath diſpatched his own Son to you, you will not give him entertainment, but ſhut the doors againſt him, as it were, and turn him off with a refuſall, it will fall heavy on you in the end. It is ſuch a baſe affront, and high indignity to God and Chriſt, as he will never take from you. See the event of ſuch a carriage in the cloſe of the forecited parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.41. <hi>He will miſerably deſtroy thoſe wicked men.</hi> Indeed the wickedneſs of thoſe to whom Chriſt is never ſent, is light and little in compariſon of theirs. He is not ſent to Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they hear not of him any way, God hath not favoured them ſo far as to diſpatch his Son to them, to be a Mediator between him and them. And therefore their iniquity is comparatively ſmall, and their Judgement will be eaſie. But Jeſus Chriſt is ſent to you, he is the Fathers Meſſenger to you, and if you do not entertain him, your ſin is great, and your damnation will be heavy: He will deſtroy others, but he will miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deſtroy you: So that it will be eaſier for <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> for Infidels and Heathens in the day of Judgement, then for you.</p>
               <p>Conſider, if you receive this Meſſenger of God, and entertain him as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> you ought to do, he can do very much with God for you. You are all out with God by nature, he is an enemy to you, and you are enemies to him, your ſouls abhor him, and his ſoul abhors you, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.8. Now Jeſus
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:46169:94"/>
Chriſt is ſent to make peace, to make up all the breaches and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between God and his people. He can make you Gods friends, yea he can make you Gods children. This was the priviledge of thoſe that entertained him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God.</hi> And this ſhall be your priviledge, if you embrace him.</p>
               <p>And is it ſuch a ſmall thing in your eyes to be the children of the higheſt, to be the ſons and daughters of the God of heaven and earth? Is it nothing to have free acceſs to God by prayer and by ſupplication, to cry <hi>Abba Father</hi> to him? That whereas others live without God in the world, and have no refuge in their troubles, we have a Father to betake our ſelves unto. Or is it nothing to have ſure protection and defence, in ſuch a time as this is? For can we think a Father, ſuch a Father ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſo mercifull, will ſee his children ſink and periſh while he is able to relieve them? Or is it nothing to have ſuch a great inheritance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, as God provideth for his children, that rich inheritance with Saints in light? All this we ſhall be ſure to have, if we receive this Meſſenger of God.</p>
               <p>But you will ask me what I mean, when I perſwade you to receive him? I will ſhew you in a word, there go three things to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> You muſt ſo receive this Meſſenger of God, to hearken to him. An Embaſſador you know is not received, unleſs the Prince or State to whom his Maſter ſends him, give him audience. A Meſſenger is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, unleſs you hear the meſſage that he brings you. So Jeſus Chriſt whom God hath ſent, is not received unleſs you hear this Prophet, unleſs you hear him in his Miniſters, unleſs you hear him in his Goſpel-revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his mind and will to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> You muſt ſo receive him, to believe in him. This is indeed receiving of Chriſt. And therefore it is ſo explained, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him, to them gave,</hi> &amp;c. As received him! what is that? even to them that believe in his name. So that receiving, is expounded by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; as if the Holy Ghoſt had ſaid, I mean not by receiving Chriſt, any friendly curteous entertainment that they give him, I do not mean receiving him into their houſes, but I intend receiving him into their hearts by faith. And therefore by receiving, you muſt underſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: So do you receive Chriſt. The only acceptable entertainment you can give him, is by faith, by believing in his name. The Meſſenger of God is ill received, unleſs he have the credit with us to be faithfully believed.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> You muſt ſo receive him, as to obey him. To hearken and to yield to him, in that which he delivereth to you in the name of him that ſent him. You muſt not think to entertain this Meſſenger of God, as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derling to you, ſo as to rule him; no, you muſt be ruled by him. When he delivers his Embaſſage to you from his Father, and tells you what his pleaſure is, as ſoon as you hear you muſt obey him. There muſt be no room for diſputation or expoſtulation, but obedience. You muſt anſwer with the Jews, and with a better heart then they, <hi>All that the Lord commandeth we will do.</hi> And if you thus receive this Meſſenger
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:46169:94"/>
of God, it will be a bleſſed time that he ever came to you.</p>
               <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched two of the Arguments, with which our Saviour preſſes and enforceth the great petition that he makes to God the Father to be glorified by him. Whereof the former hath been taken from the end, why he deſireth to have glory from the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> that he might be enabled to bring glory to the Father. <hi>Father glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie thy Son, that thy Son may alſo glorifie thee.</hi> The ſecond hath been drawn <hi>à Congruo,</hi> from Congruity: it was but meet and congruous that he ſhould have glory from the Father, ſeeing he had power from him. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this is life,</hi> &amp;c. The third remaineth to be entred on at this time, and this is drawn from the deſerving cauſe. Chriſt had glorified the Father, and therefore thinks himſelf worthy to have glory from the Father. <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: And now O Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here our Saviour doth theſe two things; he minds the Father what himſelf hath done, and then reminds him what he deſireth him to do. Firſt, He minds the Father what himſelf hath done, and that in two particulars; <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> And then reminds him hereupon, of that which he deſireth him to do; <hi>And now O Father, glorifie me with thine own ſelf.</hi> As he had ſaid before in the entrance of his prayer, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son:</hi> ſo that he reaſons here from the deſert to the reward, as he might do, though we cannot; for all the works of Chriſt were meritorious. This he had done for God, and therefore this he looks that God ſhould do for him again.</p>
               <p>Begin we now with the firſt thing which our Saviour Chriſt had done, of which he minds the Father, as an inducement to glorifie him with himſelf: <hi>I have glorified thee on the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To glorifie, is either really to make, or elſe to manifeſt, and to declare a perſon to be glorious. Chriſt could not make his Father glorious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was no time in which he was not infinitely and compleatly ſo. From everlaſting he was abſolutely glorious in himſelf: ſo that in this reſpect there could not be the leaſt addition to him any way. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he had manifeſted and declared him to be glorious: that he had ſhewed him in his glory to the world. And this is that which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes clearly in the following verſe, ſaith he, <hi>I have made known thy name to the men which thou haſt given me.</hi> And this he tels him he had done on earth. It was done in heaven before, the glory of the Lord was fully and immediately manifeſted there. And now ſaith Chriſt, it is done in earth too: <hi>I have glorified thee on earth.</hi> And hereupon he looks his Father ſhould glorifie him with himſelf in heaven, as it is added in the following words: So that the point to be obſerved is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> Who ever will be glorified with God in heaven, muſt glorifie him firſt on Earth.</head>
                  <p>Our Saviour Chriſt himſelf you ſee can have it on no other terms: And therefore he deſires it only upon this account: ſaith he to God the Father, <hi>I have glorified thee on Earth, and now O Father, glorifie me with thy ſelf in heaven.</hi> According to his firſt deſire in his beginning of his prayer, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son,</hi> q. d. I ſhould not look for any glory from thee, unleſs I had brought glory to thee: I ſhould be far from any expectation that thou ſhouldſt glorifie me with thy ſelf in heaven, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I were aſſured in my ſelf, that I had glorified thee here upon the earth. But ſeeing I have done the former, I pray thee Father, do the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: ſince I have glorified thee, let me be glorified by thee. And as it was with Chriſt the Head, ſo it muſt be in ſome degree with all the Members. No glory to be had in heaven, till they have glorified God on earth. Its true, they merit not the glory they receive from God, by that which they bring to God, as Chriſt did: but yet the one is not to be attained without the other. They that bring God no glory in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, ſhall have no glory from him in the world to come. The Lord indeed will render glory to every man that worketh good, and ſo glorifieth him; as the Apoſtle ſhews, Rom. 2.10. <hi>But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo diſhonour God in their lives and converſations, he will render nothing elſe but ſhame, and ignominy, and confuſion. They ſhall be raiſed to everlaſting contempt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. and be made ſpectacles of ſhame to men and Angels.</p>

As he predeſtinateth ſuch to the inheritance above, who is abundantly, and out of meaſure glorious, ſo he predeſtinates them alſo, <hi>that they ſhould be to the praiſe of his glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews you, Eph. 1.11, 12. <hi>That he may manifeſt the riches of his glory in the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory:</hi> ſo that you ſee, as he prepares them unto glory, as he appoints them to be glorified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo he prepares them, and appoints them to bring glory to himſelf, Rom. 9.23. <hi>To ſhew forth the praiſes of him that hath called them to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and glory:</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. <hi>Thy people ſhall be all righteous,</hi> (ſaith the Lord of his Church) Iſa. 60.21. <hi>The branch of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.</hi> Not only that they may be glorified, but that I may be glorified too.

Lord will be put off in ſuch a faſhion, that he will be diſappointed of his end and of his purpoſe in ſuch a buſineſs as this is? No, no, aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if he predeſtinate men, that they may be to the praiſe of his glory, as well as that they may be glorified by him: to his praiſe, and to his glory they ſhall be. And if they be not ſo at all, it is apparent they are not predeſtinated by him, and conſequently they ſhall have no glory from him.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my Brethren, that whoever will be glorified with God <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> in heaven, muſt glorifie him firſt on earth: This then may ſerve to ſhew the vanity of their conceit and apprehenſion, who look for glory in the world to come, and yet they bring the Lord no glory here. It is the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable folly and deluſion of the greater part of men, there is not one of us almoſt, but thinks that God will glorifie him with himſelf hereafter. He is an extraordinary man that doth not feed himſelf with this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. And yet thoſe very perſons, many of them who are ſtrong in this opinion, take no care to honour God in any of their ways, nor to bring him any glory: why, my beloved, how can you think now to be glorified with him? Jeſus Chriſt, his own Son, the darling of his own boſom, could not have glory with him upon theſe terms. He did not once ſo much as look for it. Had he not glorified his Father here in this world, he would not have expected that he ſhould have glorified him with himſelf in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ye ſee he ſeeks it, and deſires it only upon this account. And what now, do you think to ſpeed better with the Father, then Jeſus Chriſt, his own Son? do you imagine that you ſhall have glory from him, though you bring no glory to him? when Chriſt himſelf did not, could not obtain it upon ſuch terms as theſe are; do you look in this regard to be preferred before Chriſt? to have the better of God himſelf? Ah my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved do not gull your ſouls with this deluſion.</p>
                  <p>I beſeech you think upon it; you, who by your lewd and vitious converſations diſhonour God continually: you who lie in wickedneſs, and wallow in uncleanneſs, whoſe lives are full of nothing but prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who are conſcious to your ſelves that God hath not a whit of glory brought him by you, unleſs ungodlineſs and ſin will do it: To whom a man may truly ſay, as the Apoſtle doth to ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. The name of God is blaſphemed by your means: do you expect that God ſhould glorifie you with himſelf in heaven, when you have done nothing elſe but diſhonoured him on earth? believe it, he will be ſo far from this, that ſeeing he hath not been glorified by you, he will be glorified upon you. He made you for his glory, and glory he will have, either one way or another; he will not loſe a farthing by you. And if he be not glorified by your holy converſation, he will be glorified in your damnation, and eternal ruine. And all the honour that you loſe him here, he will fetch it out again, and have his penny-worths upon you in the world to come. There you muſt lie and burn, and there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance thence till you have paid the utmoſt farthing.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that whoſoever will be glorified, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you then my Brethren,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> that have thoughts aſpiring to the glory of the world to come, and that deſire to be partakers of it there, you ſee the courſe you are to take;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:46169:96"/>
you muſt make this your work and buſineſs, how you may glorifie the Lord here, how you may ſet him up, and ſhew him in his beauty, and his luſtre to the world. And though you can make no addition to him in himſelf, yet let this be your endeavour all your days, to bring in ſome accruments to his honour among men, that they may honour him the more by your means: that ſo when you come to die, you may beſpeak him, as our Saviour doth, when he was ready to be offered up. <hi>We have glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified thee on earth, and now O Father, glorifie us with thy ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now there are two ways eſpecially, in which you may bring glory to the Lord; either in a way of vocal declaration, or in a way of real repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation: And both theſe ways you muſt endeavour to bring glory to him here, if you deſire to have glory from him hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Glorifie him in a way of vocal declaration; let your tongues be the Trumpeters of his glory, while you are ſpeaking upon all occaſions, of things that tend to the advancement of the honour and the praiſe of God. Any thing that you conceive will ſet him up, and raiſe him in the thoughts of thoſe whom you diſcourſe withal, be ſure that you inſiſt upon it, and enlarge it to the utmoſt; let the name, and let the attributes, and let the works of God loſe nothing by your means. Glorifie him, as Chriſt did by manifeſting and by making known his name to men, by telling what he is, and what he doth, by ſetting forth his power, and mercy, and the like, that ſuch as hear may magnifie him, and admire him. Study God-exalting ſpeeches, and expreſſions, and diſcourſes, and enure your tongues to them, that you may have them ready upon all occaſions, when there is any opportunity, for Gods honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Glorifie him alſo in a way of real repreſentation; and here let him be glorified in what you are, and what you do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let God be glorified in what you are; let his glory ſhine upon you by reflexion, according to the Prophets Exhortation, Iſa. 60.1. <hi>Ariſe, and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> Be you the monuments of his praiſe, the emblems of his love, and of his mercy, the ſtanding pillars on which his goodneſs is engraven, to be read and ſeen of men. Do you ſhew forth the praiſes, or as we find it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the margent, the vertues of him that hath called you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. That every one that looks upon you, &amp; obſerves you, may ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the grace, and holineſs of God in you. That they may ſay, if there be ſo much in the ſtream, what is there in the ſpring and in the fountain? If there be ſo much in the beam, what is there in the Sun of righteouſneſs himſelf? If there be ſo much vertue in them that are called, what is there then in him that hath called them? This makes much for Gods praiſe, and ſo indeed in ſhewing forth the vertue, we ſhew forth the praiſe and the glory of him that hath called us. <hi>He hath made me</hi> (ſaith the Church) <hi>a poliſhed ſhaft,</hi> a choice, a ſpecial, and a poliſhed piece of work, <hi>and ſaid unto me, thou art my ſervant, in whom I will be glorified.</hi> When God makes ſuch curious pieces, and hangs them forth in the view of all the world, he is glorified in them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let God be glorified, as in what you are, ſo in the ſecond place, in what you do, yea, in every thing you do. Let this be the utmoſt aim
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:46169:96"/>
of all your actions. Your acts of nature, as eating, or drinking, or the like, let theſe be done with reference to Gods glory; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>to eat and drink to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. Your civil actions, your trading, dealing, and commercing in the world, your buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelling, giving, lending, your care and labour in your calling, let theſe have the ſame end; You ſee the rule is univerſal in the fore-alledged Text, <hi>whatſoever elſe you do.</hi> Your holy and religious duties, let thoſe have this aſpect and aim, that you may glorifie the Lord, and not your ſelves in them. <hi>That when men ſee your good works,</hi> your frequent hearing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, faſting, bounty to the poor Saints, <hi>they may glorifie</hi> not you the doers of them, but <hi>your Father which is in heaven.</hi> And in a word, (my Brethren) no action is exempt from this direction. And hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 4.11. <hi>If any ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the Oracles of God: if any man miniſter, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified, through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>What then, it may be you will interpoſe and ask,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> may a man aim at nothing elſe but Gods glory? may he propound no other end in any thing he undertakes? may he have no reſpect to others, to himſelf? this is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</p>
                  <p>The rule (as you have heard) is univerſal:<label type="milestone">

                     </label> but that you may the better underſtand the meaning of it, &amp; that your conſcience may not be entangled, you muſt know, that other ends may be propounded in our actions, in a way either of ſubordination, or elſe of oppoſition to the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>A man may aim at nothing elſe, no other end, in oppoſition to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: all ſuch muſt of neceſſity be laid aſide. But other ends may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in ſubordination to it; they may be looked upon as far as they may be ſubſervient to this, which ought to be the ultimate, the utmoſt end of all our actions. A man in his endeavours and painful labours in his calling, may aim at the increaſe of his Eſtate: Not that he may be lifted up above his brethren, not that he may conſume it on his Luſts, or make it fuell to maintain his pride, or his intemperance, or the like. Theſe may not be his ends, becauſe they ſtand in oppoſition to the great and utmoſt end; but that God may be honoured, while he is not burthenſom by his remiſsneſs and his negligence, (but rather hath to give to him that needeth.) And while he makes proviſion for his family, and thoſe that have dependance on him: which he that provideth not for, is worſe then an Infidel. Thus we muſt make the very duties of our callings pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the honour of our God, who keeps his ſervants, not as poor men do, for need; but as rich and great men do, for their magnificence, and ſtate, and glory. And as the hatchet ſerves to make the pin, the pin to hold the timber, the timber to receive the tyle, and all refers to this ſupream and utmoſt end, to build the houſe: we may aim at divers ends, but all of them muſt be ſubſervient, and helping onward to this utmoſt end, the glory of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, which he propoſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the very ſame end, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall take notice only of theſe two things: Firſt, what it was that Chriſt did, and then the manner how he did it. Firſt, what it was that Chriſt did, the work which God the Father had committed to him, which he had put into his hands, which he had given him to do. And then the manner how he did it, he did it abſolutely and compleatly. He did not enter on it and deſiſt again, he did not give it over when he had begun; no, he followed and purſued it, till he had brought it to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time I ſhall faſten on the firſt of theſe, what it was that Chriſt did, the work which God the Father put into his hands, which he had given him to do.</p>
               <p>To give, is ſometimes nothing elſe but to ordain, or to appoint, or to impoſe a thing upon another. And therefore they that have the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, are ſaid with us to give Law. That is, by their authority to enact it and impoſe it on thoſe that are ſubjected to their power. And to the ſame effect our Saviour Chriſt himſelf uſes the very ſame expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>John</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new Commandment give I unto you:</hi> becauſe he laid it on them now by his authority, as he was Mediator of the Church, and ſo accordingly the King and Ruler of his people. So in my Text, you ſee, he makes mention of the works which God had given him to do. That is, which he had laid upon him, and appointed him to do. The buſineſs which he had deſigned him, ordained him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned him to diſpatch in this world. This was the work he was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, that which his Father ordered him to do, he did. <hi>I have finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the work,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> So that the point ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted here is this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father, in the work he did in this world.</head>
                  <p>The task which his Father ſet him, the work which his Father gave him, that he did. As he was Man and Mediator, he did not do things of his own head (if I may reverently expreſs it ſo) no his eye was on his Father for direction. He looked to have his Warrant and Authority for what he did. His Father gave him works before he did them. And
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46169:97"/>
this is that which he profeſſes very often, that he came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him, <hi>John</hi> 6.38. not to do his own works, but the works of him that ſent him. Yea, more then ſo, he tells us plainly, that a neceſſity in this reſpect is laid upon him. <hi>I muſt work the works of him that ſent me, Iohn</hi> 9.4. And hence he calls the works he did, and which he was employed about, his Fathers works, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.37. And is content that all the credit which he had or looked to have among the people, ſhould be put to this iſſue, <hi>If I do not my Fathers works,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>believe me not.</hi> So that the works he did, you ſee, were his Fathers, not his own. No doubt they were in this reſpect his own, that he was the immediate agent of them. But in another way they were his Fathers, in that he was the orderer and diſpoſer of them. His they were, as being done by his direction, and by his command. That Text is full and home to this purpoſe, and parallel to this which I am handling, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.36. <hi>The works which the Father gave me, the ſame works I do.</hi> Theſe very works and no other.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee, my Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt was ordered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To open this a little further, the works of Jeſus Chriſt, as he was Man and Mediator, were principally and eſpecially of two ſorts. Either of ſatisfaction, or of application. His works of ſatisfaction, by which he fully and compleatly anſwered the Juſtice of his Father for the ſins of all the world, if you reſpect the Merit and the Value of theſe works of his. His works of application, by which this ſatisfaction came to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and ſo accordingly to be effectuall to ſuch particular and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all men. Now in both theſe works of his, he was ordered by his Father, as I ſhall ſhew you briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he was ordered by his Father in his works of ſatisfaction; Thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which he did to ſatisfie his Juſtice, and to pacifie his anger, and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to reconcile him to his people. Now theſe works of ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be reduced eſpecially to two heads: For they were either works of active, or elſe they were works of paſſive obedience. And I will ſhew you that his Father ordered him in both theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father in his works of active obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He did them by his Fathers rule, and in ſubjection to his Fathers Law. For though, if you look downwards, he gave Law to others, and therefore he is called <hi>the Law-giver;</hi> yet on the other ſide, if you look upwards, he received Law from God the Father. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4. That is, as ſome tranſlations read it, ſubject to the Law. Subject to the Ceremoniall Law, and therefore circumciſed. Subject to the Morall Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converſant in all the works and duties of holineſs to God, and of righteouſneſs to man. And this not only as a Man, but as a Mediator and a Surety in our ſtead. He ſanctified himſelf, and lived holily, and conſequently in obedience to the Law and will of God for our ſakes. What the Law could not do in us, it did in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. It could not make us perfectly obedient, but it made Chriſt ſo. It could not be fulfilled in us, but it was fulfilled in Chriſt, and by Chriſt, in our ſtead, and for our ſakes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:46169:98"/>He lived exactly by his Fathers Rule and Law in every thing; his works were always regulated by his Fathers will, and therefore he is ſaid to do them in his Fathers name, <hi>John</hi> 10.25. that is, by his authority, and according to his pleaſure and command. <hi>It is my meat and drink,</hi> ſaith he, when he was ſo intent upon the buſineſs of ſaving the poor woman of <hi>Samaria, to do the will of him that ſent me, and to finiſh his work;</hi> John 4.34.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father, as in his works of active, ſo in his works of paſſive obedience: He did what he would have him do in both theſe. And therefore when he was about to ſuffer, and when the nature which he had aſſumed was averſe, he came at length to this Concluſion, <hi>not my will, but thine be done:</hi> Mat. 26.39. <hi>Father, if it be poſsible,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let this cup paſs from me; nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Here it is evident, he did his Fathers will, and not his own. And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>He became obedient to the death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. To ſhew that he ſubmitted to it, in obedience to the Father; And therefore when the Article of death was come, which was the complement of his paſſive obedience, he cried out, <hi>It is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>— The work which I have undertaken, and which the Father impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon me, is accompliſhed and diſpatched. Juſt as he tels the Father in my Text, when he was about to ſuffer; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> In this reſpect is that expreſſion of our Saviour, John 16.10. <hi>The Spirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will convince the world of righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, full and perfect righteouſneſs wrought out by me for all my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And why ſo? becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>I go to my Father, and ye ſee me no more.</hi> If I had not performed the work of my obedience abſolutely and compleatly; if I had not done enough to ſatisfie the juſtice of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the ſins of all my Members, and ſo to juſtifie them, and to make them fully righteous, you ſhould be ſure to ſee me again. If I had not done, and ſuffered all that I was appointed and deſigned to do before my going up to God the Father, he would be ſure to ſend me down again among you; But now, becauſe I go and ſtay with him; becauſe I go to my Father, and you ſee me no more; you may be confident that all is well, that I have ended all the buſineſs that my Father hath ordered me to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and diſpatch in this world.</p>
                  <p>So that you ſee, my brethren, Chriſt was ordered by his Father in his works of ſatisfaction: whether they were works of active, or whether they were works of paſſive obedience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt was ordered by his Father, as in his works of ſatisfaction, ſo in works of application: I mean, in thoſe works of his by which that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction came to be applyed, and ſo accordingly to be effectual. Now this he doth, I mean, he makes it applicable and effectuall (for he doth all in this buſineſs) by working faith in the hearts of his people. And faith he works, Firſt, By the outward promulgation of the Word: and Secondly, By the inward operation of the Spirit. In both of which, while he was converſant upon the Earth, he was ordered by his Father.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, In his outward promulgation of the Word, or in his preaching, Jeſus Chriſt was wholly ordered by his Father. He appointed him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46169:98"/>
both to whom he ſhould preach, and what he ſhould preach: Firſt, He appointed him to whom he ſhould preach, and that was not to the Gentiles, but to the people of the Jews only. And hence ſaid Chriſt to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> Mat. 15.24. <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael: As he was ſent by God the Father, ſo he appointed him to whom he ſhould go, and what he ſhould ſay: He was the Fathers Meſſenger, the Fathers ſpokeſman to the world, and therefore he put words into his mouth: In which reſpect it is, that God is ſaid to ſpeak unto us by the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. The Son doth not ſpeak himſelf, he doth not ſpeak his own thoughts, as he is man and Mediator, but God ſpeaks to us by him. So that he ſpeaks his Fathers mind, he publiſhes his Fathers will and pleaſure to the world. In which reſpect our Saviour ſaith, <hi>my doctrine is not mine, but his that ſent me,</hi> John 7.16. See how the Father orders him in this buſineſs: Mat. 12.18. <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flax ſhall he not quench, until he ſend forth judgement into victory.</hi> And ſo accordingly our Saviour tels us, that his Father had appointed him, both that he ſhould preach, and what he ſhould preach. <hi>He hath anointed me to preach,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. to preach, what? <hi>good tydings to the meek, to proclaim liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.</hi> And this order of the Fathers he obeyed, and therefore it is much to be obſerved, that he begun his publike Miniſtry with this; The firſt Sermon he preached in <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> his own Country, was upon this Text, as you may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father, as in that work of application of his ſatisfaction, which is done in the external promulgation of the Word: ſo in that work of application of it, which is done by the internal operation of the Spirit. He did not by his Spirit draw any to himſelf, nor work faith in the hearts of any, that ſo his ſatisfaction might be actually applyed to them, but only thoſe that were appointed to it by his Father. Thoſe whom his Father gave hm by Election, whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him to juſtifie, and ſanctifie, and ſave, thoſe he ſaved, and no others. Our Saviour Chriſt as he was man, was not to chooſe whom he would make partakers of his ſatisfaction, to whom he would apply the merits of his paſſion: no, he muſt take ſuch as his Father was contented to beſtow upon him. That place is notable to this purpoſe, John 6.37, 38. <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and I will raiſe them up, and give them everlaſting life:</hi> all them, and only them. And why ſo? <hi>For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that ſent me.</hi> My own will as I am man, would carry me to juſtifie and ſave a greater number. But in this I muſt be ordered, I muſt remember I am come to do my Fathers will, and not my own, and therefore I muſt be contented with thoſe whom he is pleaſed to allot me. <hi>I am come that they might have life</hi> (ſaith Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>John</hi> 10.10. They, who? why his ſheep, as he explains it both before and after, <hi>I am the do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r of the ſheep, and I am come, that they may have life.</hi> And at verſe 27. <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I give unto them eternal life.</hi> But how comes Chriſt by theſe ſheep? why by his Fathers own gift. And therefore it is added in the very next words, <hi>My Father which gave them me, is greater than all.</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:46169:99"/>
So that it is as if our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid, I am diſpatched into the lower world, to ſave thoſe whom the Father hath beſtowed upon me. All them, and none but them. I muſt be wholly ruled by him in this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>By this time, I ſuppoſe, the point is fully cleared, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father,</hi> &amp;c. And it was fit he ſhould be ſo: the reaſons of congruity are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> As Man, he was the Fathers Creature, and therefore fit he ſhould be ordered by the Father. It is but reaſon that the Creature ſhould be in every thing diſpoſed and regulated by the will of the Creator. That he that gives it being, ſhould give it Law, to guide the motions and the operations of the being. That he that makes it, ſhould govern it, and rule it too. And that it ſhould be wholly at his pleaſure and diſpoſe, from whom it hath its <hi>eſſe,</hi> and its <hi>operari.</hi> And therefore ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt, if you reſpect his humane nature, is a Creature, it ſtands with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he ſhould be wholly regulated and diſpoſed according to the pleaſure of his Father.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> And as he is the Fathers Creature, ſo in the ſecond place, he is the Fathers ſervant. So that he cals him, Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant.</hi> And ſervants are to do their Maſters will, and not their own, they are in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing to be ordered by their Maſter. And therefore it is very notable, that God the Father having called our Saviour ſervant, ſpeaketh of him ſo, as one that would be regulated and diſpoſed by him. <hi>Behold my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, whom I uphold, he ſhall ſhew judgement to the Gentiles, he ſhall not ſtrive nor cry,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A bruiſed reed he ſhall not break,</hi> and ſo on. Thus and thus he ſhall do, and this he ſhall not do, ſaith God the Father: He is my ſervant, and I will order him at my pleaſure; And ſo our Saviour Chriſt himſelf profeſſes upon all occaſions, that he will be obedient to the Father, as a ſervant ought to be, and that he will do nothing any otherwiſe then he would have him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father in the work he did in this world? And firſt of all in the work of ſatisfaction? Here then we may behold, and wonder at the admirable condeſcention of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that being God co-equal with the Father, he ſhould in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed nature ſtoop ſo low, and ſubmit himſelf ſo far for our ſakes. Its true my Brethren, as he was a man, he was wholly to be ordered in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of obedience, by his Fathers will, ſo far as it was manifeſted in the Law, which he hath univerſally impoſed on all mankind. And this if he aſſumed the nature; he was not able to avoid. But this work of ſatisfaction by his bloody death and paſſion was another thing. It was not any way required of him by the Law of nature, nor did it lie upon him, as he was a man; but it was that in which he willingly ſubmitted to be ordered by his Father for our redemption and ſalvation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to give himſelf to death for us: as you may ſee that place for inſtance, Gal. 2.20. <hi>He loved us, and gave himſelf for us.</hi> To offer up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. To humble himſelf, and become obedient (conceive it paſsively obedient) to the death, yea, the death of the Croſs. So that he was not forced in this reſpect, you ſee, to obey his Fathers order. He was not humbled and made obedient, but he humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46169:99"/>
obedient, and that to the death. And this he clearly intimateth in that ſpeech of his <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man takes my life from me, I have power to lay it down</hi> (that is, to lay it down of choiſe and free election, ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſtrained to it) <hi>and I have power to take it up again.</hi> And certainly if he had power to take it up again when he had loſt it, then he had much more power to keep it while he had it. And hence his death is called <hi>a ſacrifice,</hi> becauſe he voluntarily ſubmitted to it. <hi>He gave himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God.</hi> This death of his aroſe not out of the Condition of his Nature, neither was it inflicted on him by an exceſs of ſtrength in thoſe that brought him to it. But he ſubmitted to it in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Father, and in love to his people. Ah, my Beloved, what a miracle of mercy was there in this Condeſcention? That Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſtoop in this to be ordered by his Father. His obedience to the death, the death of the Croſs, was not of neceſſary duty, as his obedience to the Law was, for that his very Nature call'd for, but it was of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. He ſtooped below himſelf in this obedience, <hi>he humbled himſelf and became obedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my Brethren ſhould not we ſtoop, and ſhould not we be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as Chriſt was? The Father ordered him to ſuffer for us, and he readily and willingly obeyed that order. Suppoſe he order us to ſuffer for our Saviour Chriſt again, ſhall we not willingly obey his order too as Chriſt did? Shall Chriſt take up his Croſs for us, and ſhall not we take up our Croſs for him? I do not ſay we ſhould draw croſſes and afflictions on our ſelves, but if they come upon us for our Saviours ſake, we ſhould not take them as impoſed on us, but we ſhould ſet our ſhoulders to them, and cheerfully ſubmit our ſelves to bear them.</p>
                  <p>But oh the tenderneſs of men to ſuffer any thing for Chriſt? If croſſes, and afflictions, and perſecutions come upon them for his ſake, how do they murmur and repine? Ah my Beloved, remember the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who when he was equal to God, <hi>he humbled himſelf and became obedient, &amp;c.</hi> And will you grumble at a little ſhame, a little trouble, a little loſs of outward things for his ſake? Oh my Beloved, learn at length to be ordered as Chriſt was. To ſuffer willingly for him, who ſuffered willingly for you. And to make you willing to it, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent you but with two Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt though you ſhould ſuffer much, remember yet the time of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is not long. The ſeaſon from our Saviours Incarnation even to the final diſſolution of the World, as ſome expound it, is but an hour, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> calls it. And alas what are our lives, but as it were a little minute of that hour? And ſhall we be ſo facile and tender, to ſink under ſo ſhort a ſuffering? I ſay to you of ſuffering as once our Saviour Chriſt of watching. Can you not ſuffer with him one hour? What, is your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience out ſo ſoon, will it not hold for one hour? Are you ſo quickly weary of ſo ſhort a Croſs? Oh be aſhamed of ſuch unworthy Cowardiſe as this is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider, <hi>if you ſuffer with him</hi> (conceive it willingly and in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) <hi>you ſhall alſo reign with him,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. There is no ordinary way to come to reign with Chriſt hereafter, but by ſuffering with him here,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:46169:100"/>
and by ſuffering willingly as he did. For if you do it of neceſſity, and of conſtraint (as the Apoſtle tells us in another caſe) <hi>you have your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> But if you ſuffer willingly as he did, then you ſhall reign as he doth. And though you be not worthy, yet you ſhall be counted worthy of the Kingdom for which you ſuffer, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.5.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father as in his work of Satisfaction, ſo in his work of Application? Did he apply the merit and the vertue of his ſatisfaction to none but thoſe to whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordered him? Let no man then find fault with Chriſt, that no more are ſaved by him; and that no more are made partakers of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and profit of his paſſion. Alas, my Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is not to chooſe to whom he will apply the ſatisfaction which himſelf hath made, no, he muſt follow the direction and order of his Father in this buſineſs. The work which his Father giveth him to do, that he muſt do, and no other. If he bid him ſave a man, and apply his merits to him, he muſt do it. If he bid him paſs him by, he muſt leave him in his ſins, to periſh and be damned for ever. <hi>I am come down from heaven,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>not to do my own will, but the will of him that ſent me. And this is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath given me I ſhould loſe nothing, Joh.</hi> 6.39. I am preciſely ordered to ſee that not a man of them periſh. As for the reſt they may, they muſt be loſt for me, it is not in my power to help them. All that the Father gives him he can keep and ſave, further then this his Commiſſion doth not reach. No doubt the will of Jeſus Chriſt, as he was Man, would have carryed him to ſave thoſe whom his Father had appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. But he muſt ſtoop in this to the will of him that ſent him. There is no queſtion if he had been free in this regard, he would have pitched upon his own Countreymen, his own Allyes, his own Kindred before others. But the Evangeliſt obſerves, he came to his own (among them he began his Miniſtry) but he did no good there, <hi>his own received him not.</hi> And therefore you ſhall find it in his ſtory, that as man he was extreamly troubled at the unbelief and hardneſs of the peoples hearts. He wept over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with many tears. Why, you will ſay, what needed this, he might have wrought upon them, and converted them, and ſaved them. No my Beloved, he could not do it, he had no order for it from his Father. This belonged not to the work which he had given him to do. And yet as Man he pittied and lamented their condition, as we ſhould do in ſuch a caſe, <hi>he being in all things like unto us, ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> And certainly this pity over loſt Creatures was no ſin.</p>
                  <p>Now this me thinks ſhould overcome and melt the hearts of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates themſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, and make them to relent towards him. Alas he pitties you, and mourns over you: his very bowels yern towards you: he delights not in your ruine and deſtruction. No, he hath ſuch a tender heart (though yours be hard) that it is troubleſome and grievous to him. But why then doth he not relieve and help us, you will ſay? Why he hath no order for it. His Father hath appointed him to whom, and whom alone he ſhall apply the merits of his paſſion, and you perhaps
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46169:100"/>
are none of that number. So that it is not any of the buſineſs that he came into the world about to ſave you. The work of your ſalvation is not given him to do, and if it be not given him, he cannot do it; ſo that the fault is not in Jeſus Chriſt, if any of you periſh and be loſt for ever. Neither is there any reaſon why you ſhould be exaſperated and incenſed againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt was ordered by his Father in the work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> And why then ſhould not we be ordered by him too in all the work we do in this world? Shall Jeſus Chriſt be in ſubjection to the Father, more then we? Shall he be ordered by him, more then we? Shall he be at the Fathers pleaſure and command in every thing, and we be free? What an unreaſonable and incongruous thing were this? Nay, my Beloved; ſhould we not in imitation of our bleſſed Saviour ſtoop to God as he did? and do the work which he hath given us to do? and ſo walk as we have Chriſt for an Example? But alas, how do the greater number of us ſwerve from this pattern? Either we do the good, or elſe we do the evill which God hath not given us to do, I ſhall ſpeak a word to either.</p>
                  <p>Firſt ſome do the good which God hath not given them to do; the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> work is good, but it is not their work. It is given other men, but yet it is not given them to do. The work that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> did, was for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it very good. The incenſe which he meant to offer was ſuch as was preſcribed in the Law, the place in which he meant to offer was the Temple, the Altar upon which he meant to offer, was conſecrated to the Lord, the God to whom he went to offer was the true God. But he was not a perſon qualified and fit to offer, he was not called to that ſervice. This good work was not given him to do. And therefore God was very angry with him, and he was ſtricken with a foul diſeaſe. The like we ſee exemplified in <hi>Saul,</hi> the error was not in the Sacrifice he offered, nor in the object of his offering, the perſon unto whom he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, but only in the perſon that did offer; The work was good, but it was not his work, he had no order for the doing of it, and therefore he was utterly ejected from the Kingdom, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.13. There are ſome works that belong to ſome callings as proper and peculiar to them. Some works that are peculiar to the Magiſtrate, or elſe the Magiſtrate hath no diſtinct calling. Some works that are peculiar to the Miniſter, or elſe the Miniſter hath no diſtinct calling, For that is no diſtinct calling that hath not ſome diſtinct work. Some works there are which God hath given to the Magiſtrate, as a Magiſtrate, to do. Some works there are which God hath given to the Miniſter, as a Miniſter, to do, and theſe works, they that are not called to them may not do. Or if they do, when they have ended them, they cannot ſay to God as Chriſt doth, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as ſome do the good which God hath not given them to do,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo ſome others do the evill which God hath given none to do. They do that uſually which God commandeth not at all, neither comes it into his heart. They look not what the Lord hath ordered them to do. Their eyes are not upon him for direction any way, but what they have
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46169:101"/>
themſelves a mind to do, that they are imployed in. They are a rule un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves, and walk according to their own counſels. They follow the way of their own hearts, and the ſight of their own eyes. They are not guided by the will of God, but by the will of man, and the will of the fleſh, as it is called 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. which ſtands in oppoſition to the will of God. God may order what he will, and they will do what they pleaſe. For tell me, my Beloved, when you ſwear, and when you are unclean, and when you run out to all exceſs of riot, when you prophane the Sabbaths, and the Ordinances of the Lord, when you do things that are apparently and groſly evill, which admit of no excuſe. Are theſe the works which God hath given you to do? Can you look him in the face and tell him ſo? When you lie, and when you cozen, and deceive, do you theſe things by his order? No my Beloved, no ſuch matter: This is the will of God, even your ſanctification, <hi>that as he who hath called you is holy, ſo you ſhould be holy in all manner of converſation.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while you wallow in your luſts, while you defile your ſelves with every ſin, you do not follow Gods order, you do not walk by his rule, but are a rule unto your ſelves. I wiſh that ſuch would ſeriouſly conſider but theſe two things.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, It is the fearfulleſt and the extreameſt judgement that God can bring on any man in this life, to give him ſo far over to himſelf, to neglect his order, &amp; the direction he is pleaſed to give him, and to walk according to his own counſel: who when he permits men as he did the <hi>Gentiles, Act.</hi> 10.16. to wallow in their own ways, the ways which of themſelves they chooſe and follow. This is a formidable thing indeed. And therefore he is wont to execute this in the cloſe of all, as the heavieſt of his judgements, as having nothing left but this to ſhew the fierceneſs of his wrath and fury on a perſon, or a people. When he hath proved and tryed men every way, and nothing will prevail with them, this is the laſt, the parting blow, he gives them over to themſelves, and ſo he leaves them, And this is certainly the worſt that the Almighty God can do to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, If you will not be ordered by the Lord in one way, you ſhall be ordered by him in another. If you will not be ordered by the precept, you ſhall be ordered by the threatning. If you will not do his will, his will ſhall certainly be done upon you. If you ſubmit not here to his commanding will, you ſhall be forced to ſubmit to his condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will hereafter. Here you ſay, you will not hear, you will not do, the Lord commands you this and that, but you reſiſt and ſtand it out, and you will not be obedient. But tell me Brethren, are you able to out-ſtand the curſe and vengeance of the Lord, in the laſt and dreadful day, when he ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels? And when the Lord ſhall order you to go to Hell, and ſay, <hi>Depart you curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> will you be able to reſiſt and to diſobey that order? Will you be able to controle him, and hinder him from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſentence of the Law upon you? No, no, you break the bonds and cords of God here, but then the Lord will bind you faſt enough, in everlaſting chains of darkneſs, break and rent them if you can. The
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:46169:101"/>
haughtineſs of men ſhall be brought low, and God alone ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted in that day. And therefore I beſeech you, my Beloved, eye the Lord in all your ways, and ſee what work it is that he giveth you to do. Be ſure he give it you before you do it. And this indeed is to be men after Gods own heart, when you do Gods will. <hi>I have found</hi> David, ſaith the Lord, Pſal. 89.20. <hi>called, Act.</hi> 13.22. <hi>A man after my own heart, who will do all my wills.</hi> And if you thus do, God will own you in the latter day, and liberally reward you too. After you have done the will of God, you ſhall receive the promiſe, that is, the happineſs and mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. In doing of your own will, or the wills of other men, perhaps you may attain ſome tranſitory riches, pleaſures, honors, poor fleeting things, which in the end will periſh with you. But if you do the will of God, this will perpetuate and Eternize you, and make you to endure for evermore, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.17. <hi>The world paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof, but he that doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi>

               <p>AND thus far of the firſt Particular conſidered in the words, what it was that Chriſt did, the work which God had given him to do.</p>
               <p>The Second follows now in order to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi> The manner how he did it; he did it abſolutely and compleatly, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>I have made an end of it.</hi> Now a work is ended then, when it is ſo diſpatched, that there is no remainder of it to be done. When there is nothing left of it imperfect and unfiniſhed. So that there can be nothing added to it any way, to make it more accompliſhed and compleat. And this is that which Jeſus Chriſt affirmeth of himſelf, in relation to the work that was committed to him of his Father, ſaith he, I have gone through with it, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> or I have brought it to a full end.</p>
               <p>But had he ſo compleated it, and ended it indeed, when he put up this ſupplication to his Father? Was there no remainder of it to be done? Why, the great work of all was yet behind, the offering of himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, as an oblation and Sacrifice to God the Father. He had not yet laid down his life for his people. Yet this he was deſigned to do, his Father had appointed him to tread the Wine-preſs of his wrath, and to become an offering for ſin. In which reſpect the holy Ghoſt affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of him, that it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer. There was a <hi>neceſſe</hi> in it, becauſe it was the Fathers pleaſure that it ſhould be ſo, it was the work that he had given him to do, and how then ſaith our Saviour here, before his paſſion, and before his ſuffering, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Interpreters give various anſwers, according to their various
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:46169:102"/>
apprehenſions of our Saviours meaning in the words. Some think he ſpeaks by way of propheſie, and ſo makes mention of that which was indeed to come, as if it had been paſt already, which is a very uſual thing in Scripture; In ſuch a manner ſpake the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> as a Type or Figure of our Saviour, long before him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.16. <hi>They have pierced my hands and feet, my garments they have parted, and caſt lots upon my veſture.</hi> They had not done it then, but it is ſpoken by anticipation. And ſo our Saviour, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do.</hi> I am about it, and I ſhall as certainly go through with it, as if it were already perfect and conſummate.</p>
               <p>Others conceive our Saviours meaning to be only this, <hi>I have finiſhed the work,</hi> viz. in purpoſe and in preparation. In that I have laid the ground-work and foundation of it, I have aſſumed the humane nature, I have preached the Goſpel freely, I have by my Reproofs and Miracles, and many other ways ſufficiently exaſperated and enraged the <hi>Jews</hi> to crucifie me, and ſo to make an end of this buſineſs. And conſequently I have done as much as lies in me to finiſh it, and to bring it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>The plaineſt and moſt genuine Expoſition, (as it ſhews to me) is that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> which <hi>Beza</hi> and ſome others after him have reſted in. And it is to this purpoſe, <hi>I have finiſhed the work,</hi> that is, as if our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid, I have as good as finiſhed it. My death and paſſion is at hand, I am now ready to be offered up, ſo that my work is upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ended. And thus becauſe the Conſummation of it was ſo near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he minds his Father of it, as a thing that was already perfectly accompliſhed, and fulfilled. <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, my Brethren, finiſh it he did, you ſee he pleads it to his Father, and ſo accordingly the Point on which I ſhall inſiſt is this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt did not do his work by halves, but he went through with the buſineſs that was committed to him by his Father.</head>
                  <p>He did not enter on it and deſiſt again, he did not give it over when he had begun, and leave it incompleat and inconſummate. No, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and purſued it, till he had made an end of it, till he had brought it to perfection. It is his own aſſertion of himſelf, who is the faithful and the true witneſs, and that in Prayer to his Father, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do.</hi> So that we need no other teſtimony to induce us to believe it.</p>
                  <p>He tells us in another place, that it was his <hi>meat and drink to do the the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work,</hi> Joh. 4.34. He was about the work of the Converſion of the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and many of the people of the City with her, and he was ſo intent upon it, that he would neither eat nor drink, till he had done it. And as the Father
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46169:102"/>
put his work into his hands, to this end, that he might go through with it, and diſpatch it, as he himſelf acknowledges, <hi>John</hi> 5.36. Where he ſtileth it, <hi>the work which God had given him to finiſh,</hi> ſo he did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And therefore when he came to die, he cryed out, <hi>it is finiſhed, Iohn</hi> 19.30. The work of Gods Commiſſion, and of Mans Redemption and Salvation is accompliſht, ſo that I have no more to do in this world. In which reſpect perhaps is that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him for whom are all things</hi> (that is the Father) <hi>to make the Captain of our Salvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> Perfect as a Mediator, and as a reconciler between God and Man, becauſe when he had ſuffered once, his work was perfect, ſo that there could be nothing added to it to make it more conſummate and compleat. The point is plain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, but it ſeems there was ſomething yet behind,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, if not of the active, at leaſt of the paſſive obedience of Chriſt, which was a part, if not the greateſt part of his work. Or elſe what is the ſence of the Apoſtle in thoſe words of his, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. <hi>I now rejoyce in my ſufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions,</hi> or ſufferings <hi>of Chriſt.</hi> All was not finiſhed then it ſeems, it was not ſo compleatly ended, but there needed ſome addition.</p>
                  <p>For clearing this, my Brethren, you muſt know there is a twofold paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, the one in his proper and natural,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> the other in his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Body. The one in his own fleſh, the other in the fleſh of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The one for the Redemption and the Reconciliation; the other for the Edification and Confirmation of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of ſufferings may be ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the former afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt indured in his own fleſh, of which we have read at the 22. ver. <hi>You hath he reconciled through death in the body of his fleſh.</hi> The latter ſort are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the after afflictions of Chriſt, endured in the fleſh of his members, in the verſe now cited. <hi>I fill up that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, my Beloved, there is nothing behind of that firſt ſort of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, endured in his own fleſh, for the Redemption of the Church. There is nothing wanting to them, there is no ſuch indigency or failing in them, as to need a ſupplement or a ſupply by the after af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of Martyrs or Saints. No, my Beloved, the Paſſion of our Saviour is compleat and full, he finiſhed it himſelf upon the Croſs. It was the laſt word that he ſpake, before he yeelded up his ſoul into the hands of God the Father. And ſince it was his laſt, his dying word, the ſin were the greater, if we ſhould not believe him.</p>
                  <p>But there is much behind of the latter ſort of ſufferings of Chriſt, endured in the fleſh of his members. And theſe are more and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated every day. For even as the Father did determine the number and meaſure of the ſufferings of Chriſt, which he ſhould endure in his natural body, which he accordingly accompliſhed and fulfilled. So he hath alſo determined the number and meaſure of the ſufferings of Chriſt in his myſtical body, which they accordingly, muſt accompliſh and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill. So that every perſecution and affliction that any of his members ſuffer, abates the number and the tale, leſſeneth the heap of thoſe afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46169:103"/>
And hence it was that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> rejoyced, becauſe he fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up that which was behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt in his myſtical body. This comforts me and cheers me yet, that by the trials and the troubles that are now upon me, I make up the remainder of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which God the Father hath appointed Chriſt to undergo, although not in himſelf, yet in his members. I rejoyce in my ſufferings, becauſe I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Chriſt in my fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Now is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt did not do his work by halves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are ſeverely to be cenſured then, who come in with their additions to the works of Chriſt; and go about to botch it up with their ſupplies. As if he had not done what he profeſſes to his Father in my Text, but had left his work imperfect: So that it needed any thing which they can either do or ſuffer, to finiſh it and make it perfect.</p>
                  <p>And here the Papiſts are not only faulty, who make up the work of Chriſt, and fill it out with the invented ſuperfluities of the ſufferings of their Martyrs and the merits of their Saints. As if he had not done enough himſelf to make us perfect, to ſatisfie the juſtice of his Father for us.</p>
                  <p>But even many of the Saints themſelves ſometimes, though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus Chriſt hath finiſhed the work of their Redemption, and that it needs no Supplement in any kind, much leſs that any thing that they can do, can make the leaſt addition to it, yet are inſenſibly betrayed, they know not how, into a kind of joyning of their duties with him, in the work of their Redemption and Salvation. For this they do in ſome degree, while they expect to be accepted with the Lord, and to be juſtified and ſaved, the rather for their works and duties. And therefore when they ſeriouſly conſider with themſelves, how they ſhall have their ſins forgiven them, how they ſhall be admitted into Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, they are not ſatisfied to look upon the work that Chriſt hath done, to make him all in all in this buſineſs, but they muſt alſo caſt an eye on that which they themſelves have done. And when they think upon their own enlargements; their deep humiliations, their earneſt and inceſſant labours in the ſervice of the Lord, they do, they know not how, put then in with Jeſus Chriſt as joynt Saviours. Much hath been ſaid of late againſt duty, ſo much, that it hath been more ſlighted and neglected then it ought to be. That which I ſpeak is not againſt the doing of it, but againſt the mixing of it with the work of Jeſus Chriſt. The ſetting of our poſts by his poſts, and our works by his works. Ah, my Beloved; let us be extreamly ſhie of this, let us not ſo diſhonour Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as if he had not done enough to juſtifie us, and to gain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance for us: But ſince he hath finiſhed the work himſelf, and done it perfectly; Oh let us truſt him perfectly for Redemption and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us relie on what he hath done, and reſolve with the Apoſtle, that we <hi>are compleat in him,</hi> Col. 2.10. ſo that we ſtand in need of no addition. When we are thinking how we ſhall be ſatisfied, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, juſtified in this world, and ſaved in the world to come. Though we have lived like Angels, and done religious duties, as if we were in Heaven already, let us bid all this ſtand by, and cry out
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46169:103"/>
with the holy Martyr in the flames, <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt did not do his works by halves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> let not us, my Brethren, do our works by halves neither, but let us finiſh them as Chriſt did. If we be entred on the work and ſervice of the Lord, as many of us are, O let us not give over and deſiſt again. Let not our righteouſneſs be like the morning cloud, and early dew. If we have taken pains in holy Duties, and have gone onward in them many years, in Hearing, in Prayer, and in Faſting, and the like, let us be diligent and conſtant ſtill, let us hold on our way; as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>The upright man doth;</hi> Let us not give over all again, as ſome have done in theſe times. Let us not be weary of well doing; No, as we have begun to work, and as we have wrought hitherto, ſo let us work ſtill, till we have finiſhed all the work that God hath given us to do; and let our laſt work be more then our firſt. And to this end, I beſeech you carefully to weigh theſe few things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If we finiſh not our work, and if we do not end well, it argues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that we were not right, and ſound in the beginning. <hi>They that are planted in the houſe of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, ſhall flouriſh in the Courts of our God, they ſhall bring forth more fruit in their age,</hi> Pſalm 92.13, 14. And hence it is obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt of the beſt of Gods ſervants, that they never ſhewed ſuch Zeal, and Faithfulneſs, and Diligence in the work of the Lord, as when they drew near their end, and when they ſaw their time was ready to expire. As <hi>Jacob, Moſes, Joſhuah, David, Peter</hi> ſhewed more care of Gods Church, and more zeal for Gods Glory towards their end, then they had ever done before. Yea, Our Saviour Chriſt himſelf was never ſo much in prayer, ſo painfull and affectionate in comforting, and in inſtructing his Diſciples, as he was when he was ready to be offered up. He wrought the works of him that ſent him while it was day, as his own expreſſion is, <hi>While the day of life laſted,</hi> John 9.4. And therefore ſo let us too. His unwearied diligence is very notable. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.37, 38. <hi>In the day time he was teaching in the Temple, and at night he went into the Mount of</hi> Olives, <hi>where he retired himſelf to prayer. And all the people came early to him in the morning, in the Temple, for to hear him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you finiſh not your work, and if you go not through with your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> buſineſs, you diſhonour God. There is no way to glorifie him, but by perſeverance, as our Saviour Chriſt inſinuates in my Text; ſaith he to God the Father, <hi>I have glorified thee upon the earth.</hi> How ſo, might God reply? Why, <hi>I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> I have not entred on it only, and carried it along awhile, but I have brought it to perfection. God is never glorified, but by finiſhing his Works. To begin, and then fall back, is to put God and Chriſt to ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If you finiſh not your work, as you diſhonour God and Chriſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ſo you ſhame your ſelves too. This man began to build, but was not able to make an end. Nothing makes a man ſo baſe and deſpicable in the eyes of God, and gracious men, as to have been religious, zealous, earneſt, hot in the beginning, and to become an Enemy, a Worldling, a lazie, idle Drone in the concluſion. <hi>The ſalt that hath loſt its ſavour,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46169:104"/>
is good for nothing,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>but to be caſt out with contempt, and to be trodden under feet of all men,</hi> Mat. 5.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> You loſe all that you have wrought, and all that you have done already, if you finiſh not your work. All your obedience both active and paſſive is utterly loſt. <hi>Your active obedience is as it were forgotten with God, unleſs you continue,</hi> Ezek. 18.24. So is your paſſive, if you fail in Perſeverance. <hi>Your ſufferings are in vain,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3.4. In a word, It is conſtancy in doing and ſuffering that crowneth a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; It is not promiſed to Beginners, but to ſuch as continue: Beloved, Here are many of you that have done many things, and ſuffered many things for God. Many that have taken pains in holy Duties, in Hearing, Praying, Faſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh let not all be caſt away, let not all that you have done or ſuffered be in vain. I ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> 2.8. <hi>Loſe not the things that you have wrought.</hi> It is a ſad and lamentable thing to ſee a man come home even to Heaven-gate, and for want of one ſtep more, to tumble back again into Hell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If you end your works well, you ſhall have very good wages, you ſhall receive a full Reward. <hi>He that continueth to the end, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mat. 24.13. <hi>If you be faithfull to the death, you ſhall receive the Crown of life,</hi> Apoc. 2.10. And if you thus hold out in Gods work, till the Period of your lives, when you ſhall come to die, you may conclude with God as Chriſt doth, <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do, and now O Father, Glorifie me with thy ſelf.</hi> And you may ſing your dying ſong with the Apoſtle, 2 Tim. 4.7. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which God the righteous Judge ſhall give me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched three of the Arguments, with which our Saviour preſſeth, and enforceth the great Petition that he makes to God the Father. And we are now deſcended to the fourth and laſt, and it is drawn <hi>Ab aequo,</hi> from the Equity of that which he petitions for, and the right he had to it: Nay, He affirmeth, that he had not only <hi>Jus ad rem,</hi> but more then ſo, he had <hi>Jus in re</hi> too. He had not only Right and Title to the Glory which he prayes he may be made Partaker of, but he had the poſſeſſion of it, and that from all Eternity.</p>

               </epigraph>
               <p>SO that our Saviour pleads Preſcription for the Glory he deſires, and for which he is a Suitor in my Text: he had it, as he tells the Father here, time out of mind, indeed before all time, <hi>before the world was.</hi> And therefore though he hath in ſome reſpect been out of the poſſeſſion of it for awhile, he hopes he ſhall recover it again with his Fathers good liking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:46169:104"/>The only difficulty lies in this, what Glory Jeſus Chriſt intends in this place, whether the Glory of his God-head, or the Glory of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of his divine or humane nature. And it will be the harder to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, becauſe againſt either of them there is appearingly a very ſtrong exception. It ſhould ſeem he could not mean the Glory of his God-head, for that he had never loſt. A man would think he would not mean the Glory of his Man-hood, for that he never had, and therefore could not pray for the Recovery, or the Reſtitution of the one, or of the other; he could not ſay to God the Father, with relation to his God-head, <hi>Glorifie me with the Glory which I had with thee before the world was,</hi> becauſe he had that Glory with the Father ſtill; when he made that Prayer, he was co-equal, co-eſſential with him ſtill, and conſequently he was infinitely glorious with him ſtill. He could not ſay with relation to his Man-hood, <hi>Glorifie me with the Glory which I had with thee before the world was,</hi> becauſe the humane nature came to have a being but a little while ago. It was aſſumed by our Saviour many ages ſince the world was, and ſo could have no Glory with the Father before the world was. So that it cannot be intended of the God-head, or the Man-hood, if you take either of them ſeverally and diſtinctly by it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Its true the God-head of our Saviour ſeemed to be deveſted of the Glory which it had from everlaſting, when he aſſumed the mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſervant, and ſo in that reſpect he might deſire the reſtitution of it; but if you mark it well, the God-head never loſt the Glory which it had with God the Father, though it might ſeem to loſe the Glory which it had with men. It was not humbled really, but in regard of declaration only, and that with reference to men, and not to God, who is not carryed by appearances. And that which Chriſt deſires, is, that his Father would glorifie him with himſelf, with the ſame Glory which he had with him before the world was.</p>
               <p>Beſides, Our Saviour prayes as man, and not as God, (for God doth not worſhip God,) and 'tis incongruous that the Man-hood ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Suitor for any thing to be conferred upon the God-head.</p>
               <p>And therefore to avoid the rocks on either ſide, the ſum of this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviour to his Father muſt be this, that as his God-head had been glorious with himſelf from everlaſting, ſo now his Man-hood might be glorious too. That the Glory which he had as God, together with the Father from Eternity, might be communicated to his Man-hood, ſo far as it was capable of it, in ſuch a meaſure as it could receive it. That God would raiſe him up, and ſet him in his humane nature, at his own right hand in heavenly places, and make him glorious, even as he was man, in the eyes of all the world. And this is clearly that which Chriſt intendeth in his Prayer here, <hi>And now O Father, Glorifie me with thine own ſelf, with the Glory which I had with thee before the world was:</hi> Glorifie me with thy ſelf as I am man, or as I am God-man, with the Glory I had with thee as I am God, before the world was. I was glorious with thy ſelf, as I am God from Everlaſting, and now let me be glorious with thee as I am God and Man too. In one nature I was glorious from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>viz.</hi> in my divine Nature, and now let me be glorified in my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:46169:105"/>
and humane Nature too, let me be glorified in my perſon.</p>
               <p>Now this Petition of our Saviour (you muſt conſider) did undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prevail with God the Father; for he was always heard in every thing that he deſired of him; his Father never put him off with a denial. And then the point to be obſerved, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That even the Man-hood of our Saviour participateth of the Glory whereof the God-head hath been ſeized together with the Father from Eternity.</head>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt as he is man, ſhares in ſome meaſure and proportion in the Glory of the God-head. There is a ſocial Glory (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call it) of our Saviours humane Nature, which it partaketh with the God-head, and which it could not have without it. The Glory which the God-head had alone from Everlaſting, is now communicated to the perſon, conſiſting of the two Natures, both of the God-head, and the Man-hood too. <hi>God hath highly exalted him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. Him, Who? why Jeſus Chriſt both God and Man, in his divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. As for the former, his divine Nature, though that be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly incapable of an intrinſical improvement of the Glory of it, yet ſo far forth as it was humbled for the Adminiſtration of his Office, ſo far it was accordingly advanced again. Now he abaſed himſelf as he was God, not by putting off his Glory, but by permitting it to be ecclipſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and overſhadowed with the ſimilitude of ſinfull fleſh, and to be humbled under the form of a ſervant, even as the brightneſs of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is hidden in a dark and cloſe Lanthorn; ſo that declaratorily he is in that reſpect exalted, he is declared to be the Son of God by Power, in riſing from the dead, and returning to his Glory.</p>
                  <p>As for the humane Nature that is properly exalted: For being joyned to the God-head, it hath an ample and immediate claim to all the Glory, which from the God-head might be communicated to it, and conferred upon it. So that however, while our Saviour Chriſt continued here, the Exigence of the condition, and the office which he had aſſumed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, made him a man of ſorrows and of ſufferings, and intercepted as it were the beams of the divine Glory from ſhining in the other nature, ſo that there was no form nor beauty in him. Yet having finiſhed that Diſpenſation, there was by vertue of the intimate Aſſociation of the Man-hood with the God-head, a giving out, or a Communication of all the Glory from the Deity which the other Nature was capable of. And this is that which Jeſus Chriſt deſireth of his Father in my Text: And even as by the Spirit of Holineſs he was filled with Treaſure of Wiſdom, and Knowledge, and Grace, and thereby fitted for the office of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour, and made the Head and Ruler of the Church. So likewiſe by the Spirit of Glory, he is filled with unmatchable perfections, beyond the Comprehenſions of all other Creatures. Being not only full of Glory, but having in him all the fulneſs of Glory, which a created nature, joyned to an infinite and endleſs fountain, could receive. The God-head of our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:46169:105"/>
Saviour was at the right hand of the Father from Eternity. But now the Man-hood of our Saviour is exalted to the ſame condition. I ſay not to the ſame meaſure, but to the ſame condition of Majeſty and Glory with it. <hi>God hath raiſed him from the dead,</hi> (and that you know muſt be as he is man) <hi>and ſet him at his own right hand in heavenly places,</hi> Eph. 1.20. That is, he ſet him up above all other things or perſons, in the next place to himſelf. And therefore it is added in the following words, <hi>Far above all Principality, and Power, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not only in this world, but in that which is to come.</hi> In which reſpect it is that God will have him worſhipped with divine and religious Adoration, <hi>and that by the very Angels,</hi> Heb. 1.6. Of which the humane Nature ſingle is not capable, but that it ſhineth with the God-head in this high Glory.</p>
                  <p>Much might be added for the proof of this, that even the Man-hood of our Saviour participateth of the Glory whereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to open it a little more particularly and diſtinctly to you. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, you muſt know that the Man-hood of our Saviour comes not by nature to partake of this Glory. Look upon the humane Nature as conſidered in it ſelf, and ſo it hath no right to it. It is by Grace then that the Glory of the God-head is communicated to it; and that by a double Grace, the Grace of Union, and the Grace of Diſpenſation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Man-hood of our Saviour participateth of the Glory of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the God-head by the Grace of Union. It comes to be Partaker of it by its unutterably near, and intimate Aſſociation with the God-head in the ſame perſon. For ſo the God head and the Man-hood as you know, are joyned together in ſuch a tie, as cannot fully be expreſſed. Not as a man and a wife are joyned together, who notwithſtanding their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction continue two diſtinct perſons. But as the body and the ſoul make one man, ſo God and man make one Chriſt. And as the glory of the ſoul, by reaſon of the nearneſs of the Union, redoundeth to the glory of the perſon, and conſequently of the body too; even ſo the Glory of the God-head redoundeth to the Glory of the Man-hood in the perſon of our Saviour. So infinitely near is the Conjunction, that both the Natures cannot chuſe but ſhare together. And as the God-head was in ſome reſpect abaſed, in being joyned to the Man-hood, being ecclipſed and ſhadowed with the meanneſs, and the imperfections of it. Even ſo the Man-hood on the other ſide is honoured and advanced in being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the God-head, and conſequently ſhining with the Glory of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Man-hood of our Saviour participateth of the glory <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the God-head by the Grace of Diſpenſation from the Father. He hath made it to partake of that Glory. And therefore he hath raiſed it up, and ſet it at his own right hand. He hath highly exalted it, he hath crowned it with Glory and Honour. The Father, if you mark it, hath always had a mind to ſet up his Son Chriſt. Not ſo much as he is God, for ſo indeed he doth not need it. But as Man and Mediatour he hath endeavoured every way to raiſe him, and advance him, and make him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the eyes of all the world. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> notes, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.13. <hi>The God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jeſus, whom ye delivered up, and denyed the holy one.</hi> Though you abuſed
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:46169:106"/>
him, and abaſed him, yet God hath glorified him. It is by him, and his means that he is raiſed to ſuch Glory.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Now is it ſo, that even the Man-hood of our Saviour participateth of the Glory whereof the God-head hath been? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then we may take notice of the high Advancement of our nature in the perſon of our Saviour. The very Glory of the God-head is in a ſenſe communicated to it. Our nature ſhareth with the God-head in ſuch incomparable and tranſcendent Glory, as can by no means be expreſt. It is many ways advanced and ſet up in Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>But this, my Brethren, is the heighth and top of all that in him dwelleth, the fulneſs of the God-head bodily,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. Not that the God-head is confined, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within the narrow limits of our Saviours fleſh, or that his body is co-extended with the God-head, as Ubiquitaries dream. But the God-head dwels in Chriſt, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks, not <hi>umbrativè,</hi> by external ſigns, and ſhadows, and tokens of his preſence, as once Chriſt dwelt in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Temple: not <hi>effectivè,</hi> by the effects and operations of its Grace, as now it dwels in the bodies of the Saints, who in the ſame reſpect are called <hi>the Temples of God.</hi> But in him dwels the God head bodily, that is, really united to the humane nature, to the body of our Saviour; And herein Chriſt hath no Peer. It is an high and matchleſs honour, which no other Creature is capable of. By which our nature is advanced in him above all other things and perſons in the world beſides.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo, that even the Man-hood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then as we may take notice here of the advancement of the nature, ſo of our perſonal advancement too, as many of us as belong to Chriſt. For all the Glory of the God-head, with which the Man-hood ſhines, is for us, and our advantage. If he ſanctifie himſelf, it is for our ſakes, as his own expreſſion is. And ſo if he glorifie himſelf, it is for our ſakes too. It is for our ſakes that he prayes, <hi>And now, O Father, Glorifie me with thy ſelf, with the Glory,</hi> &amp;c. For all his Mediatour-ſhip throughout is with ſome reſpect to us. And ſo it is for our ſakes that this unparalelled and matchleſs Glory is conferred upon him. Why, you will ask me, what is our advantage by it? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, It is very great, for we poor men (if we be members of the Lord Chriſt,) do ſhare in this incomparable Glory of the Man-hood of our Saviour, and that partly in fruition, and partly in aſſured expectation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Partly in Fruition, for the preſent we ſhare in this incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glory of the Manhood of our Saviour. For as the Man-hood of our Saviour ſhareth in the glory of the God-head; ſo we, my Brethren, ſhare in the Glory communicated from the God-head to the Man-hood of our Saviour, by reaſon of our Union to them both in the perſon of Chriſt Jeſus. And even as we are puniſht, in that Chriſt is puniſht; and ſanctified, in that Chriſt is ſanctified; ſo we are glorified, in that Chriſt is glorified. We ſhine with the incomparable and dazling Luſtre of the God-head, in that Chriſt ſhines with it. <hi>And as we ſit in Chriſt in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places,</hi> Eph. 2.6. ſo we are glorified in Chriſt with the ſame glory which he had with God the Father before the world was, becauſe he is inveſted with it, as our Head in our fleſh, on our behalf. In him God (having raiſed him up, and glorified him, he) hath glorified us with the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:46169:106"/>
very ſame glory. In him we took poſſeſſion of it. So near and ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble is the union between Chriſt and us, that the Divine and Godlike glory wherewithal he ſhines is truly ours. The members cannot chooſe but ſhare in the glory of the head.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we ſhare in this incomparable glory of the Manhood of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Saviour by aſſured expectation. For as his glory (in anſwer to the Prayer of our Saviour) is now already communicated to the Manhood, ſo far as it is capable of it. So we are certain that the glory of the Man-hood of our Saviour ſhall one day be communicated to us, ſo far as we are able to receive it. We know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him. And that theſe vile bodies ſhall be conformed to his glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. And this ſhould have a double operation and effect upon us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt it ſhould make us to deſpiſe the ſhame of this world, though we be trampled under foot, and made the dung and the off-ſcouring of the Earth; as this is many times the portion of the Saints, our ſpirits ſhould not droop or ſink within us. No, we ſhould bear them up, in ſpight of all the ignominy and contempt that men pour out upon us, and all the venom that they ſpit againſt us. We ſhould endure the reproach, and deſpiſe the ſhame, while we think of this glory. We ſhould not reckon of a little undeſerved ſhame with men, while we conſider that we ſhall ſhortly ſhine with the glory of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly it ſhould cauſe us ſo to walk, that we be not in any thing a ſhame to Chriſt, whom God hath made ſo glorious, and who will ſhortly make us ſo glorious. In whom the humane nature is advanced to ſuch honour, as to partake of the glory of the Godhead. Mark what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Shall I take the members of Chriſt and make them the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of an harlot?</hi> So may I ſay on this occaſion, ſhall I take the nature of Chriſt, the Nature which our Saviour in his Perſon hath ſo highly dignified, and make it in my perſon, the nature of a Devil? Suppoſe a Prince ſhould marry with a mean woman, would he endure to ſee thoſe of her neareſt kindred, her Brethren and her Siſters live like Scullions and like Strumpets in his own eye? Now Chriſt my Brethren hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed our Nature into a nearer union with himſelf then that of marriage, a union which death it ſelf was not able to diſſolve. For when the ſoul was ſeparated from the body, the Godhead was not ſeparated from the one or from the other. It was the Lord that lay buryed in the grave, and he that aſcended into heaven, was the ſame that came down from heaven. And ſhall we then defile this nature by wantonneſs, intemperance and vile affections, which Jeſus Chriſt hath ſo honoured, to take into ſo neer a union with himſelf, and to cauſe it to partake of the glory of the Godhead? Eſpecially if we expect hereafter in our perſons to partake of this glory. Oh let us learn to keep our veſſels in all holineſs and honour. And as we look hereafter to be like him, ſo in the mean time let us puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves as he is pure.</p>

               <p>WE have been very long upon the firſt Part of our Saviours Prayer, and now at length it is ended and diſpatched. Charity begins at home, and ſo our Saviour Chriſt began with his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions for himſelf. For that hath been the ſubſtance of his Prayer hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that as he hath been humbled and abaſed with men, ſo now he might be glorified with his Father. And this he urges very hard with many preſſing arguments; and ſo he ceaſes to ſolicite any further for himſelf.</p>
               <p>Charity begins at home, as I have ſaid, but it doth not end there; Our Saviour is not ſatisfied to put up his Petitions to his Father for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but in the next place he becomes a Suitor alſo for his Church. And here he prayes for his Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the preſent Church. And then for thoſe who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of the Church to come. In the firſt place he prayes for his Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him, the members of the preſent Church, who were already called and ſanctified, whom God had given him out of the world. <hi>I pray for them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I pray not for the world.</hi> In the ſecond place, he prays for thoſe who were after to be called by their preaching, the members of the Church that was to come, in verſ. 20. and ſo on to the concluſion of the Chapter, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt at this time make a little entrance upon our Saviours Prayer in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, who were preſent with him. They were very near to him, they were waiting then upon him, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted immediately by himſelf, and called by his own word, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have the precedency and the preferment in his Prayer.</p>
               <p>And here we have to be conſidered, Firſt the preparation to it, and ſecondly the matter of it. The preparation to this Prayer of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples; Diſcovers firſt, what he himſelf had done in reference to them. And then what they had done in reference to him. What they were, both in relation to himſelf, and to his Father. And where they were, <hi>viz.</hi> In ſuch a place wherein they ſtood in need of his Prayers. Theſe things are interwoven and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt, and we muſt take them in our progreſs as we find them. Only this would be conſidered, that all of them are premiſed by our Saviour, before he puts up one Petition for them, to ſhew what cauſe there was why they ſhould be remembred in his Prayers.</p>
               <p>Begin we with the firſt thing which our Saviour mentions by way of preparation to the Prayer which he makes for his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here you may take notice with me of theſe two particulars.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:46169:107"/>
Firſt; the action of our Saviour in reference to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, of which he minds his Father here, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the deſcription of the perſons to whom he had made known his Fathers Name, <hi>viz.</hi> the men which he had given him out of the world. For opening of the former, we muſt examine and reſolve what is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fathers Name, which Chriſt affirmeth here he had made known, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some think the meaning to be only this, that he had made him known to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, under the notion of a Father. They knew him as a God before, and ſo did generally all the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but as a Father in his Son, they had no acquaintance with him. Now by this Name our Saviour had diſcovered him to thoſe whom he had called and ſanctified, he had brought them now to know him as a Father. This is the title he gives him all along from the beginning of his Prayer to the end, <hi>Father, Holy Father, Righteous Father,</hi> and the like. This is the name by which he repreſents him unto his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and under which he would have them to conceive and apprehend him, as a Father to his Son, and as a Father to themſelves in him, and this is that which he intends (as ſome conceive) in this profeſſion, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is ſomething (I acknowledge) yea, this is very much of that which he intends, but yet I think it is not all. The Name of God in general is all that makes him known to men, wherein ſoever the nature, or the will of God, or whatſoever elſe of God can be imagined or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, is diſcovered and made known, all this is intimated by the Name of God. So that our Saviour in my Text, in ſaying he had manifeſted Gods Name, ſaith in effect, that he had fully manifeſted and revealed his Father to his people. So that there was nothing of him neceſſary to be known, which he had concealed from them. He had not hid one letter of his Name from them. So that the point to be obſerved is this.</p>

                  <p>The Name of God ſometimes imports his Nature, ſometimes his Titles, ſometimes his Attributes, ſometimes his Ordinances, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his works, as I could give you inſtances of all theſe. And all of theſe our Saviour had laid open fully to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to his Father here, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou haſt given me out of the world.</hi>

The proteſtation which he makes to his Apoſtles, when he was about to leave them, runs very much to this purpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.15. <hi>All that I have heard of my Father,</hi> not from my Father, but <hi>of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have made it known to you.</hi> Whatſoever I have been informed in concerning my Father, at leaſt as Mediator, and as the Prophet of my Church, I have diſcovered it to you. I have been very faithful to you in the buſineſs, whatſoever hath been ſhewn me of my Father, for your inſtruction and your information, I have not kept one whit from you. I ſhall add no more for proof, that I may have time to ſhew you, How Jeſus Chriſt hath made this full diſcovery, and then why Jeſus Chriſt hath made this full diſcovery of his Father to his people. And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of the latter, I ſhall examine and reſolve why Jeſus Chriſt, and none but he hath made it. And in the ſecond place, why the diſcovery he hath made is ſuch an abſolute and full diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe, how Jeſus Chriſt hath made ſuch a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Father. This will be neceſſary to be known, for the diſtincter underſtanding of the point: And he hath made it principally three ways: by his Perſonal appearance in the fleſh; by his Word; and by his Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt by his Perſonal appearance in the fleſh, our Saviour Chriſt hath made ſome diſcovery of his Father. Jeſus Chriſt as he is Man, and as he hath aſſummed our Nature, is the Image and reſemblance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is that which the Apoſtle aims at, when he ſaith, <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God, Col.</hi> 1.15. by which he intimates expreſly, that however God be in himſelf inviſible, yet there is ſome reſemblance of him in the Lord Chriſt, ſo that he may be ſeen in him. It's true indeed, that Jeſus Chriſt as God is the inviſible Image of God, and thus he is the very picture of the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. But as he hath aſſumed our fleſh, he is the viſible Image of God. And this is clearly the Apoſtles meaning when he ſaith, <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God.</hi> His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is not to declare how Jeſus Chriſt is the inviſible Image of God the Father from Eternity, but viſible to us in time. And hence he ſaith not ſimply, who <hi>is the Image</hi> of God, but <hi>of the inviſible God.</hi> In which there is a cloſe Antitheſis. <hi>q. d.</hi> Having aſſumed our Nature, he is now become the viſible <hi>Image of the inviſible God.</hi> That God who is inviſible, is made viſible in him. And this is that which is ſuggeſted, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> you may conceive it with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eye, <hi>the Son of Man who came out of the boſome of the Father hath declared him.</hi> He hath diſcovered him in ſome reſpect to that eye. And therefore when our Saviour was incarnate, it is ſaid, <hi>that God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſh,</hi> which is the object of the eye of ſenſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. So that he that had looked upon him, might have ſeen the Father in him. In which reſpect it is, that when <hi>Philip</hi> was ſo earneſt to have the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewn him, our Saviour bid him to behold himſelf, and addeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father alſo,</hi> Joh. 14.9. This is the Viſion mentioned in the Book of <hi>Iob, I know that my Redeemer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> Not in my ſpirit, or my underſtanding only, but <hi>my fleſh:</hi> yea, and I ſhall look on him, not with other, but
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:46169:108"/>
                     <hi>with theſe ſame eyes.</hi> Which can be no other way, but in the glorified Body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly Chriſt hath made a diſcovery of his Father by his Word, and by his Goſpel. There he hath ſhewed him forth to men, ſo far as it is neceſſary that he ſhould be known by them. And this is partly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in that ſpeech of his to <hi>Philip,</hi> Joh. 14.9, 10. <hi>How ſaiſt thou ſhew us the Father? Believeſt thou not that I am in the Father; and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in me? The words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, ſaith Chriſt.</hi> My manner is not to be ſpeaking to you of my ſelf ſo much, as of my Father, nor to advance my ſelf ſo much, as to ſet up my Father upon all occaſions. And how then is it that you that have ſo long converſed with me, and have heard ſo much from me, are yet ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Father? If you obſerve the manner of our Saviours teaching and diſcourſing, you ſhall find that he inſiſted very much on matters that concerned his Father, he was always talking of him, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he was drawing near his paſſion, and ready to depart from his Diſciples, he laboured very much to make his Father better known to them. And when he was about to leave them, he profeſſed that he had perfectly acquainted them with all things that concern his Father, ſo far as they were come to his knowledge for the inſtruction and the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people. Indeed the word of Chriſt, the Goſpel, containeth in it all things that are neceſſary to be known of God the Father, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Nature, or his Will, or his Son, or his Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>it is able</hi> (of it ſelf without addition) <hi>to make us wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. This is a perfect and a full diſcovery, ſo that we need no other knowledge of the Lord to bring us to ſalvation then that which is revealed to us in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly Chriſt makes a full diſcovery of his Father by his Spirit. And this is that which is the Complement of all in this buſineſs. Indeed there is a full diſcovery of him in the Word, materially there is nothing wanting there; But it is not full to us without the revelation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Chriſt ſhews his Father there, in all his glory, excellency, over-flowing love to his people. But if the Spirit do not cure the blindneſs of our eyes, and open them, and take away the vail that is upon them, we can never ſee him. It is the Comforter the holy Ghoſt that teaches all things, conceive it efficaciouſly and with ſucceſs, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.28. who comes out from the Father, and makes known the Fathers Name to his people. Thus we have ſeen how Jeſus Chriſt makes this diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee why Jeſus Chriſt makes this diſcovery of his Father; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And here you may remember I propounded two things. Firſt why Jeſus Chriſt and none but he makes this diſcovery: And ſecondly why the diſcovery which he makes, is ſuch an abſolute and full diſcovery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, as for the firſt of theſe, Why Jeſus Chriſt and none but he makes this diſcovery. There are two weighty reaſons for it: For firſt, none but he is able. And next, none but he is fit to make it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt none but Jeſus Chriſt is able to make this full diſcovery of his Father; For none but he is perfectly acquainted with him. Alas all men are ſtrangers to the Father, the worſt men abſolutely and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:46169:109"/>
and the beſt in ſome meaſure. And all the knowledge which any ſoul hath of him, it hath from Jeſus Chriſt too. But now my Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt hath the full knowledge of his Father, he doth not know him outwardly alone, but he knows his very heart, and the ſecrets of his boſom. And therefore he is ſaid to lodge there, and ſo to be the only poſſible revealer of the Father to the world. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him,</hi> Joh. 1.18. How is it poſſible for any one to make the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known, unleſs he know him? Now this is proper and peculiar to the Son. <hi>No man knows the Father but the Son,</hi> that is, originally, primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively of himſelf, and therefore it is added preſently, <hi>and he to whom the Son will reveal him,</hi> Joh. 11.27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly as none but Chriſt is able, ſo none but Chriſt is fit to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his Father to his people. He is the only Mediator between God and man, there is but one, as the Apoſtle tells us, and that is Chriſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. And therefore it is congruous that he ſhould manage and tranſact the buſineſs, all the buſineſs between God and man, that all ſhould go through his hands. He is to make God friends with us, and to make us friends with God, the peace muſt be on both ſides. And how ſhall he effect the latter, but by revealing and making known his Father to us, in all his beauty, and his glory, and his excellency in himſelf; in all the tenderneſs and dearneſs of his love to us, and ſo to joyn our hearts to him. This latter is eſpecially the Name of God, which Chriſt was (as a Saviour) to diſcover, <hi>viz.</hi> his attributes of Love and Mercy. This was the proper work of Chriſt indeed, to manifeſt this Name of God, all that is ſweet and lovely in him to his people.</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice to let you know, why Jeſus Chriſt and none but he makes this diſcovery of the Father to his people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We have but one thing yet behind, why the diſcovery that he makes is ſuch an abſolute and full diſcovery? I give you but two reaſons of it, and I have done for this time: he doth it in the firſt place that he may be faithful, and in the next place that diſcovery which he makes may be effectual.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He makes a full diſcovery, that he may be faithful as the Prophet of his Church. For if he ſhould not ſhew his Father to us fully, if he ſhould hide any thing of God from us, which it concerneth us to know, how ſhould he be a faithful Prophet to us? And even as if he ſhould not make compleat and perfect ſatisfaction for us, he ſhould not be a faithful Prieſt; So if he ſhould not give compleat inſtruction to us, he ſhould not be a faithful Prophet. Indeed his Father hath appointed him, my Brethren, to make known his Name, every letter of his Name to his people, and hence he gives him this account, when he is even about to leave the world. <hi>I have manifeſted,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He makes a full diſcovery of his Father to his people, that the diſcovery which he makes may be effectual. For if he ſhould conceal the leaſt particle, the leaſt iota of his Fathers Name, which is required to be known <hi>neceſsitate medii,</hi> to ſalvation, all the reſt that he revealeth would be in vain, it would be to no purpoſe. If he make not a full diſcovery,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:46169:109"/>
(in the ſenſe that I have ſaid) it were as good that he made none at all. And therefore that he may attain the end for which he came into the world, for which he executes his Mediatorſhip in all the offices, and branches of it, even the Salvation of his people, he makes his Father ſo far known to every one of his, that nothing may be hidden from them; in the ignorance of which, whoſoever dies, muſt periſh.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt hath made an abſolute, compleat, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The leſs are they to be excuſed, and the more to be condemned, who yet continue ignorant of God, of his Nature, and his Will, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this diſcovery. Though Jeſus Chriſt hath done ſo much to make his Father known to them, yet they continue wholly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him. They are meer ſtrangers to the Father, they do not know ſo much as a Letter of his Name, which Chriſt hath made ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. And this is very evident, becauſe they do not love him, they do not truſt in him, which they would be ſure to do, if they did know the Name of God. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. And ſo it may be ſaid as well they that know thy Name will love thee, and they that know thy Name will fear thee. It is impoſſible but mens affections ſhould be managed and moulded by their apprehenſions, and that the principles which they have rooted in their underſtandings ſhould have ſome influence, and operation on their hearts. So that if men did but know the wrath of God, it could not be but they would fear him, if they did know the power of God, and know it as engaged for them, it could not be but they would truſt him and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him. If they did know the love, and mercy, the beauty and the excellency of the Lord, it could not be but they would love him. But while they ſhew forth none of this, it is apparent that the Fathers Name (of which theſe are but divers Letters as it were) is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown to them. Now, my Beloved, when the Lord ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, to render vengeance unto them that know not God, what will become of thoſe men? Alas their unacquaintance with him (now Chriſt hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Name ſo plainly) will be void of all excuſe. If Jeſus Chriſt had kept his Father cloſe, if he had hid his Name, his Love, his Power, his Mercy, and the like, and had not manifeſted it to men, they might have pleaded ſomething when the day of reckoning comes. They might have ſaid, alas it is no wonder that the Father is unknown to us, for which way ſhould we come to be acquainted with him? He dwells in light, that no man can approach unto, whom no man hath ſeen, or can ſee. But then Chriſt Jeſus will be ready to reply, it was a great part of my errand and my buſineſs down into the world, to help men to the ſight of him, to manifeſt his Name to men. And I have done it fully and compleatly, and therefore if you know him not, your ſin is wilful, and your damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be heavy.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt hath made an abſolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then let us bleſs <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> and magnifie the Lord Chriſt, that he hath done this neceſſary work for us, that he hath ſhewed his Father, and made known his Name to us. We are all of us by nature ſtrangers to him, and of our ſelves we
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:46169:110"/>
have no means to be acquainted with him. Indeed by nature we may come to have ſome knowledge of a God, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. But the knowledge of the Father in reference to Jeſus Chriſt, and to his people, is another thing. To know God as a Father to his Son Chriſt, and in and through Chriſt to us, to know him by this Name of his, is unattainable by any light but that which we receive from Chriſt himſelf. So that unleſs he had diſcovered him, we had never known the Father, and ſo had periſhed everlaſtingly. <hi>No man knoweth the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him, Matth.</hi> 11.27. And therefore we are infinitely bound to Jeſus Chriſt that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed him to us, that he hath made ſuch an abſolute and full diſcovery of his Father to his people, which if he had not done, they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtrangers to him, both in this world, and in that which is to come. Indeed we might have known him as an angry and a powerful God, we might know him as a Judge and an avenger without any help from Chriſt. But as a ſweet and gracious Father, we had never known him, if Chriſt had not diſcovered him in ſuch a way, and under ſuch a notion to us. This Name of his none but Jeſus Chriſt could teach us, we could have learned to ſpell and underſtand it of no other Maſter in this world. And therefore we are bound the more to Chriſt, and his mercy is the greater, that he hath undertaken to inſtruct us, and make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this ſweet Leſſon, which is indeed the firſt and greateſt in the Primmer of Religion, the Name of the Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Is it ſo, That Jeſus Chriſt hath made an abſolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then let us be perſwaded to addreſs our ſelves to the performance of that neceſſary duty, which this ſo large ſo ample a diſcovery of the Father calls for. <hi>viz.</hi> To grow up in the knowledge of him, and not to reſt, till we be inwardly and throughly acquainted with him. That as the revelation of him in it ſelf is very full, ſo it may be ſo to us too. Beloved, Jeſus Chriſt hath done his work as he profeſſes to his Father in my Text, <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I have brought it forth ſaith he, into the light, and ſet it in open view, for ſo much that word imports. By which he intimateth, that his Fathers Name was like a rare and curious piece behinde a curtain, like a rich treaſure covered, or a glorious Image vailed. But now ſaith Chriſt, the vail is taken off, the covering is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the curtain drawn. I have expoſed my Fathers Name to the veiw of all my people. This Chriſt hath done, you ſee, and now let us conſider what we are to do. No queſtion he hath brought it forth that we might ſee it, that we might feed our eyes upon it, that we might grow up in the knowledge of his Fathers Name, of the dearneſs of his love, and the ſweetneſs of his mercy, the tenderneſs and the abundance of his compaſſions unto poor loſt creatures. This is the Name which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath manifeſted to us that we might be acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, let us not by neglecting this diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, go about to fruſtrate Chriſt, and do as much as in us lies to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him of his purpoſe. Oh let us labour that our knowledge of the Name of God, may be in ſome ſort anſwerable to the revelation that Jeſus Chriſt hath made of it. And that as we have (ſince our Saviours
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46169:110"/>
coming in the fleſh) a fuller, and a more compleat diſcovery of it then they in former ages had, we may accordingly exceed and go beyond them in the knowledge of it too. We may know more of God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of his love, and of his mercy to his people in his Son, then they did. Or if it be not ſo, to what end is the pains that Chriſt hath taken to manifeſt his Fathers Name to us? Oh let us be aſhamed to come behind the Saints of the Old Teſtament in the knowledge of this Name, who came behind us in the means of this knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, That Jeſus Chriſt hath made an abſolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then let us ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> our ſelves with the diſcovery he hath made. And let us not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or undertake to know more of the Father then he hath made known to us. Indeed if Jeſus Chriſt had fallen ſhort in this diſcovery, it were but reaſon that we ſhould exceed and go beyond it. If he had not told us all that is fit for us to know, it were a congruous thing that we ſhould ſtrive to know more: But ſeeing the diſcovery he hath made is ſo compleat and abſolute in all reſpects, ſo that there can be nothing added to it, we have cauſe to reſt in it, and to content our ſelves with ſo much knowledge of the Father as he hath revealed to us.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is an itch in Nature to ſearch into thoſe things (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concerning God) which are concealed and hid from us. Fain we would ſee his face, when Chriſt hath manifeſted but his back-parts to us, we would know more of his Nature, of his Counſels and Decrees, the order of them, the meaſure of them, the objects of them, then he hath thought expedient to reveal to us. We would approach too nigh to gaze, we would intrude on thoſe things which we have not ſeen, for which we have no revelation, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. And this my Brethren, is the evill Genius of theſe very times, men go beyond themſelves in ſifting into things concerning God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Chriſt too: I mean beyond any thing that he hath manifeſted of his Father to them. Indeed they tell us that Chriſt reveals it to them by his Spirit. But that is not the Spirit of Chriſt which ſhews us any thing beyond what he hath written in his Word. The buſineſs of the Spirit is not to bring us any other truths then thoſe which are revealed in the Word, but to clear thoſe to us. If any ſpirit bring us any thing, croſſing with, or but ſo much as diverſe from the Scripture, if an Angel dropt from Heaven teach us any other Doctrine, he muſt not be believed, but accurſed. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. If any man or Angel ſpeak not according to this Word, let him pretend what light he will, it is becauſe there is no light in him. And therefore let us ſatisfie our ſelves with that which Chriſt hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted of his Father in his Word, and in his Goſpel. Since his diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſo full, let us not ſeek to go beyond it. That ſpeech of God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> who (whether he were curious or no) was very earneſt to behold his glory, is obſervable, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19. <hi>I will make all my good go before thee,</hi> (that is) I will diſcover ſo much of my ſelf to thee, as ſhall be good for thee to know. And this our Saviour Chriſt hath done com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly. We need no further knowledge of the Father here to make us happy, to make us wiſe unto ſalvation. And therefore let us reſt in it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is a fruit and evidence of pride to ſtrive to know more of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Name then Chriſt hath manifeſted to us. It proceeds from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be obſerved, as having ſomething more then ordinary in us, and this hath much prevailed with many men in theſe times; to know no more of God then Chriſt hath ſhewed us in the Scripture, this is no ſuch great matter, this will never make them famous. And therefore they muſt have their nice and curious ſpeculations by themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond any written word, they muſt have hidden things diſcovered to them, which other men are not acquainted with, that they may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be men of ſingular depth, and extraordinary intercourſe with the Spirit of Chriſt. This the Apoſtle notes in thoſe Impoſtors, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Intruding into thoſe things which they have not ſeen.</hi> But how comes this to paſs? vainly puffed up by their fleſhly mind. There is the cauſe of this intruſion. And hence the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> to ſhew that he was not proud and haughty, makes this the evidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. <hi>I do not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe my ſelf in things that are too high for me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is a grievous ſin to labour to know more of God then Chriſt hath manifeſted to us. It is no better then intruſion on the right of God himſelf, ſuch a man doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the fore-alledged Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. Intrudes upon anothers right, enters on the poſſeſſion of another. Now whoſe poſſeſſion are theſe ſecret things? To whom do they belong? to God ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 29. ult. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed belong unto us and unto our children.</hi> So that while we content our ſelves with theſe revealed things, we are like honeſt-minded men, that keep and uſe their own, and love not to encroach upon their neighbours. But if we be not ſatisfied with the things which God hath manifeſted and revealed of himſelf, as thinking them too narrow and too mean a purchaſe for us, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly go on to ſearch, and dive, and pry into his reſerved ſecrets which he hath locked and ſealed up, we go beyond our own, and enter upon his poſſeſſion. And this is that which the Apoſtle notes in theſe ſeducers, they entred and intruded into thoſe things which they had not ſeen, for which they had no revelation from the Lord, no demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Scriptures, they were not things allowed for them to know, and ſo their medling with them was intruſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And as it is a ſinful thing, ſo it is a dangerous thing to labour to know more of God then he hath manifeſted to us. It is a matter of extream hazard. The people of the <hi>Jews</hi> you know had certain bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet them, at the promulgation of the Law, beyond which none of them might dare to ſtep, no, not a foot to gaze or pry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.21. Their ground was meaſured out, and ſo was Gods; ſo much he allowed to them, and ſo much he reſerved to himſelf; as long as they contained themſelves within their compaſs they were ſafe. But if out of a curious diſpoſition any man adventured into Gods precincts, there was no other way but death. So God hath ſet us bounds and limits in our knowledge of himſelf, ſo much he allows to us, and ſo much he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to himſelf. So long as we contain our ſelves within the bounds
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:46169:111"/>
of things revealed, we are ſafe, for they are ours, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us. But if out of a vain deſire to gaze and pry, we enter upon ſecret things, we have intruded upon Gods peculiar, and we may juſtly fear his ſtroke.</p>
                  <p>Conſider it is a fruitleſs thing to labour to know more of God then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he hath manifeſted to us, for more of him cannot be known. And to ſeek to know more, is the direct and ready way to loſe that which we know already; to preſs too near to gaze upon him, is to have our eyes darkened, till at laſt we ſee nothing. <hi>Excellens viſibile deſtruit ſenſum.</hi> He dwelleth in light that no man can approach unto, and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting us to labor for the knowledge of the Lord, and of his will, adviſes us withall <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not to be wiſe above that which is meet, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Adam</hi> had a mind to know as much of God, as God himſelf, and by this means he came to know nothing. And truly it is juſt with God to ſuffer ſuch to err and wander in their vain imaginations, who would be ſo overwiſe, till they become meer fools, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt hath made an abſolute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then let us live <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> and walk like men that have this rich diſcovery made to us. Like men that know the Fathers Name. <hi>All people will walk, every one in the Name of his God,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah, Mic.</hi> 4.5. And why ſhould not we add as he, and we will walk in the Name of our God for ever and ever. I ſhall perſwade you to it eſpecially in two Caſes, in times of ſinful and of poenal miſery.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt when we are under ſinful miſery, by reaſon of the guilt and power of our tranſgreſſions, let us walk like men that have the Fathers Name made known to us. We are apt in ſuch a caſe ſometimes to caſt away all hopes of pardon and forgiveneſs, to think that mercy is too narrow for us; to ſay to God as <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>Depart from us, for we are ſinful men.</hi> Why, my Beloved, do you know the Fathers Name, the Name which he himſelf proclaimed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 34.6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, patient and long-ſuffering, merciful and gratious, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, tranſgreſsion and ſin.</hi> All ſorts, all kinds, and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſin. And can you doubt whether there be enough of mercy in him to cure your ſinful miſery? What do you want, or what can you deſire that is not to be found in his Name? Are your ſins many for the number of them, and great for the meaſure of them? The mercies of the Lord are more and greater, he is abundant in goodneſs and truth. Are they of divers ſorts, and divers kinds? He forgiveth iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and ſin. Have they been long continued and held out againſt God? He is gratious and long-ſuffering. Somewhat there is in Gods Name to anſwer all objections of the humble ſoul, and to keep it from deſpair, when iniquities do look moſt horrid, and moſt black up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So in the ſecond place when we are under poenal miſery, let us walk like men that have the Fathers Name made known to us. What ever our diſtreſſes be, either perſonal or National, let us not give all for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:46169:112"/>
loſt, as moſt are very apt to do. Oh we ſhall never be delivèred. There is no other way, but we muſt ſink in this affliction. Why, my Beloved, do you know the Name of God, do you know his power and mercy? How is it then that you have ſo little faith? That you depend no more upon him? mark what the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>They that know thy Name will put their truſt in thee.</hi> And therefore while you are ſo diffident and faithleſs, it is too apparent that you are not ſo well acquainted with the Fathers Name, as you might and ought to be. Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, take in the diſcoveries that Chriſt hath made of this Name. And when you are in any miſery, in any ſinful, in any poenal miſery, hide your ſelves in the Name of the Lord your God.</p>

               <p>AND thus far of our Saviours action, in reference to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, of which he minds his Father here, <hi>I have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thy Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Proceed we now to his deſcription of the perſons, to whom he had made known his Fathers Name, <hi>The men which thou gaveſt me out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Father gives men to his Son Chriſt, either for outward admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, or elſe for inward union and incorporation. Either to be his ſervants, or to be his members. Our Saviour clearly ſpeaks of thoſe that were beſtowed on him in the latter way, to be united to him as living members of his body. And this is very evident, becauſe he ſaith, that they were given him out of the world. They that were beſtowed upon him only for outward miniſtration as <hi>Judas</hi> was; Or only in regard of outward profeſſion, as many others were, were given him. So that they were of the world ſtill. They were a part of the unbelieving world, and of the wicked world, the world that lies in wickedneſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this donation. But as for them who did in deed and truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and were by faith incorporated into Jeſus Chriſt, they were the men that were given him out of the world. That is, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him. So that they were ſevered, ſeparated from the world, they were no longer of the wicked unbelieving world, but of another party, that were divided and diſtinguiſhed from the world. In the world they were indeed, but they were not of the world. And theſe are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently they, of whom our Saviour ſpeaks in this place. <hi>The men whom thou gaveſt me out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to thoſe he here affirmeth that he had manifeſted and made known his Fathers Name. And you muſt underſtand it to be ſpoken by our Saviour here excluſively. <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world,</hi> that is, to them and none others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:46169:112"/>Why, did not Chriſt make known his Fathers name to all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction? Did he not Preach to all? Did he not open and unfold his Fathers love and mercy, and the like, to all the multitude that came to hear him? He did indeed as to the outward Promulgation, but not as to the inward and effectual revelation. He did not manifeſt it by his Spirit ſavingly to all: No my Beloved, this was the Priviledge but of a few, and in particular of thoſe who were beſtowed upon him by his Father to be Members of his body: So ſaith our Saviour to his Father here, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world:</hi> To them, and not to others; or elſe at leaſt to them ſo, as I have not done to others. They have a Priviledge in this reſpect, which others are not made partakers of: I have made it known to them effectually and ſaving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not to others.</p>
               <p>You ſee the meaning of the words; the Points to be obſerved are two: Firſt, There are ſome certain men, whom God the Father gives to Ieſus Chriſt out of the world. Secondly, that Ieſus Chriſt doth make his Father known effectually and ſavingly to them, and none beſides them. At this time of the firſt.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> There are ſome certain men, whom God the Father gives to Jeſus Chriſt out of the World.</head>
                  <p>In proſecution of this Obſervation, I ſhall diſtinctly evidence and clear theſe four things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There are ſome men, whom God the Father giveth to Jeſus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are a certain number of them.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They are of the World before the Father gives them to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Son: And</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, After they are given up to Jeſus Chriſt, they are of the world no longer. All theſe particulars are wrapt up in the Obſervation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and the Text, as I ſhall ſhew you briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There are ſome men whom God the Father gives to Jeſus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt: So he himſelf deſcribes the perſons to whom he manifeſts his Fathers name, not by their inward diſpoſition, not by their outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or condition, but by the Act of God upon them, or concerning them, his giving them to Jeſus Chriſt. They are the men, ſaith he, <hi>whom thou gaveſt me:</hi> So that ſome have this priviledge, you ſee, above the reſt of loſt mankinde, that God the Father gives them to his Son Chriſt, and gives them to him in a ſpecial manner, as I ſhewed you even now, not to be his Servants only, but to be his Members too. He beſtows them upon Chriſt to be his own peculiar people. I will not ſtay on this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath been largely handled heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Now for the ſecond thing, there are a certain number of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them; there are ſome certain men, whom God the Father gives to Chriſt: They are thus many, not a perſon more or leſs: The number of them is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46169:113"/>
exactly known to God and Chriſt; he knows how many of them there be to a man. And hence our Saviour ſpeaks of them in ſuch a way, as being able to diſtinguiſh them from all the world beſides. I have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted thy name unto the men <hi>whom thou gaveſt me out of the world.</hi> And ſo he tels us that he knows his <hi>ſheep that are given him of his Father,</hi> as his own expreſſion is, <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 29. And yet he calls his ſheep by name, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. and in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe of this very Chapter; <hi>I pray for them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me.</hi> So that our Saviour Chriſt diſtinguiſhes you ſee; he knows who are his own by free donation of his Father, and for them he prays. He knows who are not given him, and for them he prays not. There are a certain number of them known to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, now this ſelected Company are of the world before the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives them to the Son: I do not mean before he gives them by E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, but before he gives them to him by actual union and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And therefore they are ſaid expreſly to be given to Jeſus Chriſt out of the World; ſo that the World is always beforehand with Jeſus Chriſt in this regard. The World hath the poſſeſsion of them firſt, and afterwards they come to appertain to Jeſus Chriſt. In the firſt place they are the worlds, as all unſanctifyed and unregenerated perſons are, and then at length they come to be the Lords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, and then when they are once the Lords, they are no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the world, which is the laſt thing in the point. They are given Jeſus Chriſt out of the world, and conſequently when he hath them once, they are not of it, they are no longer men of this World. As for the reſt that are not actually beſtowed on Chriſt, they are Inhabitants, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwellers of the earth, as they are often ſtiled in the Revelation; they are the men of this World, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> calls them, who have their portion in this preſent life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. <hi>They are not of the Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>but of the World,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. <hi>They are of the world, therefore ſpeak they of the world, and the world heareth them,</hi> John 4.5. But they that are delivered up to Jeſus Chriſt and become his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they are of the World no longer. And this the Saints in Scripture have confeſſed, that they were Strangers, Pilgrims, Sojourners in this World, and therefore looked for, and made towards their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.6. <hi>I am a ſtranger on the earth,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal, 119.196. not in his place of baniſhment alone with the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> but in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> too, yea in his houſe, yea in his bed, yea any where upon the earth, he was a Stranger, he counted not himſelf at home in any place but heaven only: To ſay the truth, the world lays no claim at all to thoſe that belong to Chriſt; and therefore this will need no great proof: It doth not own them, or acknowledge them for hers: but rather caſts them out and perſecutes them, and doth them all the ſpight and miſchief that it can. And this evinceth manifeſtly, that they are not the Worlds, as Chriſt himſelf informeth his Diſciples upon the very ſame ground, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own; but becauſe you are not of the world; but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:46169:113"/>To open this a little further to you, becauſe it is the great thing of the Doctrine and the Text, that they that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, are given him out of the world, and ſo are of the world no longer, I ſhall make it to appear in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>They that are actually given up to Jeſus Chriſt to be his Members,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> are actually dead with Chriſt, and conſequently they are out of this world. We uſe to ſay of men when they are dead, that they are gone, they are departed out of this world. The ſame may be affirmed (in a ſenſe) of thoſe who are dead with Jeſus Chriſt. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If ye be dead with Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, (as that he takes for granted and ſuppoſed) why as though living in the world, <hi>are ye ſubject to Ordinances?</hi> He reaſons there from the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ſtate of the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> on whom thoſe worldly Ordinances were impoſed: They were dead in relation to the world, they lived not in the world, and therefore were not to be burthened (in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at leaſt) with the inventions and conſtitutions of the world. Law is the rule of life and action, ſo that where there is a ceſſation of life, there is no further obligation of the Law, becauſe there is no action in a dead man to be ordered by it. <hi>Know ye not</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> chap. 7.1. <hi>that the Law hath Dominion over a man ſo long as he liveth?</hi> So long and no longer; for aſſoon as he is dead he is looſed from the Law, as it is added there in that place. It were a ſenſeleſs thing to lay Commandements on the carriages of men, and to exact obedience from them after they are dead. <hi>But ye are dead</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>dead to the world,</hi> and therefore theſe unlawful Ordinances ought not to be impoſed upon you by the world. They ſhould not burthen you with theſe things, for this is not the Countrey that you live in. And in another place the Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelf, ſaith he was <hi>crucified to the world, Gal.</hi> 6.6, 14. not only dead, but crucified to it, and ſo he was no more of this world.</p>
                  <p>They that are actually given up to Jeſus Chriſt to be his members, as they are actually dead, and ſo departed out of this world, ſo they are actually living in another world. <hi>You are dead</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. and what follows? you are not ſo dead, that you do not live at all, but you do not live here, no you live above with God, <hi>You are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> Their converſation is indeed in heaven, as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, their life is Angel-like, they walk with God as <hi>Noah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. They are with him in the Palace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.15. Others are abroad in the Town or in the Countrey, but theſe men are in houſe with him; they are without doors, but theſe are within; ſuch faithful ſouls have fellowſhip with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. They are far from God, and far from Jeſus Chriſt by Nature, they dwell a great way from him, as the Prodigal in a ſtrange Countrey, and ſo have no commerce with him. But when they are converted and given up to Chriſt, they are made nigh, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.13. When peace is once effectually preached to thoſe that are afar off, they have acceſs by one Spirit to the Father, and ſo they are no longer forreigners
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46169:114"/>
and ſtrangers, but fellow-Citizens of the Saints and of the houſhold of God. Indeed my Brethren, whatſoever they that are beſtowed on Chriſt do in regard of their natural life, yet in regard of their ſpiritual life, they do not live ſo properly in this world, as in the other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that reſpect are out of this world, as I ſhall ſhew you in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is no life but is accompanyed with ſome relation to thoſe that have the ſame alliance, and deſcent and Original of life. Now true it is, that they that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, in regard of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, have natural parents and kindred, and allies in this world. But in regard of their ſpiritual life, they have ſpiritual parents and kindred in another world: Their Father that begat them, God, is of another world; Their Mother that conceived and bare them, and gave them ſuck, the Church, is of another world. <hi>The new Jeruſalem which is above is free, which is the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4.26. Their Brethren and their ſpecial friends, that are united to them in the neareſt bond and tie of grace, are of another world. So that their chief relations are above in heaven. And whereſoever they may ſojourn for a Seaſon, there they live where their Father, and their Mother, and their Brethren, and their choice Relations are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is no life but is accompanyed with ſome place of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (though in ſome I muſt acknowledge it may be more unſetled then in others) and with ſome means of ſuſtentation. Now it is very true, that they that are given up to Chriſt, in regard of their natural life may have an earthly habitation, and earthly means of ſuſtentation, and ſo in that reſpect they may be yet in this world. But in regard of their ſpiritual life, their manſion houſe is in another world, as the Apoſtle tels us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>They have a building with God, a houſe not made with hands, but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in heaven.</hi> The means which they ſubſiſt upon, by which this life is nouriſhed, and maintained, are not any earthly things; They feed upon the bread which comes from heaven, which was prefigured by the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, with reference to which the Pſalmiſt ſaith, that man did eat Angels food. <hi>My Father gives you the true bread from heaven,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6.32. And what is that? <hi>I am the bread,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that came down from heaven,</hi> at ver. 41. This bread all they that appertain to Chriſt do eat, by faith, and of his blood do they drink, and ſo the life of grace is ſtrengthened in them. And for the eſtate they live upon, the main poſſeſſion, it lies not here but in another world. <hi>In Chriſt they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo in him they ſit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in heavenly places.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no life but is accompanyed with ſome action. Now they that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, may in regard of their natural life, act in and with, and for this world. They may in many things do as worldly men do, they may labour in their callings, they may deal in the affairs, and trade in the Commodities of this world, for the procuring of ſubſiſtence here. But in regard of their ſpiritual life, their actings are in and for another world. Their minds and thoughts do work exceedingly on heaven and heavenly things. Their hearts are always running out to God
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46169:114"/>
and Chriſt, and the happineſs above, and feeding upon ſuch objects. They are too large to be contained within the narrow limits of this lower world; no, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, they are continually with God. With the woman, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.1. They tread upon the Moon, this variable and inconſtant world; they trample with an holy ſcorn upon theſe earthly things. They are aſpiring ſtill to heaven, walking and acting heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Indeed they live in ſome reſpect in this world, but it is but as though they lived in the world, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>They uſe the world, but yet it is as though they uſed it not,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29. They lay not out the ſtrength of their affections and endeavours upon theſe things: But on the matters of the other world, there they are intent indeed, there they are in good earneſt, there they act with full vigor; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> their Trading, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, their Dealing, their Negotiation is in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. The word there uſed hath very much in it, and can hardly be expreſſed. <hi>Beza</hi> aſſaies in many wayes: The manner of our living is in Heaven, or which comes nearer yet, we carry and demean our ſelves as Citizens of Heaven. As if Heaven were a City, and we (as being free there) do walk and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Manners, and the Cuſtoms, and the Laws, and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the City we belong to. So that the Saints you ſee do live as if they were in Heaven already, as being now no more of this world.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo my Brethren, That there are ſome certain men whom God <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> the Father gives to Jeſus Chriſt out of the world? Are they the worlds before they come to be the Lord Chriſts by the donation of the Father? Here then you ſee the reaſon my beloved, why there is ſuch a ſtir ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when God is giving men to Jeſus Chriſt, and why the buſineſs meets with ſo much heat and oppoſition. You cannot but take notice what a fray is often made, when any one is about to leave the world, and to cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt. Carnal Parents, Brethren, Siſters, Friends, Acquaintance, by and by are up as it were in arms againſt it. When the Apoſtles were bringing men to Jeſus Chriſt, at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> you know my Brethren, it occaſioned ſuch an uproar in the City, and ſuch a mutiny among the Tradeſmen and Mechanicks there, as you can hardly parallel in any ſtory. You ſhall obſerve in the New Teſtament, when Chriſt began to gather people to himſelf, that whereſoever there were any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers given to him by the Father, ſome were exceedingly diſquieted &amp; out of patience at it. It galled the Phariſees, and cut them to the very hearts, that Jeſus Chriſt had ſuch an harveſt among the people there: why (ſay they in a great paſſion) the whole world runs after him: And ſo it is to this day, and will be to the worlds end, when God is pleaſed to give in ſouls to Jeſus Chriſt in any place, ſome will fret and ſtorm at it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any wonder that they ſhould, for they are given him out of the world. And the world is loth to loſe that which appertains to it, and which is its own poſſeſſion. If God did give a people to his Son, to which the world had no right, and to which it could pretend no title, the world would like it well enough, it would never be againſt it. But this is that which vexes it, and troubles it, that God muſt give away that which is his (the worlds) to Jeſus Chriſt. He cannot have a man, but the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:46169:115"/>
world muſt be a loſer, who cannot keep his own for him: what hath any one to do to meddle with that which is the worlds known right, to fetch away that which hath many years (perhaps) belonged to him? This is an injury (as he conceives) that puts him out of all patience; and this is that which makes him ſtrive and ſtruggle as he doth. Chriſt enters upon every ſoul that is beſtowed upon him by his Father, by diſpoſſeſſing and diſſeazing him: ſo that it is no marvel though he be extreamly ſtartled, and though he labour every way by promiſes and by preferments on the one ſide, and by threatning, and by perſecutions on the other, to keep that which he hath in his poſſeſſion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Are there ſome certain men whom God the Father gives to Jeſus Chriſt out of the world? So that however they were once the worlds, now they are the worlds no longer. By this let us examine and reſolve, whether we be given up to Chriſt or no? It is an admirable priviledge, an high prerogative for any ſoul to belong to Jeſus Chriſt, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him by the Father. It carries in it all the happineſs that is attainable by any Creature. Now would you know whether the Father have actually given you to Chriſt or no? Conſider whether you be out of this world; whether it may be truly ſaid of you, that you were once indeed of this world, you lived here, builded tabernacles here, your hearts, and your affections, and your chief delights were here. But now the caſe is altered with you, you are no longer of this world, but of another.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may be able to diſcover this, I ſhall give you marks for tryal.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If you be out of the world, you are not faſhioned and conformed to this world in the unlawful waies, and practices, and courſes of it. You faſhion not your ſelves according to this world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. not as this world doth. As Turks and Spaniards are not like to Engliſh men, they have another kind of viſage, another garb, another habit, and the like. So they that are given up unto Chriſt out of the world, they differ manifeſtly from the world. There is a clear diſtinction to be made between them and other men, by any man that eyes them well, there are none like them in the earth, their wayes are of another faſhion. Now my Beloved, is it ſo with you? do you differ from the world? do you live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godlily in this preſent evil world? In a world of wickedneſs, are you ſingular in goodneſs? ſo that the ſame may be affirmed of you, that is recorded to the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praiſe of righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> that he was juſt and perfect in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. and they were wicked and corrupt enough. Of holy <hi>Lot,</hi> that he was ſo far from joyning with the vitious Sodomites in their vile abominations, that his righteous ſoul was vexed at their filthy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. This is a comfortable evidence that you are given up to Jeſus Chriſt out of this world. But if you walk according to the courſe and cuſtom of the world, as the expreſsion is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. if you have fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, if you run out with others to the ſame exceſs of riot, if you be alſo led away with the error of the world, and ſo fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs, if you be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried down with the ſwinge, and with the current of the times, and of the

places where you live, do not deceive your ſelves, you are yet of this world. I muſt confeſs, it is a very ſtrong temptation, when the ſtream runs in a wrong courſe, and often ſhakes the holieſt Saints. But yet in ſuch a caſe, they that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are of another world, and therefore are not much to eye the faſhion and the wayes of this. They muſt behave themſelves accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the faſhion of their own Country. They muſt conclude with holy <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24.15. If it ſeem evil to other men to ſerve the Lord, if they will forſake God, and forſake his worſhip, let them ſerve whom they will for me; as for my own part, I am at a point for that, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord. And they muſt ſay in ſuch a caſe as <hi>David</hi> did, Away from me ye wicked; I am not for your company, becauſe I am not for your courſes; away from me ye wicked, I will keep the Commandements of my God.</p>

You ſpeake the language of the world and of the Country you belong to. You are full of good diſcourſe, your heart boyles with good matter, as the expreſſion of the Prophet is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.1. It is like a boyling pot, for that is the ſimilitude that is alluded to; it is alwayes bubling up and running over, and then it ſpeaks of good things, as it is added there in that place. The heart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in boyles, and the tongue without ſpeakes; and as the boyling Pot runs over with the ſelf ſame matter which it hath within it, ſo it fares with ſuch an heart. It bubleth up with good matter, the matter which it hath conceived and meditated touching Chriſt, this is that which is ſo readily and freely uttered with the tongue. <hi>My heart is enditing of a good matter; I ſpeak of the things which I have made touching the King.</hi> Such are the hearts and tongues of thoſe that are of the other world; their ſpeech is gracious, and either tends to glorifie their God, or to edifie their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; this is the language of their Country.</p>
                  <p>What think we then of thoſe whoſe language is alwayes vain and frivolous? it doth not benefit the hearers, it miniſtreth no grace, for there is no grace in it; or which is worſe, it is wicked and pernitious. Their ſpeech is rotten and corrupt, there is no ſalt to ſeaſon it and make it wholeſom: and hence their throat is likened to an open Sepulchre, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.13. which breathes and ſteames up nothing elſe but odious ſmells and loathſom exhalations: or elſe at beſt, their ſpeeches and diſcourſes are of nothing elſe but earth and earthly things. Talk with them while you will, you hear of nothing elſe but worldly matters from them. Of what Country do you think are theſe men? The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> tells you, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.5.

They are of <hi>Galilee,</hi> they are of this world, for their ſpeech bewrayeth them.

Shall I ſay that ſuch a man or woman is of heaven, whoſe tongue is ſet on fire of hell? Brethren do not deceive your ſelves, if you cannot ſpake the language, you belong not to that Country.</p>

Other men do thus and thus, and why will not you too? will you be ſingular, and will you go in a way by your ſelves, and will you do as no body doth? Why what though other men do this? whence are thoſe other men? they are not of the world that we are, and therefore they are no examples for us. We muſt not do as they do; no we muſt differ from them, we muſt come out from among them, and be ſeparate, and touch no unclean thing. Though they handle it, we muſt not touch it. When <hi>Shadrach, Meſach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego</hi> refuſed to bow before the Golden Image which <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> the King had ſet up, they might have ſaid to them, What will you do as no body doth? you ſee that all men univerſally fall down before it, and they no ſmall ones neither, the Judges, Councellors, Princes, Rulers of the people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.3. And will you take upon you to be wiſer then your betters? will you ſtand out alone, and be ſo ſtiff in your opinion? yet this did not one whit move them, neither muſt ſuch an argument as this prevail with us. No we muſt keep the right way though we go alone, though all the world ſhould leave us and forſake us. And to this end I propound two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will be a ſafe courſe thus to reſerve our ſelves from the polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, and the contagion of the times and places where we live. The Lord moſt commonly vouchſafes to ſuch a ſpecial priviledge of preſervation, when dangers and calamities and troubles come; as he did to <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and the Mourners in <hi>Ezechiel.</hi> And as they have not ſhared in common corruptions, ſo he exempteth them from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deſolations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as it will be ſafe for us thus to reſerve our ſelves, ſo it will be honourable too. The verieſt wretch may keep himſelf from wicked acts ſometimes, when there are no examples, no temptations to withdraw him. But in a world of wickedneſs to be ſingular in goodneſs, is Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like indeed. It was <hi>Tullies</hi> Commendation of <hi>Muraena, Laudandus Muraena non tam quod in</hi> Aſia <hi>vixerit, quam quod in</hi> Aſia <hi>continenter vixerit.</hi> And Gods of <hi>Job,</hi> that there was none like him in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Are there ſome certain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And are you of that number? there is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>6</label> no reaſon then why you ſhould be ſo much diſtracted and diſquieted to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46169:117"/>
ſee ſuch ſtirs and troubles, ſuch alterations and confuſions in the world. Why ſhould you be ſo out of patience to ſee things turned upſide down in ſuch a Country where you do not live, to which you do not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? What need you care (I ſpake of ſuch a Care as eateth out the joy and comfort of a man) how matters go, what ſtirrs and hubbubs and combuſtions there are here in this world, ſo long as all goes well at home in your world? Remember ſtill in ſuch a caſe that you are not of this world but of another. And why then ſhould it ſtartle you, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the Sea? Yea though the Kingdoms of this world be ſhaken, ſo long as your world and the Kingdom of it is not ſhaken, ſo long as that ſtands firm and ſure, you have no reaſon to be ſwallowed up with overmuch fear, and overmuch ſorrow: But rather on the other ſide, when you ſee all the world and all the Kingdoms of it in a flame, to bleſs and magnifie the Lord that you are out of this world; that you are out of Gun-ſhot, out of the reach of theſe things. Indeed with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the men of this world, who have their Converſation and their portion here, whoſe friends, and means, and dwellings lye in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we have reaſon to be troubled when Concuſſions and Confuſions come upon the earth; for we ſhould pity thoſe who are of the ſelf ſame nature with us, in their troubles and diſtreſſes. But for our ſelves, we may behold the greateſt tribulation and diſtractions that come upon the world, as things that do not much concern us, juſt as we do the wars in <hi>Italy;</hi> when we have peace, we pitty the poor people there, and rejoyce that we live not in that Country. So long as all goes well at home, as no ill tydings come from heaven, from our own Country, we are in a good Condition: It may be we may ſuffer ſome outward evils and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; we may be baniſhed from the Country which we ſojourn in, but then we are but baniſhed from a place of baniſhment. We may be baniſhed (if I may expreſs it ſo) out of this world into the other, that is, we may loſe our lives, but then at worſt we are but baniſhed home. They do but ſend us to the world that we are of, and that we belong to; men may deprive us of the Life by which we live in this world, but this is but a ſeeming Life, the ſhaddow of a Life; it is but as though we lived in the world. But the life by which we live in the world that we are of, is an enduring and abiding life; It is a laſting and an endleſs life, it is above the reach of death and diſſolution: And though the natural life decay, this life of grace will flouriſh and grow ſtronger ſtill, till it be perfected in that of glory.</p>

                  <p>Now to unfold the point a little further to you, becauſe indeed it needs not proof ſo much as explication; We will examine and reſolve a few things.

Thirdly, how far the Father parteth with the right he had in thoſe whom he beſtows upon our Saviour Chriſt? Whether he
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46169:118"/>
makes them over to him ſo, that he himſelf hath now no longer any right at all in them? Or whether only ſo, that Chriſt and he do ſhare toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have a joynt and mixed right and intereſt in thoſe people. And laſtly, ſeeing all do firſt of all belong to God the Father, why he doth not keep them to himſelf, but makes them over to his Son Chriſt. Theſe things would be a little looked into before we come to application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe my Brethren, Who the Father is to whom the people of our Saviour Chriſt do firſt belong? We muſt be ſure that we be right in this, or elſe we miſs in the foundation of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I ſhall be brief upon the reſolution of it now, becauſe you may remember I have done it largely heretofore in another caſe, and on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion. This I deſire you to take notice of, which <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo carefully obſerves, that our Saviour in the Goſpel, eſpecially in this of <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking as man and not as God, under the name of Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates and comprehends the whole Godhead. Nor let this ſeem ſtrange to you; for Chriſt as man is Gods Son, not God the Fathers Son alone, but the Son of the whole God-head. Indeed as God, he is the Son of the firſt perſon only, but as man, he is the Son of all the perſons. As man, he is a Creature, and he is not God the Fathers Creature only, for the works of the Trinity without are individed. And therefore Chriſt is made the Son of God in the ſame way that <hi>Adam</hi> is, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.33. &amp;c. And it is very evident, that in my Text he ſpakes to God the Father, as a Creature and as a Man: for he ſpeakes to him in prayer, and prayer is a part of worſhip, and God doth not worſhip God. And when as man he prayes to God, you muſt not think he prayes to the firſt perſon only and excluſively, but he prayes to all the perſons. And therefore when he ſaith to God in prayer, <hi>thine they were,</hi> the people which I have, were ſometimes thine, he cannot mean that they were the firſt perſons only, (for certainly one perſon prayes not to another) but they were the whole Godheads. You ſee then who the Father is, to whom the people of our Saviour Chriſt do firſt belong. Not God perſonally taken for the firſt perſon of the Godhead, but God eſſentially taken for the whole eſſence of the Godhead, as ſubſiſting in the perſons. And God ſo taken is the Father of our Saviour Chriſt as he is man, and ſo he prayes to him in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So that now the way is open to the ſecond <hi>Quaere,</hi> how and in what reſpect the people of the Lord Chriſt were firſt of all belonging to his Father, that is to the whole Godhead, before they came to his hands as he is man and Mediator of the Church. Beloved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were firſt of all belonging to his Father in that ſenſe that we have ſaid, eſpecially in two reſpects; either as his Created ones; or as his Elected ones, as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or his Choſen.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the people of the Lord Chriſt were firſt of all belonging to his Father as his Creatures. His they were, for he made them. It is the greateſt reaſon in the world, that he that makes a thing ſhould own it too, that it ſhould be his that made it; That he that gives a thing being, ſhould have a title to it while it hath a being, unleſs he voluntarily and freely make it over to another. And by this means, God hath a primitive
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46169:118"/>
original and native right in all the world and all the people that are in it. Jeſus Chriſt as he is man, hath not right to one perſon; I mean origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of himſelf. But how then ſhall he come to have a people to be his members, and to make up a Church a body for him? Why God his Father is content to furniſh him out of his ſtore. Rather then he ſhall want a Company of men to be his members, he will ſpare him ſome of his, and others he will keep for other purpoſes to execute his wrath and manifeſt the glory of his Juſtice on. There are a people for thee, ſaith the Father, thou ſhalt have ſuch and ſuch of mine. All the world are mine, thou knoweſt; and ſuch a number I will give thee out of the world; So ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thou ſhalt have among the Jews, and if that be not ſufficient, thou ſhalt have as many more as thou wilt ask among the Gentiles. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee, Pſal.</hi> 2.7. And hence our Saviour ſpeaking of his people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth they were his Fathers firſt, <hi>I have manifeſted thy name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world. Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. All the people of the Lord Chriſt were firſt of all belonging to his Father as his choſen. Not only as his Creatures, but as his Elect too. And thus he hath a neerer intereſt in thoſe whom he beſtows on Jeſus Chriſt, then he hath in any other. All the world are his indeed, but then there are ſome certain people whom he chooſes for himſelf in a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and a ſpecial way. As he that is the Owner of a goodly Wood, all the Trees are his indeed, but yet there is a Tree or two, or more, which he chooſes to himſelf and which he marks out to himſelf, and for his own particular and private uſe. So the earth is the Lords, and all the people that are in it; but yet there are ſome certain men whom he hath ſet a part from everlaſting to be his, to be the Veſſells of his own Houſe, the Servants of his own Family. As it is ſaid of <hi>Jacob, Pſal.</hi> 135.4. <hi>The Lord hath choſen</hi> Jacob <hi>to himſelf, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>for his peculiar treaſure.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he gives theſe up to Chriſt, and makes them actually his, no marvail though he anſwer him as in my text, <hi>thine they were, and thou haſt given them to me.</hi> And here indeed the gift of God is moſt to be obſerved. He doth not give our Saviour all that are his by Creation, all the wicked; he gives him but ſome of them, and therefore he is ſaid to give them out of the world. But he gives him all that are his by Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he doth not keep one man from him. God hath a ſpecial inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in them above the reſt, they are his own peculiar treaſure, as you heard but now, and every one of them he gives to Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt hath all his treaſure, take his traſh who will.</p>
                  <p>Now for the third particular, how far the Father parteth with the right <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he hath in thoſe whom he beſtows on Jeſus Chriſt. A man would think, by the expreſſion of our Saviour in my text, that he parted with it whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That he makes over all the intereſt he hath, in thoſe whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on Jeſus Chriſt. That when he gives them up to him, he utterly deveſts himſelf of all his former intereſt, ſo that he hath no longer any right at all in them. <hi>Thine they were,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, why then it ſeems they are not now; <hi>thine they were, but now they are no longer thine; for thou haſt given them to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46169:119"/>But certainly we muſt not underſtand it in ſuch an abſolute and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid ſenſe, but with ſome grains of mitigation. For when the Father hath actually given men to Jeſus Chriſt to be his members, they do not ceaſe to be his Creatures, they do not ceaſe to be his choſen, and therefore in a ſence, my brethren, they are his ſtill. And this our Saviour Chriſt acknowledgeth expreſly, but a little after at <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, and mine are thine.</hi> Obſerve it well, he ſaith not to the Father, mine were thine, before thou gaveſt them to me, but mine are thine, notwithſtanding thou haſt given them to me. So that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth ſo beſtow his people on the Son, that after the donation, Chriſt and he do ſhare together, and have a joint and mixed intereſt and right in thoſe people; and however they that appertain to Chriſt, are ſtiled his peculiar people. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. which is a term that intimates not a right in common, but an unmixed and undivided right; you muſt not underſtand it in oppoſition to the Father, but to themſelves, and to the world and to the Devil. They are his peculiar ſo, that though they were once their own, now they are their own no longer. Though they were once the worlds, now they are the worlds no longer. Though they were once the Devils, now they are his no longer. But they are not his peculiar ſo, that they are no more the Fathers. No, God and Chriſt do alwayes ſhare, as I have ſaid, and as he himſelf confeſſeth, in the fore-alledged verſe, <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> And in this ſenſe, you muſt conceive the Expreſſion in my text, <hi>Thine they were.</hi> They were once wholly and entirely thine; now they are not ſo thine, for thou haſt given them to me, and therefore I muſt ſtrike in for a ſhare with thee. Once they were thine only, now it is ſo no longer, for they are thine and mine too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is one thing yet behind; That ſeeing all do firſt belong to God the Father, why he doth not keep them to himſelf, but makes them over to his Son Chriſt. And the reaſon is apparent, becauſe if he ſhould keep them to himſelf (as things are ordered) he muſt loſe them: And therefore gives them up to Chriſt, that he may ſave them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that belong to God, are his created ones, or as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; if he ſhould keep them ſtill in that Condition, and ſhould not give them up to Jeſus Chriſt, there were no other way but they muſt periſh. All that the Creator made, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall have brought themſelves into a loſt condition. His work is wholly ſpoyled and marr'd by ſin that is come in upon it, and hath defaced it, and deſtroyed it ſo that unleſs there be a reparation, all mankind is caſt away and loſt for ever. This reparation is the work of Jeſus Chriſt; it is his buſineſs to repair the ruines of decayed mankind, and to reſtore them to that beauty and felicity from which they are declined and departed by the fall. If God the Father give him any broken piece to be amended and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by him, he doth his work upon him, and he ſaves him to the utmoſt. But if the Father keep him to himſelf as a created one, if he leave him in the condition of a Creature, and do not make him over to his Son, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46169:119"/>
he may be a redeeemed one, that he may be recovered and reſtored by him, he even remaineth in that miſerable and undone eſtate wherein the whole race of mankind is involved by the fall. And therefore when the Father looks on the Creation, and ſees his work is wholly ſpoiled, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders with himſelf, I will not leave it all in this condition; no, ſome of it ſhall be repaired again, and that ſhall be my Sons buſineſs. And ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he picks out ſuch and ſuch a ſoul, and brings it to the Lord Chriſt; There take that ſoul, and ſet it right again: I give it thee to this end that thou maiſt repair it, and reſtore it to all the happineſs which it hath loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> fall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly they that belong to God as his Elected ones, or as his Choſen, if he ſhould keep them ſtill in that Condition, and ſhould not give them up to Jeſus Chriſt (this cannot be, but if this ſhould be ſuppoſed,) there were no other way but they muſt periſh; for it is not enough to the ſalvation of a ſoul, that it be choſen, unleſs withal it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered up to Jeſus Chriſt, and made a real living member of his body. And therefore God Electeth every ſoul in Chriſt; he chooſeth it in him, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. That is, he looks on it in Chriſt, in the inſtant of Election, deſigneth it in time to be a part of Chriſt. And ſo according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the appointed ſeaſon comes, he brings this Choſen one of his to Chriſt, and gives it him, yea puts it into him; There take it to thy ſelf (ſaith he) mine it hath been from everlaſting by election, and now I make it thine by actual union and incorporation. I have done my part for it, and now do thou do thine. I have choſen it, do thou ſave it.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall ſuffice for clearing of the obſervation. I ſhall but add a word or two of application.</p>
                  <p>And is it ſo that all the people of the Lord Chriſt were firſt of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> to the Father? then ſurely he will keep them for the Fathers ſake. Before he let them go, he will conſider with himſelf, of whom he had them. Brethren, you may be confident that Jeſus Chriſt will never loſe his people, but that he will be infinitely chary and extreamly tender of them, becauſe he had them of his Father. How do we eſteem a Ring, a piece of Plate or ſome thing elſe that was our Fathers? If any one deſire it of us, if he offer money for it, no, will ſuch a perſon ſay, I will not take an hundred times the value for it, it was my Fathers and I will not part with it. And do you think my Brethren, that Jeſus Chriſt doth not love his Father, as well as we love ours? And therefore when the Devil or the world, do go about to get away his people from him, when they bid fair for them, when they pluck hard at them; No, ſaith our Saviour, it is in vain; I had theſe people; theſe precious Jewels of my Father, and therefore you may ſpare your labour. His they were, and he gave them to me, and I will ſurely keep them for his ſake that gave them me, yea he gave them to me to this end, that I ſhould keep them. So Chriſt himſelf acknowledges, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. <hi>This is the Fathers will, that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing.</hi> His Father gave them to him, bequeathed them to him, by his will. And this was upon the Will, that he ſhould not loſe them too. O what a ground of confidence is here that Chriſt will keep us? though we be apt to fall away, though the Devil and the world pluck
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46169:120"/>
violently at us, we may depend upon it, they ſhall not get us out of Chriſts hands. We were his Fathers, and he gave us him by Will, and that with this Condition that he ſhould not loſe us. And therefore let us reſt upon it, he will be carefull of his Fathers Will, and he will keep us for his Fathers ſake.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the firſt particular whereof our Saviour minds his Father by way of preparation to the prayer which he makes for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples: that which he had done for them. <hi>I have manifeſted thy name to the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world, thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, that which they themſelves had done in reference to God the Father, <hi>they have kept thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here you may take notice with me of theſe two things, which ſhew themſelves to any one, that doth but look upon the words. Firſt the act of theſe Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour, <hi>they have kept;</hi> And then the object of this act of theirs, the thing which he affirmeth they have kept, the word of God, <hi>They have kept thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this our Saviour mentions (as he doth the reſt) by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to his prayer for them, to ſhew what cauſe there was, why they ſhould be remembred in his prayers, what did induce him to pray and to be confident that he ſhould ſpeed with God in prayer for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had been faithfull and obedient. They had kept the word of God, and therefore they ſhall have his word to God in prayer for them, he makes no doubt, they ſhall have a word from God, by way of mercifull return and gracious anſwer to his prayer.</p>
                  <p>There is the inward and eſſential, and there is the outward and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory word of God. The inward word, the word God. The outward word, the word of God, or the word which comes from God: Though not immediately from God to us, yet mediately by his Prophets and Apoſtles, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf as he was man, whom he made his Scribes, and Heralds, and Embaſſadors and Mouth, <hi>God ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the Prophets, Heb.</hi> 1.1. he ſpake by the mouth of the holy Prophets, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10. <hi>The Prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. And ſo for the New Teſtament, the Apoſtle tell us, <hi>that in theſe laſt dayes God hath ſpoken to us by his Son, Heb.</hi> 1.2. and that which God ſpeaks, is Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Now it is called the word of God in my Text and elſewhere often, becauſe it manifeſteth and makes known the mind and will of God. For as the word of man diſcovers to us, what the man means, what he conceiveth in his mind and heart within, which elſe we were by no means able to imagine; ſo the word of God (my brethren) ſhews us the heart and mind of God, as far as he is pleaſed to expreſs it, and to make it known to us; it ſhewes us what his will and pleaſure is. What he will have us to do, and what he means to do with us.</p>
                  <p>And this word the Apoſtles and Diſciples kept: that is the term our Saviour uſes in my text. He made it known to them, he ſhewed them what his Fathers mind and will was, and they kept it. <hi>I have manifeſted
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46169:120"/>
thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world, and they have kept thy word.</hi> What is intended by that phraſe of keeping, ſhall be fully opened, when I come to explication of the point; in the mean time the obſervation ſhall be this.</p>

                  <p>You ſee it is the Character he gives of thoſe that are beſtowed upon him by his Father. <hi>Thine they were, and thou haſt given them to me, and they have kept thy word.</hi> And after to the ſame effect, they have received thy word; It is uſually ſet down as the property of thoſe who belong to Jeſus Chriſt, that they keep his ſayings, <hi>John</hi> 14.23, <hi>if a man love me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour there, <hi>he will keep my words;</hi> and his words and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers words are all one.

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to ſtay upon the proof in general, becauſe the term is for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dark, I ſhall proceed to ſhew you more particularly and diſtinctly what it is to keep the word of God, which is the main thing in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>They whom the Father gives to Jeſus Chriſt, do keep his word.</hi> Now this imports and carries in it divers things.</p>
                  <p>To keep the word of God is to retain it in the memory, not only to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> receive it, but alſo to retain it there. <hi>To hold faſt what we have received,</hi> as the expeſſion is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Reprobis effluit ſermo dei,</hi> ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi> on my Text. The word of God flows away from reprobates and wicked men. It is like water ſhed upon the ground, which is gone upon the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. But it ſticks with the Elect, it takes deep root there. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the praiſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe kept the ſayings of our Saviour, all his ſayings, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.50. Others loſt them, but ſhe kept them and therefore ſhe is ſet in oppoſition to them. They underſtood not the ſayings which he ſpake to them, they knew not what he meant, and therefore it was quickly gone with them; for what you do not underſtand you ſhall be hardly able to remember. But <hi>Mary kept theſe ſayings in her heart,</hi> while many others, who underſtood not theſe diſcourſes of our Saviour, let them go. They valued them as things of nothing, and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them but as looſe words, and therefore had no mind to keep them. She laid them up with extraordinary care, as ſingular and choice things. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>We ought to give the more earneſt heed to the things which we have heard,</hi> that is to the words of God, <hi>leaſt at any time we ſhould let them ſlip.</hi>

                     </gap>, leaſt we prove like leaking veſſels that hold not what is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into them, but leak it out again upon a ſuddain, Leſt we forget the word of God. That is the firſt thing then, to keep the word of God, is to retain it in the memory. And thoſe whom he beſtows on Chriſt, do thus keep it.</p>
                  <p>And as there is a keeping of it in the memory, ſo in the ſecond place,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> there is a keeping of it in the heart. As in the memory by retaining,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46169:121"/>
ſo in the heart by believing. And of this ſort of keeping ſpeaks our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>John</hi> 8.51. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee death.</hi> His ſaying is the doctrine of the Goſpell which is more properly the word of Chriſt. He cannot mean <hi>if a man keep my ſaying,</hi> if he remember it, <hi>he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> But if a man keep my ſaying, if he believe it, if he keep it in his heart <hi>(for with the heart a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth to ſalvation)</hi> then he ſhall never ſee death. And ſo the words are parallel with thoſe which he delivers in another place, <hi>John</hi> 11.2. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in me ſhall never die.</hi> That is the ſecond ſort of keeping then, in the heart by believing.</p>
                  <p>There is a keeping of the word of God, as in the mind by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and in the heart by believing, ſo in the affections by loving. They are the Cabinet in which it is laid up, and it is very ſafe there. So <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> kept the word of God very dear in his affections, as he profeſſeth very often; ſometimes he ſaith that it is ſweeter to him then hony or the hony-comb ſometimes that is dearer to him then thouſands of Gold and Silver; That he loves it above Gold, yea above fine Gold. He loves it not as Silver, but as Gold, not equall unto Gold, but above Gold. Not above ordinary baſe Gold, but above fine Gold. That place is notable in which he ſeems to be tranſported, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how do I love thy Law!</hi> It is, out of all meaſure, it is ſo great that I am no way able to expreſs it.</p>
                  <p>There is a keeping of the word as in the mind by remembring, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in the heart by believing, and in the affections by loving, ſo in the life by obeying. And in this ſence the phraſe is uſually taken in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; to <hi>keep</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi> is all one. And ſo the Lord himſelf explains it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Ye ſhall walk after the Lord your God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;</hi> And what is that? you ſhall obey his voice and ſerve him, as it is added in the next words.</p>
                  <p>Now the word of God is kept as I ſhall ſhew you very clearly both by active and by paſſive obedience. Firſt it is kept by active obedience to it; and Secondly it is kept by paſſive obedience for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a keeping of the word of God by active obedience to it, by doing that which it commands, and by avoiding that which it forbids. This is the common acceptation of the term. This ſenſe the Holy Ghoſt himſelf (the beſt Interpreter) gives of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.22. <hi>Whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe we keep his Commandments.</hi> Keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments! how ſo? you have it clearly in the following words, <hi>And do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight</hi> And thus you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in the forealledged Scripture. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.28. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it,</hi> that is; that hear it, and obey it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the word of God is kept by obedience active to it, ſo by obedience paſſive for it. And this is clearly intimated in the atteſtation that he gives the Church of <hi>Sardis, Apoc.</hi> 3.10. <hi>thou haſt kept the word of my patience,</hi> that is, as thou haſt kept my word in general, ſo more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thou haſt kept thoſe portions of my word, and thoſe parcels of my truth which muſt have patience to the keeping of them. A man may keep ſome part of Gods word without patience, as being as being univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46169:121"/>
received by all, oppoſed by none. But then there are ſome other portions of the Word and Truth of God, which if a man maintain and hold, and practiſe, he ſhall ſurely ſuffer, he ſhall be perſecuted for them. A man might have gone clear along with ſome truth, even in the <hi>Marian</hi> days themſelves. But if he held and openly profeſſed the truth againſt the real Preſence in the Sacrament, and ſo in many other things, he brought himſelf into extream danger. And ſo in every age there are ſome paſſages of holy Scripture, and the truths delivered in them that are more oppoſed then others, ſo that whoever ſticks to them, ſhall be ſure to meet with trouble, and ſo to exerciſe his patience. And he that keeps theſe notwithſtanding, that maintains them, and that yeilds obedience to them, he keeps the Word of Gods patience. And therefore it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the good ground that it receives the Word of God aright, and brings forth fruit with patience, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. <hi>That on the good ground are they, which in a good and honeſt heart having heard the Word keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience,</hi> That is, the Word is fruitful in them, notwithſtanding perſecutions and afflictions. So was it in the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as the Apoſtle teſtifies of them, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 2.13. <hi>When ye received the Word of God,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the Word of God, which effectually alſo worketh in you.</hi> And what was this effectual operation? Conſtancy in ſharp ſufferings, as you may ſee in the next verſe. And yet they would not let it go, though they ſuffered much for it. That of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> is remarkable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.161. <hi>Princes have perſecuted me without cauſe, but my heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> He had rather have them againſt him, then have the Word of God againſt him. They threatned him if he obeyed and kept the Word. The Word on the other ſide that threatned him if he renounced and diſobeyed it. Whom did he fear moſt? why, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word.</hi> Though they be Princes, very great men, and though they threaten me, and perſecute me too, yet I fear the Word of God more then I fear them. I dare not diſobey it, how much ſoever I diſpleaſe them, how much ſoever I may ſuffer from them. This is to keep the Word by obedience paſſive for it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve for the Explication of the point.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, that they whom the Father gives to Jeſus,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> do keep his Word? Here is a touch-ſtone then, my Brethen, by which you may try your ſelves, whether you be given up to Chriſt, or no. I have ſhewed you heretofore of how great Conſequence it is, for every one of us to be among the number of the men whom God makes over to his Son Chriſt. Indeed ſo great, that all our happineſs both in the preſent life, and that to come, conſiſts in it. If God the Father beſtow us not on Jeſus Chriſt, it had been infinitely better for us that we had never been born, that he had never made us. For we continue in the power and the poſſeſſion of the Prince of this world, his we are, and with him muſt remain for ever. Now my Beloved, would you know whether you be yet made over to the Son of God, or no? Examine diligently whether you have kept the Word of God. <hi>Thine they were,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to God the Father, <hi>and thou gaveſt them to me, and they have kept thy Word.</hi> And

is it ſo with you my Brethren? Conſider it a little and proceed in the diſcovery according to the branches laid before in Explication of the point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Have you kept it in your memories? Abundance of you have read and heard much of the Word of God. Theſe many years it hath been preached to you, you have had precept upon precept, and line upon line, here a little and there a little; you have not been overlaid and dulled ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with long Sermons, but you had a little and a little. A little on a Sabbath day, and a little on a Lecture day. Your leſſons have been ſhort, that you might the better learn them. But what have you retained of all this? Indeed ſome of you have laid up theſe ſayings in your hearts as <hi>Mary</hi> did, you have them ſure and ſafe there. You have them ready and at hand to bring them forth on all occaſions for the Direction and the Conſolation of your ſelves and of your Brethren; But for the greater number, they have loſt all, nothing at all ſticks by them. The Word of God hath come to them as the Apoſtle ſays, and they have let it go again. I muſt acknowledge there is difference in the memories of men, and ſome are ſubject to a natural defect, ſo that they fail them ſtrangely in their own affairs, which are of moſt concernment to them. But when the memories of men are ſure and faithful to them in all other things, but hold the Word of God no better then a Sive holds water, that lets every drop go, this is a very ſad caſe. It is a ſhrewd preſumption that they are none of Chriſts Diſciples. But you will ſay, How ſhall we amend this, how ſhall we do that we may keep the Word of God in this reſpect? I will give you two or three Directions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Keep your minds cloſe to it, let them not rove and wander while you hear it; if they do, you loſe all. This is the Apoſtles counſel to give earneſt heed, to be intent upon the things we hear, to watch the words as they come forth out of the Preachers mouths, <hi>Heb</hi> 2.1. and why ſo? <hi>leaſt at any time we let them ſlip.</hi> If we would remember well, there muſt not be the leaſt diverſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Get a good underſtanding in the Word of God. The obſervation of the Holy Ghoſt is notable for this purpoſe, <hi>Luk</hi> 2.19. They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not the ſayings which he ſpake unto them. <hi>But</hi> Mary <hi>kept all theſe ſayings in her heart.</hi> They kept them not, becauſe they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them; that which is not underſtood will very hardly be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. They are our underſtanding hearers that carry all away, while igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and ſottiſh people keep nothing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Value the Word of God more, and you ſhall find you will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it the better. See the neceſſity, the excellency of it, and then you will be careful how you loſe it. Eſteem it as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> did above gold, yea, above fine gold. He whoſe memory is weakeſt, ſeldom forgets where he hath laid his gold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Strengthen memory by meditation, repetition, conference of what you hear. If it be hard to take in holy Truths, chafe them in, rub them in, and ſettle them by this means. Let them be as a nail well faſtned (as the expreſſion of the Wiſeman is) and ſet home with many ſtrokes that they may not out again.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:46169:122"/>5. Set inſtantly upon the practice of the truth delivered to you; aſſoon as you hear it, act it. That which you do, you will remember. Mark that of the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 1.25. <hi>Not being a forgetful hearer but a doer of the Word;</hi> The doer then is no forgetful hearer. Many men remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becauſe indeed they do nothing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When holy truths are gone with you, when they are ſlipt away, entreat the Holy Spirit to recal them. Mind him humbly of his Office, and of the end for which your Saviour ſent him down into this lower world, to bring things to remembrance which have been taught you, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26.</p>

               <p>TO paſs on to the Second branch of this diſcovery; Have you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> kept the Word of God in your Hearts by believing? This is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree higher, and reaches further then the other. Many keep it in their memories, who do not keep it in their hearts. Many remember it, who do not believe it. And yet unleſs we do both, we can have no aſſurance that we belong to Jeſus Chriſt by the donation of the Father.</p>
               <p>And is it ſo with you my Brethren? Do you believe the Word of God? Do your hearts ſay Amen to every particle and tittle of it? If God ſhould come and put the queſtion to you concerning thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of holy Truths which ſeem moſt hard to be believed, moſt difficult to be accompliſhed, as once our Saviour did to <hi>Martha,</hi> when he had ſaid, <hi>I am the Reſurrection and the life; he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet ſhall he live. And whoſoever liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die. Believeſt thou this?</hi> Joh. 11.26. Can you return the ſame anſwer? yea Lord I believe, as ſhe did; May not the ſame be charged on abundance of you, which God ſo ſharply reprehends in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 106.24. <hi>They believed not his Word, and hearkned not to the voyce of the Lord.</hi> Are there not multitudes among us, who give no credit to the Word at all? who when they hear the truths of God delivered to them, do not enquire with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> only, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> but even peremptorily determine they can never be.</p>
               <p>And here becauſe they are of many ſorts who do not keep the Word of God in their hearts by believing, I will ſet them in their ranks, and proceed with them in order.</p>
               <p>Some there are who queſtion all the Word of God throughout,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from the beginning of it to the end, do not believe one word of it; Either they throw it off, as falſe and vain, without Conſideration, in a raſh and wilde way, or elſe they ſoberly reſolve the Scripture to be nothing elſe but the invention and device of Politick and ſubtile heads, to keep fools in awe withal. And ſo they ſay, upon deliberation, as <hi>David</hi> in his haſte and in his paſſion, <hi>All men are lyars;</hi> the very Pen-men of the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46169:123"/>
Word of Truth it ſelf. The Prophets, the Apoſtles, all are lyars. As that blaſphemous Pope who ſtiled the Goſpel, the Fable of Chriſt. Theſe men are flat Atheiſts, what ever their profeſſions be. We want not ſome in theſe times, who are ſo bold as to declare themſelves in this particular, and openly to renounce the Word of God. And certainly however other men conceal themſelves for ſhame, yet there are more of this opinion then we are aware of. They do not ſay with their tongues perhaps, but yet with <hi>Davids</hi> fool, they ſay it in their hearts, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not Gods Word, yea there is no God at all, to be Author of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others there are who though they do not queſtion all the Scripture, yet they do not believe it all, they give not abſolute belief to every part and parcel of it. And ſince the Word hath in it precepts, promiſes, and threatnings, and there are ſome that queſtion one, and ſome another of them, we will proceed with them diſtinctly, and in order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some there are who do not give aſſent to the Divine Authority of all the Precepts of the Word of God. Some deny ſome certain Precepts' and Commandements by themſelves apart. The Papiſts they deny the ſecond Precept. <hi>Vaſques</hi> acknowledges that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement interdicts not only the adoring of an Image under the notion of a God, but alſo the adoring of the true God in an Image. And further he confeſſes that they do the very thing that is condemned in this Commandement. What then? becauſe it will not be obeyed, it muſt be cancelled and repealed, and not admitted to have any place among the Moral precepts of the Law of God. It was ſaith he, a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Ceremonial Law, and therefore ceaſes now in our days. And thus they make the Commandement of the Lord of no effect, through their tradition. Others deny the fourth Commandement, and affirm that is alſo vaniſhed with the Ceremonials, that it belongeth not to Chriſtians, ſave only in regard of Moral equity, in which reſpect the Moral and Judicial Laws belong to us alſo. And yet the Lord you ſee hath placed it in the middle of the Decalogue, and hedged it in on every ſide with other precepts that it might be the ſafer from the violence of thoſe who ſeek to raze it out of the Tables. But that which theſe men do by parcels and retail, there are another ſort who do in groſs, and as it were by whole ſale, caſt off all the Precepts and Commandements of the Law of God together, affirming they are all aboliſhed, not only in regard of irritation, malediction, condemnation, but even in regard of obligation; And thus with thoſe in <hi>Davids</hi> time they make void the Law of God. Theſe men cannot pray to God as <hi>David</hi> doth, Pſal. 119.66. <hi>Teach me good judgement and knowledge, for I have believed thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</hi> And verily if all that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt do keep the Word of God in the heart by believing, they that renounce it thus, ſeem to be in an ill Condition, and they have reaſon to conſider well whether they be given up to Chriſt or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Others there are who give no credit or belief to the threatnings of the Word, who when they hear them thundered out againſt them, ſay <hi>it is not be,</hi> with Iſrael, <hi>neither ſhall we ſee Sword nor Famine,</hi> Jer, 5.12. And
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46169:123"/>
are there not a multitude of this opinion? For tell me, my Beloved, when you that know your ſelves to be unclean livers; have heard that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful commination, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge:</hi> when you that are ſo glewed to the world, that nothing can divide you from it, have heard that flaming ſentence, <hi>That no covetous perſon hath any inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Kingdom of God:</hi> when you that wallow in your filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you that are lyers, ſwearers, drunkards, enemies of all goodneſs, have heard that <hi>nothing that is filthy or unclean, ſhall come within the new Jeruſalem;</hi> that without ſhall be lyars and dogs that bark and ſnarl, and ſnap at holineſs, that <hi>ſuch ſhall have their portion in the lake,</hi> &amp;c. have you believed theſe threatnings? have you aſſented to the truth of them? Alas, my Brethren, it is Evident you have not. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, If you believe the threatnings, you will quake and tremble at them. This diſpoſition is obſerved in the Saints of God in Scripture, that as they had believing, ſo they had tender trembling hearts, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his threatnings. Such a heart had good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> his heart was tender when he heard the words (that is, the threatning words) of God, his words againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. not to it to inſtruct; nor for it to comfort; but againſt it to affright. Such a heart had holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 119.12. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements.</hi> He ſpeaks not of his Judgements actually inflicted, for they are felt, but of his judgements threatned only; and hanging in the Commination, for they ate feared, <hi>I am afraid of thy judgements.</hi> Of ſuch a temper was the Prophet, Hab. 3.16. <hi>when I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voyce,</hi> &amp;c. And ſuch a diſpoſition they diſcovered, of whom the Propeht <hi>Ezra</hi> ſpeaks, ch. 9. ver. 4. <hi>they feared the words of the God of Iſrael.</hi> That is, his threatning words, as appears by that which follows, <hi>becauſe of their tranſgreſsion.</hi> Nay the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> affirmeth of the very Devils that even they <hi>belive and tremble,</hi> Jam. 2.19. They believe the Comminations, and they quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at them. And verily the ſame effect would they produce in men, if they did but believe them as the Devils do. But alas how many are there who have no ſuch thing in them? who though they hear the wrath of God denounced, and though they ſee his vengeance executed on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men before their eyes in a very dreadful manner, yet are not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or troubled at it in any meaſure or degree, by which it is apparent that they have no faith in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly if you believe the threatnings, you will take ſome courſe or other, to avert the evil threatned. It is obſerved of the <hi>Ninvites;</hi> that they believed God, believed him in the threatning meſſage he ſent them by the Prophet, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5. And what followed? <hi>They proclaimed a Faſt, and put on Sack-cloth, and turned every one from his evil way, from the violence that was in his hands.</hi> They that are never troubled for the ſins which God threatens, never endeavour reformation, but continue as they were, wicked and unclean ſtill, do not believe his Comminations, they look upon them but as <hi>bruta fulmina,</hi> and empty Scare crows which though they may fright others ſo as to drive them out of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſins, they are reſolved they ſhall never ſcare them, ſo as to work
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46169:124"/>
the ſmalleſt change, or the leaſt amendment in them.</p>
               <p>There are a third ſort yet behind, and they are ſuch as do not believe the promiſes of God. They do not act their faith upon them; They do not keep them in their hearts by beleiving. And truly there are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes that fail in this particular, as is apparent by theſe ſymptomes following, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are ſo full of fears, they walk ſo ſadly and dijectedly. Faith in the promiſes will fill the heart with joy and comfort in the worſt of times, and the ſharpeſt of ſufferings. <hi>Believing we rejoyce</hi> with the Apoſtle, and that <hi>with joy unſpeakable and glorious,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. You cannot think of any trial, any trouble, whether inward in the ſoul, or outward in the body, name, eſtate, but there is a promiſe for it, to clear and comfort and ſupport the ſoul in it. And if the promiſe be believed, the ſoul cannot be void of comfort; It will revive the ſaddeſt heart. It is for want of faith that men are ſo oppreſſed with grief and ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is too evident that men do not believe the promiſes of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo full of doubts and fears, ſo full of endleſs cares and troubles, and diſtractions. Brethren, there is no end of the cares and fears of men, of their queſtions and debates untill they come to pitch upon the promiſes. Till they come to reſt on this, God hath ſaid it, I have God in bond for it, he hath undertaken it who lives for ever, in whom is everlaſting ſtrength; the ſoul will never be at quiet, it will be ſhaken as the trees in the Forreſt, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.2. Oh thinks a poor wretch, if I ſhould live till I be blind, till I be impotent, till I have ſpent all, what ſhould I do? What ſhall my wife and children do? What if I loſe ſuch a friend, or ſuch a comfort? So rich men have as much trouble, What if the times ſhould frown upon me? what if malicious men ſhould ſwear againſt me? what if the Enemy break in upon me and plunder me? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a thouſand of theſe doubts and fears men have; And whence are all theſe? truly they are not ſo much from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their danger, as from the ſmallneſs of their faith: <hi>O you of little faith, wherefore do you doubt?</hi> whence are your doubtings, troubles and perplexities, but becauſe you do not keep the word of promiſe in your hearts by believing? You do not act your faith upon that Word of God, that he <hi>will never fail you nor forſake you.</hi> Beloved, let a man look where he will, there is a greater power againſt him, then there can be for him, out of God. And all theſe outward things are ſo contingent, they lie ſo doubtful and uncertain, that a man can never be ſecure in them. And therefore if you would be ſetled and ſecured for the future, build on God, and on the Promiſe. Say not I have ſuch a Parent, ſuch a Friend, and he will provide for me, he will ſee I ſhall not want. I have ſuch Income by the year, ſuch a Trade, ſuch an Eſtate, ſuch a power on my ſide. The concluſion will not hold; but ſay rather I have ſuch a God, and ſuch a promiſe. God hath ſaid that he will feed me, and therefore I ſhall be fed. God hath ſaid that he will keep me, and therefore I ſhall be kept. God hath ſaid that he will pardon me, and therefore I ſhall be forgiven.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:46169:124"/>3. It is apparent that men do not believe the promiſe, becauſe they are inconſtant and uncertain in their ways. They knew not what to do, nor where to live, nor what ſide to ſtick to. They are toſſed to and fro, they are on and off again. And what is the cauſe of this? truly it is for want of faith upon the promiſe; for that would ſettle them and root them; but on the other ſide, ſaith God, and bindes it with a ſtrong aſſeveration too, <hi>If ye will not believe, ſurely ye ſhall not be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Iſa. 7.9. You will be thus unſtable ſtill, and fickle ſtill, unleſs you pitch by faith upon the promiſe.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is apparent that men do not believe the promiſe, becauſe they will ſuffer nothing for it. They will not part with any thing, their liberty, their eaſe, their profit for the promiſe ſake: whereas faith if it were acted, would have an admirable operation on them. And therefore the Apoſtle makes this the ground of the ſtrange patience of the Saints. When they were tortured, tryed with mockeries, ſcornings, bonds, impriſonment, when they were ſtoned, ſawn aſunder, what made them able to endure ſuch things, and not to accept deliverance when it was offered, if they would have yeelded and complyed a little? It was their faith, as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33, 37. by faith upon the promiſe they attained to this ſtrength, that they could not be overcome nor made to yeeld to adverſaries when they endured ſuch torments as were impoſſible for fleſh and blood to ſuffer, but became Conquerors in them all, <hi>yea more then Conquerors,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. So when it is affirmed of the holy Martyrs, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.11. that they overcame the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon in all the perſecutions that he raiſed againſt them, it is withall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that they did it by the blood of the Lamb; the faith they had in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt enabled them to bear and overcome ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter torments as they did endure. And ſo it will do any of us in the like caſe. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. And therefore when we are ſo quickly overcome, and brought to chooſe ſin rather then affliction, it is a ſign we want faith.</p>
               <p>By this, you ſee there are too many who do not keep the Word of God in their hearts by believing. Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, as you would have this aſſurance that you are of the number of thoſe that belong to Chriſt by the donation of the Father, keep his words; if you obſerve your Faith to waver, or to fail in any point, abaſe and judge your ſelves for it. And that you may the better know how far to judge, and how far to acquit your ſelves in this particular, I ſhall give you ſome Cautions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You are not bound to credit every thing that is preſented to you, under the name and title of the Word of God; To give a ſuddain and inconſiderate aſſent to all that the beſt Miniſter delivers to you, becauſe he teaches it, and you are well perſwaded of the man. You may, nay more then ſo, you ought to try before you truſt in this caſe. <hi>Prove every thing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Theſ. 5.21. <hi>and then hold faſt that which is good.</hi> It is obſerved of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> that they were not ſo ſervilly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and engaged to any Teachers, how excellent ſoever their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments were, as to receive upon their credit any thing that they
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:46169:125"/>
delivered. No, their manner was to ſearch the Scriptures, whether things were ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. And yet it is notable that they are ſaid to have received the Word of God with all readineſs of mind for all this. The Lord requires no greater readineſs of mind then this, in entertaining or believing any thing that is delivered in his Name, that is, to take it upon ſome trial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is no ſign of infidelity to move ſome queſtions, with an aym at ſatisfaction concerning things delivered either in or from the Word. If it be done with holy reverence, and with an humble and ſincere deſire of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and inſtruction, it is a very good courſe. So did the bleſſed Virgin make a queſtion concerning what the Angel had delivered to her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.34. A queſtion not of oppoſition, but of inquiſition, <hi>How ſhall theſe things be?</hi> This way of making doubts and queſtions it ſeems was uſed in the Jewiſh Church, and Chriſt approved it by his Example, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.46, 47. So it is ſaid of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> that <hi>he reaſoned with the Jews out of the Scriptures,</hi> Act. 17.2. And if ſuch reaſonings were more in uſe, not reaſonings againſt the Word, but out of the Word, there would aſſuredly be more faith then there is at this day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay (though it be a ſign of weakneſs,) it is no ſign of utter infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, to have ſome doubtful thoughts ariſing in our hearts concerning the moſt clear and pregnant Truths that are revealed in the Word of God. <hi>David</hi> had ſuch thoughts as theſe, and yet he was a good man, though this indeed were no part of his goodneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, 37, 38. There you have firſt the Lords aſſurance, that he will eſtabliſh <hi>David</hi> and protect him. And at laſt he comes to ſwear that he will not lye to <hi>David, his Throne ſhall endure for ever,</hi> &amp;c. And yet obſerve how <hi>David</hi> faileth in the very next words, <hi>but thou haſt caſt off and abhorred, thou haſt made void the Covenant of thy ſervant.</hi> This was his great infirmity, and yet you ſee it was not incompatible with grace. It may befall a Saint, to have ſuch unbelieving thoughts as theſe, provided that he pray againſt them, ſtrive againſt them, and be humbled for them. As <hi>David</hi> was when he had motions to diſtruſt the Providence of God, to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion this great truth of God, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. this did ſo trouble him, that at verſ. 21. he ſaith his very heart was grieved, and he was pricked in his reins becauſe he was ſo fooliſh and ſo ignorant: And while it is thus with us, we need not thereupon, to doubt our intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But if we entertain ſuch thoughts as theſe, and bid them welcome when they come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we never pray, nor ſtrive againſt our unbelief, nor grow up into any certainty in matters of Religion: If we reſolvedly reject the Word of God, either in part, or in the whole, this is a very ſad caſe. <hi>If I ſpeak the truth</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>why do you not believe me?</hi> Joh. 8.46. And mark what follows preſently, <hi>ye therefore hear me not,</hi> that is, believe me not, <hi>becauſe ye are not of my ſheep, as I ſaid unto you.</hi> So that it is a formidable thing you ſee not to believe the Word of Chriſt. It ſhews that men are none of Chriſts. And therefore let us give aſſent to the whole Word of God, the precepts, promiſes, and threatnings, that Chriſt may own us, that he may ſay concerning us
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46169:125"/>
to God the Father, <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have diſpatched the firſt and ſecond branch of the diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to the third; Have you kept the Word of God in your <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> affections by loving it? it is ſomewhat to remember it, it is more to give aſſent and credit to it, but it is moſt of all to love and delight in it. And yet unleſs you reach to this you can have no aſſurance that you belong to Jeſus Chriſt, and that you are beſtowed upon him by the Father. The very Devils know the Word of God, and think upon it, and believe it too; they are convinced of the truth of it, and yet they are ſo far from loving it or taking any pleaſure in it, that they tremble at it. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is againſt them, they look upon it as an Enemy that ſpeaks ſad things to them, and ſo they are afraid of it. They fear it with a ſlaviſh fear, and ſlaviſh fear caſteth out love. To ſay the truth, the more they credit it, the leſs they love it, and the more they tremble at it. And ſo it is in ſome degree with wicked and ungodly men. They give aſſent to the letter of the Scripture, they believe it to be true, but they have no affection to it; becauſe it is no friend to them and their courſes. It croſſes them in every thing they have a mind to, and therefore they are at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with it, and their hearts riſe up againſt it; they receive the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and in ſome ſort the belief, but they do not receive the love of the Truth. But you my Brethren, muſt go further yet if you will clear your intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; you muſt go beyond Devils, yea you muſt go beyond the beſt of carnal and unſanctified men, you muſt not ſatisfie your ſelves with this, that you know the Word of God, that you have it in your mindes, that you are able to diſcourſe of it; that you believe it to be true in all particulars. But more then ſo, your hearts muſt be carryed out in dear affection to it. If this be wanting, all the reſt is worth nothing: You may periſh notwithſtanding as peſons that are out of Chriſt, and be damned in hell for ever, unleſs you come to love the Word of God, as you may ſee in that remarkable Example, 2 Theſ. 2.10. <hi>They received not the love of the Truth</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, and what follows? <hi>that they might be ſaved.</hi> No ſalvation unleſs the Word, the Truth of God be kept in the affections by the loving it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is added preſently, <hi>for this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they might all be damned.</hi> Oh then as you deſire to have this ſweet aſſurance in your ſouls, that you belong to Jeſus Chriſt, and that you ſhall be ſaved by him, examine whether you have kept the Word of God in this reſpect or no? whether you have it dear in your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
               <p>And that you may the better try your ſelves in this regard, I ſhall give you ſome diſcoveries.</p>
               <p>If you love the Word of God, you will deſire on all occaſions to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with it. Deſire of union and communion is alwaies an effect and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> evidence of true affection. You ſhall obſerve it in the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> who was unparalleled in this reſpect, for infinite affection to the Word of God. It is a wonder to conſider how his heart was ſet upon it. And hence it was, that when he was kept off from the enjoyment of the Word,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46169:126"/>
he had ſuch vehement and enflamed deſires to be partaker of it. He panted and he gaſped after it, <hi>even as the Hart panteth after the water-brooks. Oh when ſhall I appear before God?</hi> Pſal. 42.2. when ſhall I be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his Word, and of his Ordinances once again? when will it once be? So in another place, <hi>My ſoul longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord,</hi> where Ordinances were diſpenſed. <hi>My heart and my fleſh cryes out for the living God,</hi> Pſal. 84.2. So that he envies the very Sparrows and the Swallows, who were freer then himſelf to be near that place. Yea, his longing was ſo great, that he was even heart-broken with it, Pſal. 119.20. <hi>My ſoul breaketh for the longing that it hath to thy judgements at all times.</hi> And have you ſuch affections, and ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helations in you? Let us examine it a little in theſe two particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Do you hear the Word of God as often as you may? not only now and then, when you have nothing elſe to do, and when you have no other buſineſs to withdraw you, but conſtantly on all occaſions? do you attend upon it, as your main and chief buſineſs? do you for the love you bear it, neglect and ſet aſide and under-value other things? this is the Wiſemans admonition, Prov. 23.23. <hi>Buy the Truth and ſell it not.</hi> Sell it not for a little profit, in the field or in the ſhop, but rather buy it and redeem it with your loſs of outward things. Do you conceive that <hi>David</hi> of whoſe high affections you have heard, would neglect any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, for being made partaker of the Word of God? Oh how did he bewail the want of it? How would he have ſtruggled for it? How eagerly would he have taken it, with any outward diſadvantage? And this is that which Chriſt commendeth <hi>Mary</hi> for, not for a work of ſuperero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as doing more then ſhe was bound to do, but for a regular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and eſtimation of the Word, ſetting aſide her houſhold buſineſs, that ſhe might be partaker of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.42. Not only they that will not hear the Word of God at all, but they that hear it ſeldom, that ſuffer every worldly buſineſs to withdraw them from it, will be found not to have loved it and eſteemed it as they ought to do. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb. 2.3. <hi>if we neglect ſo geeat ſalvation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Do you exerciſe your ſelves as in the hearing, ſo in the reading and in the meditation of it? Do you converſe with the Word of God in private? Doth it dwell with you in your houſes, as the Apoſtles phraſe is? <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. For this you muſt know, my Brethren, that though you ſhould be ordinary hearers of the beſt Miniſtry beneath Heaven, yet you muſt not reſt in that, but you muſt exerciſe your ſelves in reading of the Word of God in private. It was the Lords Commandement to the King himſelf, that though he might plead want of leiſure more then many others, and though he had the ordinary help of the Levites, Prieſts, and Prophets more then others, as <hi>David</hi> had both <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> yet he muſt have his Bible ſtill, and muſt be conſtant in the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 47.49. And it was that which cheered and ſupported <hi>Job</hi> in his affliction, <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. that he could ſay uprightly in the preſence of the Lord, <hi>I have eſteemed the Word of his mouth more then my neceſſary and appointed food.</hi> More duly then he kept his meals, he tyed himſelf to read and meditate in Gods-Word. Among the Jews
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46169:126"/>
under <hi>Antiochus</hi> it was made capital for any man to have the Book of God by him. And in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> days, you know the danger was not leſs, and then how did they prize a little piece of Holy Writ, how did they value a few Chapters of the Bible? If a poor a man could get a leaf, or two, how ſafely would he keep them in his boſom, next his heart, as the moſt pretious things he had? How would he wear them out with reading in them? God hath dealt more gratiouſly with us, there is now no danger to have a Bible, and therefore if we be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the reading and the meditation of it, we ſhew not ſuch affection to it as we ought to do. That is the firſt thing then; if you love the Word of God, you will deſire on all occaſions to converſe with it, both in publique and in private.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you love the Word of God, you will endeavour to be inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it; we converſe with many men, with whom we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate. And ſo there are abundance that hear and read the Word of God, and yet know little of the meaning of it. But if you love it as you ought to do, you will not ſatisfie your ſelves with this, that you read ſo many Chapters in a day, that you attend on every Sermon that is preached, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you find that you do in a meaſure underſtand the mind of God, and the mind of Jeſus Chriſt, in thoſe things. If I affect a man exceedingly, I ſhall endeavour what I can to get within him, as we uſe to ſay; not to know his face, and to hear his words only, but to be inwardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his diſpoſition, and the purpoſe of his heart. And ſo if you affect the Word, you will ſtrive to get into the boſom of it; You will not be contented with a formal ſuperficial knowledge of the letter of it, but you will dive into the very bowels of the Scripture, and never leave till you know the heart of it. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, Col. 3.16. <hi>Let the Word of God dwell in you richly,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Let it dwell, let it be a houſhold-gueſt, let it riſe, and ſit and walk, dine and ſup, and lodge with you, let it be familiar to you. Be you as throughly acquainted with it, as any man that dwells in your houſe, with whom you have diſcourſe and dealing every hour. And truly if you ſtrive not thus to be acquainted with the Word of God, you do not love it as you ought to do.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If you love the VVord of God, you will not eaſily fall out with it, when you find the meaning of it, and perceive it is againſt you in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is naturally dear to you, you will not quarrel with it, your hearts will not riſe up in enmity againſt it. No, your dear affections to it will make you quietly and meekly to ſubmit to it. Indeed ungodly men cannot endure the VVord of God; the Precepts and Commandements of it are like bonds and cords to them, they lay reſtraint upon them, they curb them and they hold them in, and hence they are enraged againſt it. They endeavour what they can to break the bonds of God aſunder, they are always contradicting and oppoſing, and gainſaying, and raiſing quarrels, and diſputes againſt the Word, becauſe they hate it. But now the Saints upon the other ſide are very much in Love with it, and hence it is that the Commandements of it are not grievous to them, they agree with their ſpirits, they are written in their hearts. Or if at any time
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46169:127"/>
it croſs them, they are not angry with the Word, but with themſelves, that their baſe hearts ſhould not in every thing agree with it; Yea, when it is a little ſharp and bitter, though their ſtomachs riſe at firſt, yet in the iſſue they ſubmit, and ſay as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 39.8. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord, which thou haſt ſpoken.</hi> They find a ſweet and pleaſing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour even in the ſowreſt paſſage of the Word. There goes a ſavour with their knowledge of it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Carnal men may know abundance of the Scripture, more then a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Saint of God; but here is the difference, they find no ſavour in their knowledg of it, at leaſt no ſweet and pleaſing ſavour. No, it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſtful to them, it doth not ſuit with their palates, it doth not fit their humors. A Drunkard knows it is a ſin to be intemperate, to drink himſelf down to a beaſt; A wanton and laſcivious perſon knows it is a ſin to be unclean, but this doctrine doth not pleaſe him; and ſo it is in other caſes: whereas the Truth is ſweet to thoſe that are in Chriſt, they look upon it as their friend, and love it, becauſe it joyns with them againſt their luſts who are their greateſt enemies, whom they abhorre and whom they hate with a perfect hatred.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If you love the VVord of God, you will hardly part with it; you will not let it go from you, if you can keep it any way, by any means. And much leſs will you go from it. <hi>I have not departed from thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David</hi> to the Lord, Pſal. 119.102. <hi>for thou haſt taught me.</hi> Brethren, there are a ſort of men who have a kind of knowledge of the Word of God, but they have no love to it, and hence it is that they are eaſily withdrawn from it, as multitudes have been in theſe times; while they that have it dear in their affections are rooted and eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth, as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. They are not carryed clean away with every new opinion and conceit as others are. They cleave unto the Truths of God, with full purpoſe of heart. They are ſetled in their judgements, and reſolved in their minds, This is undoubtedly the Truth of God, I know it to be ſo, I find it to be ſo by ſenſible experience in my ſoul, and to this I mean to ſtick, even to the loſs of goods and life, and all. I am reſolved that I will not relinquiſh it, what ever hazard I may undergo to hold it, whatever Sophiſters and ſlie Seducers object againſt it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If you love the Word of God, you will be extreamly troubled when it is ſlighted and abuſed; it will vex you to the heart, to ſee it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued and deſpiſed; You will be ready to reply in ſuch a caſe, The VVord is a good friend of mine, one whom I love dearly, from whom I have received much comfort: And I am no way able to endure, it wounds me to the very ſoul to ſee it uſed in this faſhion. Beloved, theſe are times in which the VVord of God hath ſuffered much from wicked and ungodly men. It hath been ſtrangely ſcorned and contemned, and even trampled under foot: It hath been uſual in theſe days of ours for men to ſpeak againſt thoſe things that are delivered from the VVord, contradicting and blaſpheming. Now, my Beloved, how have ſuch things as theſe affected you, and wrought upon you? what tears have they drawn from you? what ſorrow have they wrought in you?
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46169:127"/>
how often have they ſent you over-loaden to your cloſets, there to open all to God? It is obſerved by the Holy Ghoſt, that when <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> had cut the roll in pieces with a pen-knife which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> brought him from the Lord, and burnt it in the fire upon the hearth, they that ſtood by were not afraid, neither did they rent their garments, nor manifeſt their ſorrrow, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.23, 24. Beloved, ſome of you have ſeen as high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as this offered to the word of God, though not in the ſame kind. And truly if you have not rent your hearts, at leaſt, if you have not been inwardly afflicted in your ſpirits, and done what you are able to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it, you have ſhewed but little love to Gods word.</p>
               <p>By theſe things you may try whether you have kept the word of God in your affections by loving it, and ſo have made it to appear that you belong to Jeſus Chriſt, by the donation of the Father.</p>
               <p>Now in the laſt place, let me quicken you a little to the love of Gods word; That if you love it not already, you may come to love it; Or if you love it, you may go on to love it yet more. And to this end I ſhall deſire you to take notice of how great excellency and admirable uſe it is to you, as I ſhall lay it open in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Are you yet in your natural eſtate? the word of God is the means to convert you. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. Sanctifie them</hi> ſaith our Saviour; How? <hi>By thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> Joh. 17.17. That ſpeech of <hi>Paul</hi> is appoſite and full, <hi>God hath choſen you to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through ſanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, whereto,</hi> that is, to which ſanctification and belief <hi>he hath called you by our Goſpel,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Are you wandering from the way? as who hath not his deviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? The word of God is a light to guide you; it is a Lanthorn to your feet, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Thou ſhalt guide me with thy Counſel,</hi> Pſal. 73.14. <hi>q. d.</hi> although thou do not lead me by the pillar of a cloud and fire, as once thou didſt thy people in the Deſert, although thou goeſt not with me in a viſible appearance, yet thou haſt left me ſuch exact directions, ſuch wholeſome Counſel in thy word, that if I follow that exactly, it is impoſſible I ſhould miſcarry.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Are you ignorant? the word of God is a teacher to inform you, <hi>It giveth underſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 119.130. <hi>And makes them wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. There is no knowledge indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly required to ſalvation, nothing of neceſſary faith or practice, either to be believed or done, but is abundantly revealed in the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Are you infirm and weak in grace? The word of God is a means to confirm you. This was the Inſtrument by which the Apoſtles confirmed the Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.4. And as it is the uſual means, by which the grace of God is begotten in the heart, in which reſpect we find it ſtiled <hi>The word of grace,</hi> becauſe it works it, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.32. ſo it is the inſtrument by which it is confirmed and encreaſed. We grow by ſucking the ſincere milk of the word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. And we are built up by it to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:46169:128"/>5. Are you in any deep diſtreſs? The word of God is the means to comfort you. <hi>Through-comfort of the Scriptures we have hope,</hi> Rom. 15.4. And <hi>David</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delight, I ſhould then have periſhed in my affliction,</hi> Pſal. 119.92. And in another place cries out, <hi>Remember thy word unto thy ſervant upon which thou haſt cauſed me to hope; this is my comfort in my affliction, for thy Word hath quickned me,</hi> Pſal. 119.49, 50.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Are you loſt, as we are all of us by nature? The word of God is the means to ſave you: this is the ſaving doctrine, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.14. The word of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. the word that brings men to life and glory. <hi>The Gentiles</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> Epheſ. 3.6. <hi>came to be fellow-heirs, and partakers of the promiſe by the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To ſum up all, we have cauſe to love the word, to have it dear in our affections, for it is the word that guides us, it is the word that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, it is the word that confirms us, it is the word that comforts us, it is the word that ſaves us, that <hi>is the power of God unto ſalvation;</hi> with which agrees the Apoſtles valediction to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Act:</hi> 20.32. wherewith I take my leave of you at this time; <hi>I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</hi>

               <p>WE have been long upon this uſe of trial and diſcovery whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be given up to Chriſt, or no, by the donation of the Father. Three branches of it we have now diſpatcht, and are arrived at the fourth and laſt, which God aſſiſting we ſhall finiſh at this time. Have we kept the word of God, as in our minds by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, and in our hearts by believing, and in our affections by loving, ſo in our lives by obeying? For all of theſe as you have heard, are comprehended under this expreſſion. And this indeed, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as it is the laſt, ſo it is the heigth, the upſhot, and the ſum of all, to keep the word of God in the life by obeying.</p>
               <p>Many there are that remember much of it, that give aſſent and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it, yea, that pretend a great deal of affection to the word of God, and are indeed much taken with many things that are delivered in it, and yet they fail in this which is the main buſineſs, they do not give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to the practice and obedience of it. They leave the rule of God, and are a way and rule unto themſelves. And this was <hi>Herods</hi> temper right, <hi>he heard the word of God gladly,</hi> he took ſome kind of pleaſure in it, and therefore out of doubt had ſome affection to it; but when it came to practice and obedience, there he failed. He did but many things at moſt, he did not all that was delivered to him from the word of God, and this was that which marred all, and made all the reſt worth nothing. And ſo the ſecond ground, the ſtony places in the parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:46169:128"/>
they received the Word of God and that <hi>with joy,</hi> and there muſt be ſome love where there is delight and joy; and yet no fruit at all follows, as you may ſee in that place: And truly there are many ſuch among us, who find ſome taſte in <hi>the good Word of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5. There is a pleaſing reliſh in it which they are delighted with, as there is ſomething in the Word that may content a palate that is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnal, but they make it not their rule in their lives and converſation. They ſit before the Preacher as the people ſits, and liſten with affection to his words perhaps, they are a pleaſant ſound to them, but their hearts are far from ſtooping to the obedience of the Word; no, they are for their covetouſneſs, their uncleanneſs and their luſts ſtill.</p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you, my Beloved, ſee how it is with you in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: If you will have this ſweet aſſurance in your ſelves that you are given up to Jeſus Chriſt, by the donation of the Father, you muſt keep the Word of God in your lives by obeying it: you muſt not reſt in this, that you have (as you conceive) ſome love to it, and that you take ſome kind of pleaſure and delight in it, (for this a carnal wretch, a reprobate may do) but you muſt yeild obedience to it; you muſt be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ordered by it in your ways: the Word of God muſt be a guide to you. When you have any thing to do, you muſt not think what is agreeable to your wills, humors, intereſts, ends, and ſo act accordingly. But you muſt ſeriouſly conſider with your ſelves what is agreeable to the direction of the Word of God, and to the rule which he hath there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to you, and to that you muſt conform, how unſutable ſoever it may be to your deſires or to your aims. Thus you muſt keep the Word of God, (if you will clear your intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, in your lives by obeying it.</p>
               <p>And here that you may not be miſtaken, and deceive your ſelves, I ſhall deſire you to take notice of a few things.</p>
               <p>You muſt keep it wholly and entirely, you muſt not keep ſome parts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and parcels of the Word of God, and leave the reſt out of your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and obedience. No, you muſt keep it all throughout without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or limitation, if you will make it to appear that you belong to Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Thou haſt given them to me</hi> (ſaith our Saviour in my Text) <hi>and they have kept thy Word.</hi> Obſerve it well; he ſaith not, They have kept ſome portion of thy Word, or They have kept it in ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things, they have obeyed ſome rules and ſome directions of it, but <hi>they have kept thy Word,</hi> you muſt conceive it, all thy Word, without any reſervation. They have not willingly allowed themſelves in any diſobedience to the leaſt iota of it. And thus it is with thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, they are obedient to the Word in all things, and ſo they make it to appear that they are men of proof indeed, that they are tried Chriſtians, as the Apoſtle ſhews, 2 Cor. 2.9. <hi>To this end did I write to you, that I might have the proof of you, and whether you would be obedient in all things.</hi> They can ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth, Pſal. 119.104. <hi>Through thy precepts I get underſtanding, therefore every falſe way I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abhorre.</hi> Aſſoon as I get ſo much underſtanding from thy Word and from thy Law, to know that ſuch a way is falſe, and leads not to
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46169:129"/>
the happineſs and comfort which it ſeems to promiſe. I do not follow it and keep it as I did before; no I decline it and abhorre it, yea, I abhorre it utterly, I never touch more with it, let it be what it will, never ſo ſweet, ſo pleaſing, ſo delightful, ſo accuſtomed to me. <hi>Through thy Law I get underſtanding, therefore every falſe way I utterly abhorre.</hi>

               <p>And is it ſo with you (my Brethren)? Turn in upon your ſelves a little, and conſider how farre you are acquainted with the Word and Will of God, how far the Lord hath ſhewed what is good, and what he requires of you, ſo that you are convinced of it; and then examine whether you fall ſhort in nothing, whether you come fully up to the obedience and the practice of it: whether you keep the Word entirely, ſo that you do not fail in any thing adviſedly and cuſtomarily, of which your underſtandings are informed, and which you know to be a duty. Tell me Beloved, is there no ſuch thing? is the Conſcience quiet now? doth it lay nothing to your charge? no neglect of any thing you ſhould have done? doth it not tell you that in this and that particular you know the rule, and yet you have not walked accordingly? In ſuch or ſuch a thing you have gone quite and clean againſt it. Brethren, if your hearts accuſe you, God is greater then your hearts, and knoweth all things. Go home and judge your ſelves for it: Commune with your hearts and ſay, Herein I ſee I have been faulty; I have not kept the Word of God, my practice hath not been in every point according to the Rule; no, I have failed in this and that and the other thing: But now I am reſolved in good earneſt, by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt to take another courſe as far as it is poſſible; I will not ſwerve a whit, nor vary in my converſation from the Word of God. This I acknowledge I have done, which I know well enough I ought not to have done. This, I confeſs, I have neglected, which I know I ſhould have done, but now it ſhall be ſo no more. My aim ſhall be to keep the Word, as far as humane weakneſs and infirmity will ſuffer, wholly and entirely. Thus you muſt do if you will make it to appear, that Chriſt hath any ſhare in you.</p>
               <p>As you muſt keep the Word wholly, ſo you muſt keep it cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> too. As you muſt obey it all, ſo you muſt obey it all with all the heart: Your obedience to the Word muſt flow from principles of heartineſs and love with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, and not from baſe reſpects and ends without. And this is that which the Apoſtle teſtifies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> Rom. 6.17. <hi>Ye have obeyed from the heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the form of Doctrine that hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to you,</hi> or <hi>whereto you were delivered,</hi> as it is rendred in the margent; <hi>you have obeyed it,</hi> and <hi>you have obeyed it from the heart;</hi> ſo that your obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was voluntary, free, delightful; you found complacencie and pleaſure in it; you needed nothing elſe to carry and incline you to it, but the inward motion, diſpoſition, and affection of the heart: You had enough within you, to quicken you, and ſtir you up to the obedience of the Word of God. And thus it is with thoſe that are beſtowed on Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; they obey it heartily, while others do it meerly out of ſelf-ends: All their motives and inducements to the obedience which they yeild are from without; either they are drawn by force, or they are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:46169:129"/>
hired, or they are frighted to it. Their hearts meerly of themſelves do nothing with them in the buſineſs. <hi>Jehu</hi> was large enough in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the command and will of God, as to the matter of the things he did with reference to <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe. To ſay the truth, he did all, every thing that God would have him; But he failed in this particular, he did nothing heartily, nothing out of love to God, but all for his own ends, and therefore all he did was worth nothing. See what an ample atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he received from God himſelf, 2 King. 10.13. <hi>Thou haſt executed that which was right in my eyes, and haſt done to the houſe of</hi> Ahab <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all that was in my heart.</hi> He had not omitted any particular, and yet becauſe it was not cordially done for God, but meerly for himſelf, that he might bring about his own deſigns, he met with a revenge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a reward, as you may ſee <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.4. How far doth <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> go? Ezra 7.23. <hi>Whatſoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently done.</hi> You ſee to what a paſs this Heathen Prince is brought, he will do any thing for God; any thing that he requires, let it be what it will, he will obey. But what is that which moves him to it? is it a principle of love to God, doth he do it heartily? No, it proceeds from noting elſe but fear of wrath and vengeance, as it is apparent in the latter member of the verſe, <hi>for why ſhould there be wrath upon the Realm of the King, and of his Sons?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I beſeech you, try your ſelves in this particular; you obey the Word of God, yea, and it may be you are large in your obedience, as to the matter of the thing required. But do you (as it is obſerved of the <hi>Romans</hi>) obey it from the heart, or from ſome other principle? if there is nothing elſe to move you, would your hearts carry you to this obedience? Have you that within you ſtill, that would hold you in from ſin and ſtir you up to duty, if there were no inducement from without? Can you ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth? Pſal. 10 8. <hi>Lord, I delight to do thy will, for thy Law is in my heart.</hi> Lord, we delight to pray, read, hear, perform religious duties; it is our meat and drink to do thy will, <hi>for thy Law is in our hearts;</hi> It is not written in our underſtandings only, but in our hearts and our affections, and this is that which makes obedience to it pleaſing and delightful to us. So that if you might be free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions and directions of the Word (with the ſervant in the Law) you would not value ſuch a libertie: You would not ſwear, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and run out into all exceſs of ryot, if you might becauſe your ſpirits have by grace an inward contrariety and antipathy againſt it: you would not ceaſe to pray, and hear, and perform religious duties if you might, becauſe your ſpirits have an inward ſweet complacencie in theſe things. If you thus keep the Word, it is a ſign that you are Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
               <p>As you muſt keep the Word wholly, and keep it cordially, ſo you muſt keep it conſtantly; you muſt keep it to the end, as the Prophet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                  <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.33. You muſt hold on in keeping it; you muſt perſiſt in your obedience to it, even to your lives end: that Chriſt may ſay at laſt concerning you, when you depart out of this world, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Father, <hi>Thou haſt given them to me, and they have kept
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:46169:130"/>
thy word.</hi> And indeed to obey it for a time, and then to throw it off again, is not to keep it, but to loſe it. Alas how many ſuch are there among us, in theſe latter times, who for a while were very diligent, and Inſtant in the ſtudy of the Scriptures, ſeem'd to be very cautious and exact to frame their lives in every thing according to the word of God, ſo that they would not vary from it in the leaſt particular. Or if they found themſelves at any time, in any thing to ſwerve from the direction of the Rule, they would judge themſelves for it. But now the Word the rule it ſelf is laid aſide, as an unneceſſary and a uſeleſs thing, as if it were not worthy the keeping any longer; there is no care at all to walk by it: when there are groſs and horrid deviations from it, they are not looked upon as matter of Humiliation or Contrition in the leaſt degree. I wiſh that ſuch would ſeriouſly conſider with themſelves, how Chriſt ſhall own them in the latter day, how he ſhall plead before his Father for them, that they have kept his word.</p>
               <p>Now, my Beloved, lay theſe things to heart, and never reſt till you have gotten this Character of thoſe that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, by the donation of the Father. Never ſatisfie your ſelves till you keep the Word of God in your lives by obeying it; till you keep it wholly, and till you keep it cordially, and till you keep it conſtantly: And then there is a bleſsing poured out upon you by the mouth of Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Bleſſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it,</hi> that is, that do not hear it only, but obey it. And to the ſame effect ſpeaks the Apoſtle <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 1.23. If as you look into the Law the word of God, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, ſo you continue in it, and are doers of the work, not forgetful hearers of it, but doers of the work, you ſhall be bleſſed in the deed: And that you may attain this bleſſedneſs that follows thoſe that are obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the word, I ſhall give you ſome direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You muſt ſeek to God to teach you, though you may learn to know it, as that a Caſtaway may do, yet you can never learn to keep it any other way; you ſhall never keep the word in the obedience of your lives, unleſs God and Chriſt teach you. <hi>David</hi> was very ſenſible of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore poured out his prayer to the Lord, Pſal. 119.33. <hi>Teach me O Lord the way of thy ſtatutes, and I will keep it to the end.</hi> When thou thy ſelf haſt taught me once, and not before, I ſhall walk according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall be obedient to it. It is not in the power of any in the world to teach a man to frame his life in every thing according to the word, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God himſelf do it. But if he undertake it once, if he be pleaſed to be our Teacher, all is well. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.20. and in the following verſe, <hi>ye have not ſo learned Chriſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>viz.</hi> to ſay and to profeſs that you are Chriſtians, and yet to live prophanely and licentiouſly, and lewdly ſtill, <hi>If ſo be that you have heard him, and been taught by him as the truth is in Jeſus.</hi> Why what doth he intend? what is it to be taught by him? he tells us in the following verſe, <hi>That you put off</hi> (touching the former converſation) <hi>the old man, and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind, and put on the new man.</hi> It is ſuch a kind of teaching whereby we are transferred and brought to the obedience of it: And therefore if you do indeed deſire to have
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46169:130"/>
your lives conformed to the rule and Word of God, ſeek to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to teach you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be ſure to ſet your ſelves to the obedience of it, out of hand; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinations and delays will daſh all. It is obſerved of the <hi>Coloſsians,</hi> that they obeyed the Word from the day they heard of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. So you my Brethren, do you grow practical from this day. It may be you are now convinced of many things, you think of this and that, in which your practice is not anſwerable to the rule; you have ſecret inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and it may be reſolutions to amend all, as <hi>David</hi> had, <hi>I have ſaid that I would keep thy Word,</hi> ſaith he to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.57. ſtrike now while it is hot; do as the ſame holy Prophet did, <hi>I made haſte and delayed not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to keep thy precepts,</hi> Pſal. 119.60. Aſſoon as I reſolved, <hi>I made haſte and ſet about it.</hi> If you have holy reſolutions wrought to practice any duty which you have hitherto neglected, up, and be doing preſently; do not permit ſuch reſolutions to grow cold, and die within you, leaſt you never have them more. I am perſwaded there are many ſouls in hell, who have purpoſed in many things to bring their practice to the Word, to abandon ſuch a ſin, and to ſet on ſuch a duty; they were reſolved upon the thing, but they could not do it yet, and ſo the Lord hath cut them off, and their delays have proved their ruine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If you will keep the Word of God in your lives by obeying it, you muſt find out and mortifie the luſts that hinder you in this buſineſs, or if you do not ſo, you may reſolve on this and that, but ſurely it will come to nothing; and therefore if you have within you any holy purpoſes of coming nearer to the Rule, of leaving ſuch a ſin, or ſetting upon ſuch a duty, think now what luſt, or what corruption there is in you, that will be like to make this bleſſed reſolution fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in you, and ſet the edge of your Petitions of your humiliation againſt this; for if you do not this, you do nothing. Many men have been very well reſolved to walk according to the Word in many things; but when they come to act their reſolutions, there is ſome luſt or other that prevails againſt them, and this they do not mortifie, and ſo are able to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Well then my Brethren, you have purpoſes perhaps to keep the Word of God in ſuch and ſuch particulars: You are extreamly ſenſible that you have failed, but now it ſhall be ſo no more: I but there is ſome luſt, or other, a luſt of pride, or covetouſneſs, or uncleanneſs, which if it be not mortified will blaſt all; ſtrike that, and kill that, and then you may with comfort hope that you ſhall approve your ſelves, ſuch as are given up to Chriſt, in that you keep his Word.</p>
               <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched the Character of thoſe who are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt by the donation of the Father; they are ſuch as keep his Word, that is, the Word of God the Father: So ſaith our Saviour here of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>they have kept thy Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the following verſes he proceeds to ſhew how they were brought to keep the Word of God, and by what means it came to paſs, that they receive it, and believed it, and embraced it, and obeyed it.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:46169:131"/>
Why ſaith our Saviour, they did it upon this account, becauſe they were perſwaded and convinced, that it was the very word which I received of my Father to deliver. They knew for certain that it was not any thing which I (as man) deviſed and invented of my ſelf, but it was the very meſſage which my Father put into my mouth, and therefore they gave heed to it. <hi>Now they have known that all things, whatſoever thou haſt given me are of thee, for I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this (if you obſerve it well) is both expreſſed and amplified. Firſt it is nakedly expreſſed, <hi>Now they have known that all things whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou haſt given me are of thee.</hi> Then it is amplyfied in the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſe, <hi>For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them,</hi> &amp;c. And here our Saviour doth theſe two things: Firſt, he declares his own fidelity in the delivery of his meſſage from his Father to his people, <hi>for I have given to them the words which thou gaveſt me,</hi> thoſe very words and no others. And then he ſhews the iſſue and event of this faithfulneſs of his in his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and that eſpecially in two reſpects: Firſt with relation to the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage which he brought, <hi>they have received them,</hi> ſaith he, that is, the words which I delivered to them in thy Name. Secondly, then with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to himſelf the Meſſenger, <hi>they have known ſurely that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi> Let us at this time make a little entrance on this diſcovery of our Saviour as it is naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed. <hi>Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me are of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe words as I have hinted formerly, my Brethren, are annexed to thoſe immediately before, which we have even now diſpatched, to ſhew the means and way by which our Saviours hearers came to keep the Word which he delivered to them from his Father. Why, ſaith our Saviour, this was a great inducement to it, becauſe they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it was of thee, that it was thy word indeed, and not my own. <hi>If I had ſpoken to them in my own Name,</hi> or brought my own word to them, they would never have received it. But this was that which made them keep thy word, becauſe they knew that it was thine. <hi>Now they have known that all things whatſoever thou haſt given me,</hi> (you muſt conceive it to deliver or declare to my Diſciples) or as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in the following verſe, <hi>all the words which thou haſt given me are of thee.</hi> So that the point apparently ſuggeſted here is plainly thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> They that will give the Word ſuch entertainment as it ought to have, muſt know for certain that it is the word of God.</head>
                  <p>Had not our Saviours hearers been convinced of this, had they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and apprehended that it came from him meerly as he was a man, they would never have believed it, or embraced it, and obeyed it
<pb facs="tcp:46169:131"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46169:132"/>
                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:46169:132"/>
as they did. But this was that which made them keep it in the ſenſe that hath been ſaid: becauſe they knew that that which Chriſt delivered to them was the Word of God. And to this end it is that Chriſt is ſo exactly cautious to perſwade his hearers ſtill, that the meſſage which he brings them is not of or from himſelf, but from his Father. <hi>My doctrine is not mine</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but his that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 7.16. <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf,</hi> he <hi>ſeeks his own glory; but he that ſeeks his glory that hath ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs is in him.</hi> And in the following Chapter at the 28. verſe, <hi>As my Father hath taught me, ſo I ſpeak. Even as the Father ſaid to me, ſo I ſpeak,</hi> Joh. 12.50. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf,</hi> Joh. 14.10. And this he beats ſo much upon, to gain the better credit, and reſpect and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to his Meſſage. By which he intimates that he could look for no acceptance, or regard among them, if that which he delivered to them were not Gods Word. It is obſervable in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that this was that which made him come to Chriſt, to hear him, and be taught by him, becauſe he was perſwaded that he was a Teacher come from God, as his own expreſſion is, <hi>John</hi> 3.2. that he had ſomewhat to deliver to him from the Lord. Had it not been for this perſwaſion he had never waited on him. And this was that which wrought upon the <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and brought them to a meet receiving of the Word, becauſe they looked upon it as the Word of God himſelf. So the Apoſtle teſtifies of them, 1 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>when ye received the Word which ye heard of us,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye received it not as the word of man, but as it is in truth the Word of God.</hi> If you had apprehended it to be the word of man, and not of God, you would not have regarded it, and entertained it as you did. But this was that which drew your hearts to ſuch an high account and eſtimation of it, becauſe you were perſwaded that it was in truth the Word of God; not in appearance only, and in the apprehenſions and conceits of men, but really in deed and truth the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>So that the point is plain, you ſee, They that will give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is ſuch reaſon for it, as amounts to demonſtration,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                     </label> the cleareſt and moſt evident that can be, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment due to it, as nothing elſe can draw us to, but this perſwaſion that it is the Word of God. If we conceive it to be nothing but the word of man, this apprehenſion will never raiſe the heart to ſuch an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, to ſuch an acceptation of it as belongs to it: This will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver draw the heart, to give it greater credence, or greater reverence or obedience then appertaineth to the word of man. Now this is infinitely ſhort of that which appertaineth to the Word of God. And therefore that we may come up to that, that we may give the Word ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as it ought to have, we muſt know for certain, that it is the Word of God, and this I ſhall exemplifie in many particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ye muſt know for certain that it is the Word of God, that we may give it ſuch entertainment as it ought to have in point of reverence. The Word of God muſt be received with holy fear: This carriage of the heart is due to that which hath ſo great and ſo divine an Author as God is; we ought to tremble at the Word of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5. To
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46169:133"/>
hearken to it, not with an ordinary meaſure, but with a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of fear; with ſuch a fear as worketh trembling. So did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Habakkuk,</hi> as you may ſee, Hab. 3.16. <hi>When I heard, my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voyce, rottenneſs was in my bones, and I trembled in my ſelf.</hi> And ſo the holy Prophet <hi>David,</hi> as he profeſſeth of himſelf, Pſal. 119.10. <hi>My heart trembleth for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements,</hi> (that is) of thy word, as ſome underſtand it. <hi>I fear and tremble at thy word,</hi> for that hath frequently the name of the Judgements of God, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, Pſal. 19.8. <hi>Shall a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the people not be afraid?</hi> it is the Prophets queſtion, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.6. By the City underſtand the Church of God; by the Trumpet, the word of God; and by the people, the hearers of this word: So that it is as if the Prophet ſhould have ſaid, Shall the word of God be pronounced, and the hearers not fear? as who ſhould ſay, that were a ſtrange and an incongruous thing indeed; So that you ſee they that will give the word ſuch entertainment as it ought to have, muſt hear it, and receive it with extraordinary fear and reverence. Now this they will never do, unleſs they know for certain, that it is the Word of God. If they be doubtful whether it be ſo, or if they look upon it as the word of man, they will be apt to diſregard it, and to give it no reſpect at all. Nothing but this perſwaſion that it is the Word of the Almighty, and the glorious God himſelf, will raiſe the heart to ſuch an high degree of fear and reverence as belongs to it. No other apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it will prevail to this effect, but this alone will ſurely do it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, 1 Cor. 14.24. <hi>If there come in an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiver or unlearned perſon, he is convinced, he is judged, the ſecrets of his heart are manifeſted by the word,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there. And what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>So falling down upon his face, he will worſhip God and ſay, that God is in you of a truth:</hi> when he perceives that God is in you, that you ſpeak from God, that that which you deliver is the word of God, then he will fear and tremble and fall down and worſhip God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt know for certain that it is word of God, that we may give it ſuch entertainment as it ought to have, in point of credit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. For you muſt know my Brethren, that we owe this ſpecial and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar honor to the word of God, beyond the word of any man, to give compleat and abſolute aſſent and credit to it. Though it be never ſo unlikely, never ſo much againſt appearance and above reaſon; yet when the Lord hath ſpoken it, when we have his word for it, we ought to make no doubt or queſtion of it. Thoſe truths which own him for the Author of them, do not admit of any doubtful diſquiſition, but rather call for abſolute belief: The very thoughts and cogitations muſt be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated to faith, when it appears that God hath ſpoken. And therefore it is charged home on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as a very great offence that they believed not his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.24. And on the other ſide it is obſerved to the praiſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> that they believed God, that is, the word of God, his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſent them by the Prophet <hi>Jonah, Jonah</hi> 3.5. And yet it was a moſt unlikely one. VVhat probability that forty days ſhould put a period to all the happineſs and luſtre of ſuch a flouriſhing and famous City:
<pb facs="tcp:46169:133"/>
                     <pb facs="tcp:46169:134"/>
                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:46169:134"/>
However they believed it, becauſe it was the word of God. You ſee then what our duty is in this reſpect, to hear the word with abſolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, this is the entertainment which we ought to give it.</p>
                  <p>Now this it will not find amongſt us, unleſs we be perſwaded that it is the word of God; the word of man can never challenge this from us, for <hi>men are lyars,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, they are deceitful on the ballance. Though they give us good words, yet when we come to prove them, and to try them, many times they prove too light: Thoſe that we think are beſt to be believed among them, may deceive us; ſo that there is no reaſon in the world why we ſhould take what they deliver upon truſt, becauſe they deliver it. And therefore we are bid to ſift the doctrines and to try the ſpirits, becauſe there be that ſay, The Lord hath ſaid, when the Lord hath not ſpoken. But when the word appears to be of God, this apprehenſion and perſwaſion is enough to ſilence all objections, that in appearance may be made againſt it. This alone will raiſe the heart, to entertain it with that abſolute belief where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it ought to be received: while we remember that the God who is the Author of it, is the God of Truth, yea he is the Truth it ſelf: His ſaying always <hi>is a faithful ſaying,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. becauſe it is the ſaying of the faithful God, and therefore <hi>worthy of all acceptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt know for certain that it is the word of God, that we may give it ſuch entertainment as it ought to have, in point of humble reſignation and ſubmiſſion to it. For this belongeth to the word of God, that we quarrel not againſt it, but that we juſtifie it and ſubmit to it. So it is ſaid of <hi>Johns</hi> hearers, Luk. 7.29, 30. <hi>All the people that heard him, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified God;</hi> yea the very <hi>Publicans,</hi> the worſt among them, as it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there in that place. So holy <hi>David, I eſteem all thy Commandements concerning all things to be right,</hi> Pſal. 119.128. yea he will have him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be juſtified when he ſpeaketh, and clear even when he judgeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.4. when it is hardeſt to acquit him, and to ſtoop to him. So that you ſee, my Brethren, we muſt juſtifie the Lord in his reproofs and threatnings, how ſharp ſoever they may ſeem to be. As <hi>Rehoboam</hi> and the Princes did when they were ſharply menaced be the Prophet, they replyed not, they fretted not againſt him, but confeſſed <hi>the Lord is righteous,</hi> 2 Chron. 12.6. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when <hi>Iſaiah</hi> dealt ſo roundly with him in the Name of God, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord which thou haſt ſpoken,</hi> 2 King. 20.19. Yea, God requireth this of all his people, that they ſay Amen to every Curſe of his, and that they ſet their ſeal to it, as you may ſee, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26.</p>
                  <p>This is the entertainment which we ought to give the word of God in this reſpect, meekly and humbly to ſubmit to it, even when it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be moſt againſt us; and not ſo much as once to mutter or repine at it. Now this we ſhall not do unleſs we look upon it as the word of God. Nothing but ſuch an apprehenſion of it will bring the heart to ſuch a temper, and put the ſpirit into ſuch a frame as this is. That which comes to us under the notion of the word of man, will never be ſo yeilded to; No, the heart will boyl, and rage, and riſe againſt it. But when it hath the ſtamp of God upon it, it ſtoops the ſpirit to ſubmiſſion.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46169:135"/>
Such entertainment (you may ſee) it found in <hi>Eli</hi> upon this account, <hi>It is the Lord:</hi> when <hi>Samuel</hi> who was then a child, declared to him what the Lord reſolved to bring upon him and his houſe, ſaith <hi>Eli,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me to be humble and ſumit to this, and not to murmur and repine againſt it; for <hi>it is the Lord,</hi> 1 Sam. 3.18. As <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſa. 38.15. <hi>What ſhall I ſay? for he hath ſaid it to me.</hi> And ſo in every truth that is delivered to us, in every precept that is laid upon us, in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that is given us, in every Commination that is thundred out againſt us, if we conſider with our ſelves, whoever be the meſſenger, <hi>it is the Lord</hi> that ſpeaketh this, it is the word of God and not of man, this and only this will make us in all humility to ſtoop to it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We muſt know for certain that it is the word of God, that we may give it ſuch entertainment as it ought to have, in point of obedience. Herein the word of God is ſingular, it muſt be abſolutely and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obeyed, and that not only with the outward but alſo with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. It doth not only take command upon the members, but even the ſpirit and the conſcience muſt be ſubject to it. And that without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, without queſtion, without exception, without reſervation; aſſoon as that which is delivered to us, appears to be the word of God, there is no room for diſputation, or expoſtulation, but obedience. <hi>All that the Lord Commandeth we muſt do,</hi> Exod. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.8. if he command it, we muſt do it. This is the entertainment which we ought to give the word of God. The word of man can challenge no ſuch honour and reſpect from us. All the commands of men are limited, and are to be obeyed ſo far, and but ſo far as they agree with the commands of God, or elſe at leaſt as they are not repugnant to them. And conſequently while we look on any word as that which comes from man, or as that which is of man, we cannot yeild it ſuch obedience as is peculiar to the word of God. But when we know once that it is of God, when we are certain that he is the Author of it, we ſhall no longer think our ſelves at liberty to obey or diſobey. No, this perſwaſion will convince us, that it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to reſign our ſelves to the obedience of this word of his, who is ſuch a Law-giver as is able either to ſave or to deſtroy, and with whom every diſobedience receiveth a juſt recompence of reward.</p>

Alas, how is it diſreſpected and deſpiſe everv where? how little credit doth it find with me? how do their hearts and ſpirits riſe againſt it, when it meeteth with corruptions, and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46169:135"/>
croſſes them in their ways and their humors? how far are they from yeilding abſolute obedience to it, in every thing that it requires of them? And what's the cauſe of all this? Truly the main and principal is this, that they believe it not to be indeed and truth the word of God. When it is read or preached to them, either they call the matter into queſtion, and are in very great ſuſpenſe whether it be the word of God or no; or elſe they peremptorily reſolve as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>It is not he,</hi> Jer. 5.12. It is not God that ſpeaks to us, this is not the word of God, and then no wonder though it be neglected and deſpiſed by them. They hear a man, and ſo accordingly reſolve that that which is delivered to them, is of man, and that it hath no higher Author then the man that ſpeaks to them. And ſome of them will now and then expreſs themſelves, Preachers may ſay their pleaſure in a pulpit, and the like. And hence it is, my Brethen, that their reſpect and entertainment of it, is anſwerable to their apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, ſuch as belongeth to the word of man and no more. They regard it and believe it and obey it juſt as farre as they themſelves pleaſe.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay perhaps, if you could hear the Lord himſelf ſpeak to you, Oh how would you fear before him, how would you ſtoop to him, how would you yeild obedience to his voyce! But who is this that you hear? a man ſuch as your ſelves are, whoſe weakneſſes and failings and infirmities are known to you.</p>
               <p>Oh but remember that though you have this treaſure in earthen veſſels, yet it is a treaſure ſtill, and it is of God ſtill; That all the meſſengers of God in their regular preſcripts ought to be inſtead of God, and inſtead of Chriſt to you; That it is not they that ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt himſelf that ſpeaketh by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. And therefore even as he that heareth them, heareth God; ſo on the other ſide, he that deſpiſeth them, deſpiſeth God himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. They were but men that preached to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the Apoſtle and his fellows; ſo that they might have made the ſame objection, and ſo have kept themſelves from due and reverend entertainment of the word which they delivered: But they did other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, as the Apoſtle teſtifies of them to their commendation, 1 Theſſ. 2.13. <hi>The word which ye heard of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle there) <hi>ye received it not as the word of men,</hi> though ye received it of us who are but men, yet <hi>ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that they that will give the word of God ſuch entertainment <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> as it ought to have, muſt know, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> You ſee then what you are to do, if you deſire to entertain the word aright, and to receive it in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you ought to do; you find perhaps much ſlightneſs and irreverence and ſtubbornneſs and diſobedience in your hearts againſt it; you cannot bring your hearts to ſuch a temper, in the reading or the hearing of it, as you unfeignedly deſire to do; your thoughts are wandring, or your hearts are unbelieving, or your luſts are ſtruggling, or your corrupt and carnal reaſon is gainſaying, while you are attending on it. Something or other there is ſtill that hinders you from a right receiving of it. And this is a continual grief and burthen to you. Now, my Beloved, I will ſhew you how you ſhall help all this at once: You muſt come to be aſſured,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:46169:136"/>
to know for certain that that which is delivered in or from the Scripture, is the word of God; If you have any ſecret unbelief of this, any doubt in this particular, do what you will in all reſpects beſides, and labour what you can, you will never bring your ſelves to give the word ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment as it ought to have. This one defect will hurt you more then all the means that you can uſe beſides will help you. And truly Satan (knowing well of how great conſequence it is) endeavours what he can, if not to overthrow us utterly, at leaſt to weaken us in this aſſurance. And if he can but weaken us in this, and make as faint in this aſſurance, that that which is delivered in or from the Scripture is the word of God, he knows he doth much work at once: He weakens by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion our Reverence, our Aſſent, Submiſſion, and Obedience with it.</p>
               <p>And verily, my Brethren, though it may not be perceived, yet this is that which lies at the bottom, and is the main original of all that ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and incredulity and obſtinacy, and diſobedience, which many of the pretious Saints of God diſcover in themſelves, in relation to the word, and know not how to remedy. They are not firmly and inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſetled and confirmed in this perſwaſion that it is the word of God. Their faith is weak in this particular, and ſo accordingly they are weak in all thoſe things which concern the due and right receiving of it. For even as if a man believe it not to be the word of God at all, he will give it no fear, no faith, no ſubmiſſion, no obedience: So on the other ſide, if he believe it weakly, and with many heſitations, he will accordingly be weak in all theſe; he will be on and of, and up and down, according to the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and the flowings of his faith.</p>
               <p>And therefore I beſeech you, my Beloved, ſtrive and labour what you can to ſtrengthen and fortifie your ſelves in this perſwaſion, which is of ſuch concernment to you. And certainly the beſt among us have need of Confirmation here, for we are apt ſometimes to waver and to have doubtful thoughts about it. And they that are moſt free from theſe, have yet defects and imperfections in their faith of this as well as other parts of holy truth. They have not yet attained to ſuch a pitch, but they may be adding to it, and go on to further meaſures and degrees. And therefore let it be our labour and endeavour to encreaſe our faith in this particular, and to grow up to full aſſurance of this inviolable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that That which is delivered in the Scripture is verily the word of God.</p>
               <p>Now that you may know this for certain, I ſhall do two things: Firſt, I ſhall lay down ſuch conſiderations as make it credible: And in the next place I ſhall ſhew you what you are to do that it may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to you.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, my Brethren, there are many things that make it very credible, that whatſoever is delivered in or from the Srripture, is the word of God. I ſhall name a few of them, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. The evident accompliſhment of all the propheſies contained in it. I mean of all, excepting thoſe the time of whoſe fulfilling is not come in. It hath been Ruled long ago, that <hi>De futuris contingentibus non
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:46169:136"/>
datur determinata veritas.</hi> Man cannot certainly determine of future things that are contingent: He cannot do it of himſelf, and by his own fore-ſight. Now this the Prophets and Apoſtles did (as by the iſſue and event is manifeſt) and therefore it appears that in their propheſies they were directed by the All-knowing and Omniſcient God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is made credible by the harmonious teſtimony of the Church in every age who have aſſented to it, and acknowledged and received it, as that which comprehendeth and containeth the divine and holy Oracles of God himſelf. And however divers Churches have been at very ſharp diſſentions about divers other things, yet herein they have ſtill agreed, and none of them have once ſo much as queſtioned, whether the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture be the word of God or no.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is made credible by the almoſt incredible conſent between the Scribes and Pen-men of it; who writing in ſuch divers places, tongues, and ſeaſons, muſt needs unreconcileably have croſſed and thwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one another, had they been guided by their own ſpirits. We ſee how men that write upon the Scripture differ in their Expoſitions of it, and ſpeak directly one againſt another. How more would the Prophets and Apoſtles then have jarred, unleſs they had been all directed by the ſame Spirit? We know in reaſon, men would far more eaſily agree in Explicating Principles already made, then in compoſing thoſe Principles and Rules themſelves, if every man had liberty to frame what Axioms he thought good himſelf, and to ſet them down for text. And therefore certainly the Pen-men of the Scripture were guided all by one, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ghoſt himſelf who lead them into one Truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is made credible by the effectual and mighty working of it on the hearts and ſouls of men, above all other writings whatſoever; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be carried in a low and eaſie ſtile, yet it commands us, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails upon us more then all the eloquence of men and Angels could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly do, were it united all together. And herein I appeal to Gods people, let them conſider with themſelves what wonderful effects it hath wrought upon their hearts; how it hath pierced in and made a ſeparation between their very joynts and marrow; how it hath even told them all that ever they have done; how it hath caſt them down with unutterable ſorrow; and then raiſed them up again with joy unſpeakable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. How it hath altered them and changed them, and turned them clean about, and made them to renounce their pleaſures and delights, their wills, their reaſons, their deſires, yea, to deny themſelves, that they might walk by this Rule.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The blood of many Martyrs gives teſtimony to the Scripture, that it is the word of God; who but for this divine and ſaving Truth, and by his power and might whoſe Truth it is, would hardly have endured the rage and fury of the flames, the violence of the tormentors. We read indeed that divers Hereticks have ſuffered exquiſite and horrid tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for their groſs opinions and conceits, as we have many inſtances in Church ſtory. But it is to be conſidered that they did it for the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, though falſely and corruptly apprehended and applyed. Where hath been the Jew, or Turk, who for his Talmud or his Alchoran (which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46169:137"/>
are the Scriptures they receive and uſe) hath put himſelf into the hands of the Tormentors.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch things as theſe, do make it in it ſelf extremely credible that that which is delivered in the Scripture is the word of God. But yet they may not ſo take hold upon us to convince us notwithſtanding, they may not chaſe our ſcruples all away, nor clear up all doubts, unleſs ſome further thing be done, to make it credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us, and to make us know for certain, that it is the word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This is the proper and peculiar work of Gods Spirit. The ſelf ſame Spirit which delivered it to the Apoſtles and the Prophets who were the Scribes and Pen-men of the Scripture, and made them know that it was the word of God which they delivered, muſt ſatisfie us and convince us alſo that it is the word of God which we receive. No other means will do without this, but this and this alone will do it. This is an abſolute and ſatisfying teſtimony of it ſelf which carries all before it, and puts the matter out of queſtion where it comes. Other things may make it credible; but this and this alone will make it clearly and demonſtratively ſure to us, that it is in deed and truth the word of God.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask me how the Holy Spirit doth this great work, which nothing elſe beſides can do. I anſwer that it doth it principally two ways. Firſt by removing thoſe impediments which hinder this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; And ſecondly by giving us thoſe gifts and graces, which make us able to receive it.</p>
               <p>Firſt by removing thoſe impediments that hinder this aſſurance. There is a double hinderance or impediment in every man by nature. Firſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance whereby our eyes are cloſed as it were. The word hath light enough, my Brethren, in and of it ſelf to ſhew it ſelf to us, to manifeſt it ſelf to us, as it is indeed; but we are blind and cannot ſee it. The ſecond hinderance is corruption, by means of which, although we ſee it, we cannot of our ſelves but hate it, and diſlike it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.</p>
               <p>Theſe two the Holy Spirit cureth and removeth by a double remedy. The firſt illumination, reſtoring our decayed underſtandings to ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and meaſures of their firſt light, opening our eyes that we may ſee the wonders of the word, and ſo be ſatisfied that it is the word of God. The next, Sanctification, infuſing into our deſires and our affections ſome degrees and meaſures of their firſt holineſs. And by this work of Gods Spirit, opening the eyes of our blind minds, that we may underſtand the Scriptures, and ſee thoſe admirable rays and beams of divine and heavenly light that ſhine in them: And alſo rectifying our corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that we may love them and embrace them, we come to be aſſured that the Scripture is indeed and truth the word of God.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee the Spirit works not this aſſurance in us by adding any thing to Gods word, by curing any failing or defect in it, but only by bringing it into the light, and repreſenting it unto us as indeed it is. The Spirit doth not make it credible, for it is ſo in it ſelf abundantly beyond all poſſibility, even of the beſt addition, but it makes it ſo to us, by curing
<pb facs="tcp:46169:137"/>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46169:138"/>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:46169:138"/>
and removing the impediments, and ſupplying the defects which are in us, by means of which we cannot apprehend it as it is. And I mention this the rather, becauſe ſome have been apt to ſay of late, the Word without the Spirit is no more to them then any other Book, or any other piece of writing. Now if their meaning be to blame themſelves in this, and to import that their corruption and their ignorance is ſuch, that unleſs the Spirit help them they cannot come to underſtand it, or look upon it as better then another Book, it may receive a pretty fair conſtruction. But if their intention be to undervalue and abaſe the Scripture, as if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and innate and real worth thereof depended wholly on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits revelation, it is a horrid derogation from the pretious Word of God. It's true indeed, without the Spirit it may be no more to us then any other book; ſuch is the darkneſs and prophaneſs of our hearts; but yet it is more in it ſelf, whether the Spirit ſhew it us or no. The Spirit in this work of his doth not make it in it ſelf to be the Word of God, but only to appear ſo. It makes no alteration in the Word, but in our ſelves. When firſt it tells us and aſſures us that it is the Word of God, it was clearly ſo before, or elſe it certifies us of a falſehood and untruth, only it was not apprehended and believed to be ſo This is indeed the Spirits work, to make us know for certain that it is the Word of God, it is not to be done without it.</p>
               <p>And therefore that we may attain to this perſwaſion, we muſt do theſe two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We muſt cry to God to ſend down his Holy Spirit, to give in this aſſurance to us: To ſet his ſeal and teſtimony to it, that it is the Word of God; and ſo to put the matter out of all queſtion, to ſatisfie us without any further ſcruple, that all that is delivered in it, is of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt take in and cheriſh all the light, that from the Spirit ſhines upon the ſoul. Sometimes a beam breaks in upon us on a ſudden, it makes us ſee and know for certain that it is the Word of God, ſo that all doubt is baniſhed quite in that particular. But we neglect it, and permit our thoughts to be miſled to other things, before we fix and ſettle upon this perſwaſion; and ſo our aſſurance fails, and our doubts return again. The Spirit offers clear illumination and conviction, and we take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and therefore it is juſt it ſhould be withdrawn again. And thus far of our Saviours declaration of his Apoſtles and Diſciples due and ready entertainment of the Word which he delivered, together with the ground of it, as it is barely mentioned only.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to look upon it as it is amplified in the following verſe, <hi>For I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here as I have ſhewed you formerly, our Saviour doth theſe two things: Firſt he declares his own fidelity, in the delivery of his meſſage from his Father to his people; <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> And ſecondly, he ſhews the iſſue and event of this fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his, in his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and that eſpecially in two
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:46169:139"/>
reſpects: Both with Relation to the meſſage which he brought, and alſo with relation to himſelf the Meſſenger. Firſt, With Relation to the Meſſage which he brought, <hi>They have received them,</hi> ſaith he, that is, the words which I delivered to them in thy name. Secondly, Then with relation to himſelf the Meſſenger, <hi>They have known ſurely that I came from thee, and have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the firſt thing which our Saviour doth, he pleads his own fidelity in the delivery of his Meſſage from his Father to his people, <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words which thou haſt given me as the principal Author, I as the Meſſenger and the Embaſſador from thee have given them. Thoſe very words and no other: No leſs, no nor more. For both of thoſe are clearly intimated here; <hi>I have given them the words which thou haſt given me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No other words, but thoſe only. I have not given them a word more. Nothing of my own deviſing, nothing of my own inventing; that which I have received from thee, and only that, I have declared to them, I have not added one word.</p>
               <p>And as I have not added, ſo neither on the other ſide have I diminiſhed one word. <hi>I have given them the words which thou haſt given me,</hi> every one of thoſe words, I have not kept a word back, but have delivered all to them; <hi>That which thou haſt given me,</hi> they have had without abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or diminution in the leaſt degree.</p>
               <p>So that you ſee, my Brethren,</p>

And this he pleads and urges in my Text, you ſee, to ſhew his faithfulneſs, and to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how well he had diſcharged the truſt that was repoſed in him by his Father. <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That I may fully and diſtinctly clear the point, I ſhall evince that Chriſt hath ſhewed himſelf a faithful Prophet, a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to his people: Firſt in this reſpect, that he hath added nothing to his Meſſage; And ſecondly in this reſpect, that he hath taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from it.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt hath ſhewed himſelf a faithful Prophet, a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to his people, in this reſpect, that he hath added no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his Meſſage. So he affirmeth of himſelf you ſee, who is the truth it ſelf, and cannot lye; <hi>I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> He ſpeaks it here excluſively, no other words but thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; We find our Saviour ſometimes ſtiled <hi>him whom God hath ſent, the

Angel and the Meſſenger of God,</hi> as you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. Yea the Apoſtle, Heb. 3.1. <hi>Conſider the Apoſtle and High Prieſt of our profeſsion Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And herein he hath done his part, that he hath been exact in the diſcharge of his Apoſtleſhip, and the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his Errand to the Church. He hath not put in any thing, no not a word, that may be called his own, in oppoſition to his Father. He hath not gone beyond the bounds of his Commiſſion in the leaſt degree. And this he pleadeth very often in the Goſpel, and beateth very much upon it, that he might be underſtood, and that he might not be miſtaken, becauſe it was of ſuch concernment to the ſucceſs and efficacy of his meſſage; <hi>Even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> That [ſo] reſpecteth not ſo much the manner as the matter of his ſpeaking, as you may eaſily diſcern, if you will look back to the words immediately before, <hi>What I ſpeak, even as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> The things which I deliver are the ſame which I received of my Father. That only I have ſaid and nothing elſe, not a word beſides that. And therefore he inculcates frequently, that he ſpeaks not of himſelf, it is a phraſe he uſeth often. His meaning is not, that he ſpeaks not of his own ſtrength, but that he ſpeaks not of his own deviſing, he utters nothing but that which is committed to him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>The words I ſpeak,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeak not of my ſelf,</hi> Joh. 14.10. <hi>but the Father that is in me.</hi> They come originally from my Father, and I do not adde ſo much as one of my own words.</p>
                  <p>And even as Chriſt hath ſhewed himſelf a faithful Prophet, a faithful <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Meſſenger from his Father to his people in this reſpect, that he hath added nothing to his Meſſage; So in this reſpect alſo that he hath taken nothing from it. He hath delivered it intire, declared it fully and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly to his people; <hi>I have given to them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the words which thou gaveſt me:</hi> you muſt conceive it All thoſe words; I have not kept a word from them; with which accords his proteſtation to his Apoſtles and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when he was about to leave them, Joh. 15.15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not ſervants, for the ſervant knows not what his Lord doth, but I have called you friends.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you;</hi> In this reſpect I have uſed you like friends, that I have told you all my Fathers Councel, I have acquainted you with all, without any reſervation. All that he hath delivered to me as the Prophet of the Church, and as a Meſſenger from him to you; I have exactly and compleatly made it known to you.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me how this accordeth with his own expreſſion to his Apoſtles at another time, and in another place,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> the Chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that even now alleadged, Joh. 16.12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay to you, but ye cannot bear them now,</hi> as if he ſhould have added, therefore I will not ſpeak them now; and how then could he ſay before, <hi>I have made known all things to you?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly, my Brethren, he might ſay it very well. He had indeed made known all things to them, that were to be known by them:<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I mean as yet, in the Condition they were in at that time. All things which he heard from God the Father, with this intent that they ſhould hear them, and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46169:140"/>
be made acquainted with them, he had imparted to them to the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: ſo that he had been faithful in the buſineſs. There is no doubt our Saviour Chriſt as man had many things revealed to him from his Father, which he inſtilled not into his Diſciples; for he was perfect in regard of knowledge, and they were not ſo, nor could be ſo in this world. But whatſoever was communicated to him as the Mediator and the Prophet of the Church in that behalf, and for the information and behoof of his people, all this he manifeſted and made known to them again, as far as the eſtate which they were in would bear it, and their condition did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it: And this he clearly intimateth in the fore-alleadged place, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay to you, but ye cannot bear them now;</hi> And to what end ſhould Chriſt ſay that which he knew they could not yet bear? why ſhould he lay a burthen on them, which was too heavy for their ſhoulders?</p>
                  <p>But if he had ſaid all before, how had he many things to ſay yet? He had ſaid all that was to be ſaid before, all that his Father had appointed him to ſay, and he had many things to ſay, that were not to be ſaid yet, becauſe they were not ſuitable to the condition they were in at that time. But did our Saviour ſay them afterwards? or if he had many things to ſay, and did not ſay them, how was he ſuch a faithful meſſenger (as I have ſhewn) from his Father to his people?</p>
                  <p>For clearing this, we muſt diſtinguiſh of our Saviours ſayings; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he was to ſay to his Apoſtles and Diſciples with his own immediate voyce, while he was converſant upon the earth. Other things he was to ſay by his Spirit afterwards, and he was very faithfull both ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What things he was to ſay to his Apoſtles and Diſciples with his own immediate voyce, he ſaid all thoſe things. He kept nothing back from them. He taught them leſſon after leſſon, ſtill as they could learn. And ſo he carryed them along, as long as he remained among them: So that he might have ſaid at any time while he was with them, I have made known all to you, all that you are yet to know. And whereas he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the cited place, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay to you,</hi> if they were ſuch as he was himſelf to ſpeak, to utter to them with his own mouth, there is no queſtion to be made, he ſpake them afterwards. before he left them, and aſcended to his Father. And it is manifeſt, that after he was riſen, he converſed with them forty days, talking of myſterious things, ſpeaking of things pertaining to the Kingdom, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7. The Kingdom which had been ſet up in the hearts of a few poor deſpiſed ones before, but was now to be erected in the Church. Theſe and ſuch things as theſe they could not hear till now, and therefore though our Saviour had theſe things to ſay, yet he ſaid them not till now: And now he ſaid them that he might be faithful, and that he might diſcharge the truſt, that was repoſed in him by his Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But there were other things which he was not to ſay to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, by his own immediate voyce, while he was converſant among them, but by his Spirit afterward, when he had left them. And theſe he ſaid accordingly by that Spirit. And this is chiefly aimed at,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:46169:140"/>
and is the main intention of the fore-alleadged Text, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay to you, but you cannot bear them yet.</hi> But what then? did he ſay them afterwards? Yes, he ſaid them afterwards by his Spirit, and what the Spirit ſaid, he ſaid. And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all truth; For he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he ſhall hear (viz.</hi> of me) <hi>that ſhall he ſpeak. He ſhall receive of me, and ſhall ſhew it unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>While Chriſt was converſant with his Apoſtles in the fleſh, they were capable of nothing in a manner. It was but little they could bear then, and therefore there was little to be ſhewed to them. But when he was aſcended once, their hearts were preſently enlarged to a capacity of greater meaſures and degrees of knowledge. And Chriſt was now accordingly to ſhew them (and the Church by them) much more by his Spirit: which he performed with all fidelity, as the event hath manifeſted and declared.</p>
                  <p>The point you ſee is fully cleared; Chriſt hath approved himſelf a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to his people. For he hath added nothing to his meſſage, and he hath taken nothing from it. All the words his Father gave him to deliver by himſelf and by his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate voyce, he hath delivered. All that he gave him to deliver by his Spirit, all theſe he hath delivered too; and ſo he hath been abſolutely and exactly faithful every way.</p>
                  <p>Hath Chriſt approved himſelf a faithful Prophet to the Church, a <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> faithful Meſſenger? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hath he not failed in ſpeaking any thing that he ſhould have concealed, or in concealing any thing he ſhould have ſpoken? hath he not ſpoken ſo much as a word too little, or a word too much? This then may ſerve to teach us divers things; As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To hear this Prophet, and diligently to obſerve and mark all that he ſpeaks to us: He hath no looſe words, no vain expreſſions, nothing too little, or too much in that which he delivered to us, and therefore it muſt be the better noted, and the more valued. The words of men, yea, the exacteſt of them are ſometimes defective, and ſometimes redundant. The words of Chriſt are not ſo. I ſpeak not this that you ſhould do as ſome of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> did. I am for <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith one, I am for <hi>Cephas,</hi> ſaid another; I am for neither of them, ſaid a third, I am for Chriſt only. That which Chriſt himſelf ſaid, I will hear, and I will read, but I will hear no other man; I would not have you hear Chriſt, ſo as to hear none but him. But I would have you hear Chriſt, ſo as to hear none like him, for <hi>never man ſpake like this man.</hi> And therefore when we meet with his words, let us take ſpecial notice of them, let us fix and dwell upon them, and let them reſt and dwell in us. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in us richly:</hi> Let us have an eye to mark them, an ear to hear them, and a heart to keep them, as <hi>Mary</hi> had, of whom it is recorded, that <hi>ſhe kept all his ſayings in her heart.</hi> How carefully did the Apoſtle keep that which our Saviour ſpake, though it be no where mentioned in the Goſpel, and wiſhes other men to do ſo too! Act. 20.35. <hi>Remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</hi>
                     <pb n="238" facs="tcp:46169:141"/>
And ſo he mindeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of that whith Chriſt himſelf ſpake. <hi>To the marryed, I command, and yet not I, but the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. As intimating that the words which dropped from his lips, did challenge ſingular regard from them. And ſuch regard, my Brethren, let them have from us, when we meet with his Prayers, his Sermons, his Sayings; let us hear this Prophet, and hear him ſo to be obedient to him.</p>
                  <p>It was a dangerous thing you know, to refuſe to hear <hi>Moſes; he that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, was to die without mercy.</hi> But it is much more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to refuſe to hear Chriſt. There is a ſorer puniſhment for ſuch, <hi>Heb</hi> 10.28. It went very hard with thoſe who refuſed the word that was ſpoken by Angels. But if we refuſe the word that was ſpoken by Chriſt, and do it finally, there is but one way with us, we are gone without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, (for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it) <hi>and every tranſgreſsion and diſobedience received a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward; How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation,</hi> which was ſpoken by the Lord? If we hear him not, we die, and that without mercy too. But if we hear him and obey him, we ſhall live, and that for ever. The words that he ſpake are ſpirit and life: And if a man keep his ſayings, he ſhall never ſee death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſhould teach us in the ſecond place, to truſt him; ſince he is ſuch a faithful Meſſenger that he varies not a word, we may well rely upon him, and believe him to the utmoſt. His words are all heavenly, all of God; he hath given us thoſe words, that are given him of the Father, all thoſe, and none but thoſe; and why then ſhould we not depend upon them, for our direction, for our Conſolation, and truſt him perfectly in all caſes?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To try other Prophets by this Prophet, other Meſſengers by this Meſſenger, and ſo accordingly to embrace them, or reject them. Other men that come from God really or in pretence, may ſpeak more or ſpeak leſs then he hath put into their mouths; Chriſt hath ſaid neither more nor leſs: and therefore let us always try their Meſſages by his Meſſage; if they agree with his, let us embrace them; but if they diſagree, let us reject them.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Hath Chriſt himſelf approved himſelf a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to his people, in this reſpect, that he hath added nothing to his Meſſage? That he hath not delivered ſo much as a word more? Then ſurely not a word of his muſt be neglected by us, nor ſlightly paſſed over, without the moſt exact examination. All the words of Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:46169:141"/>
have weight in them, and therefore they muſt all be weighed, by them that handle them, or read, or hear them. Every word that he delivered comes from heaven, it is given him of his Father, as you have it in my Text. And do you think his Father would give down from heaven, ſo much as one vain word to be delivered by him to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? And if there be not one ſuperfluous word in his Meſſage, then certainly there is not one to be unadviſedly and lightly paſſed over by us. And therefore let it be our care to pry into, and ſtudy every word of Jeſus Chriſt which he hath left upon record in Scripture, to ſift it and to ſcan it to the very utmoſt, to ſeek to God by earneſt prayer to open and unfold it to us, that nothing in it (as far as it is poſſible) may ſcape us unobſerved.</p>
               <p>And truly, my Beloved, this deſerves the more to be conſidered by us, becauſe we know not what we loſe ſometimes by our neglect in this particular: by ſlight and careleſs handling, reading or hearing of the words of Chriſt; Oh the ineſtimable hidden worth that is wrapt up ſometimes in one of his expreſſions, and we take no notice of it! Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are ignorant of the Original, the Language and the Tongue in which he ſpeaks, and ſo cannot: or elſe we are negligent and idle and remiſs, and ſo do not dive in it. It is not to be imagined what a world of light and information in deep and myſterious things, of ſweet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of precious Conſolation we loſe by this means. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we labour to expound the Scripture, when we read, or when we hear it, let us not look upon a ſentence, or a verſe in groſs; and ſo indeavour to find out the general intent and drift and meaning of it, but let us ſcan and ſtudy every word. Were there any looſe expreſſions, as there are in other writings, that carry nothing of ſolidity and weight in them, we might very well omit them, and not ſpend our thoughts upon them. But there is not a word to ſpare in that which Jeſus Chriſt delivers from his Father to his people; nothing but what is neceſſary to expreſs ſome matter of importance and concernment to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us value it and fiſt it well, that we may know the mind of God, and the mind of Chriſt in it.</p>
               <p>Hath Chriſt approved himſelf a faithful Meſſenger from his Father to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> his people, in this reſpect, that he hath taken nothing from his meſſage? Then let us ſeek no further for direction in matters that concern ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but let us ſatisfie our ſelves with that which Chriſt hath brought us from his Father. Indeed if he were any way defective, there were ſome colourable reaſon then, why we ſhould labour to ſupply him (as the Papiſts do) with their Traditions and unwritten Verities, and ſo botch up as well as we are able, that which he hath left unperfect. But ſince he hath delivered to us all that his Father put into his mouth, and hath not kept a word back; Oh let us reſt in the diſcovery he hath made, as that <hi>which of it ſelf is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> Let us beware of itching after novelties, and hearkning after new and ſtrange diſcoveries, ſuch as Chriſt hath never made, as many do in theſe days. Oh let not any of us who have heard and learned Chriſt, turn away from wholeſome doctrine, and be turned after fables, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:46169:142"/>
ſpeaks; <hi>Let us not leave the Living Fountain, and go to broken Ciſterns that will hold no water.</hi> But let us ſtick to Jeſus Chriſt, and ſatisfie our ſelves with that which he hath taught us in the Scripture, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending in it all that is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But here to clear my ſelf a little that I may not be miſtaken, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that many neceſſary things are not expreſly delivered to us by our Saviour from his Father; and yet his meſſage is compleat for all that: For though they be not clearly mentioned and ſet down <hi>diſertis verbis,</hi> they may by manifeſt and neceſſary conſequence be gathered and deduced from that which he hath taught us in the Scripture. And to this end I ſhall deſire you to take notice of theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Where generals are taught us, there all particulars compriſed in them, and comprehended under them, are in the purpoſe and intention of our Saviour taught alſo; as when he interdicteth any ſin, ſuppoſe it murther, or adultery, there all the ſorts and kinds and meaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of that corruption, are with it interdicted and condemned.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Where principles and cauſes are delivered to us, there the effects that flow and iſſue from them, and are cauſed by them, are intended and compriſed, as virtually comprehended and contained in their cauſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where we find one like taught, we muſt conceive alike of all the reſt of like nature; <hi>Quia parium par ratio;</hi> and where there is <hi>par ratio,</hi> there is alſo <hi>par Lex:</hi> where things are like, there the reaſon is alike; and where there is like reaſon, there is alſo like law. And thus not any inſtance can be given, of any point of neceſſary faith or practice, that is not taught by our Saviour in the Scripture. So that we need to go no further, but may content and ſatisfie our ſelves with his teaching.</p>

Apoſtle doth to his hearers, 1 Cor. 11.23. <hi>That which I have received of the Lord, I have delivered unto you.</hi> Only that and no more. And here there are three ſorts faulty; I ſhall but only name them to you, and go on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Superſtitious Teacher; there were a multitude of ſuch not long ago; but bleſſed be the Lord, their number now is well leſſened; whoſe manner was to beat on nothing in the Pulpit but humane Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Inventions and Traditions. They muſt ſtand up at <hi>Gloria Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi> they muſt bow before the Altar, and the like. Theſe were the things that many Preachers dwelt upon, in which their greateſt heat and zeal was ſhewn, as if they were of greater conſequence then Principles and Fundamentals of Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Sceptick Teacher, who doateth about fooliſh idle queſtions, which do not ſerve to edifie, and which when all is done, have neither ground nor reſolution in the Scriptures. And here the Schoolmen were extreamly faulty who have filled the world with multitudes of needleſs and unprofitable ſcruples, and inquiries, concerning which our Saviour (the great Prophet of the Church) ſpeaketh nothing of or on. Such were the points that many of them even ſpent themſelves upon: which many Preachers toſſed and canvaſſed in the Pulpit, by which they ſpoiled the people, as appears by the <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs of thoſe ages which they lived in. And truly there are many in theſe days of ours who ſpend their time and thoughts on idle queſtions, and diſputes about words, and are extreamly vain in their imaginations, and ſo are hindred from ſtudying weighty things, and matters abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The vain-glorious Teacher, who ſtuffes his Sermons to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with nothing elſe almoſt but humane Learning; as if that which Chriſt hath taught us, would not yeild ſufficient matter to deliver to the people. It's true, my Brethren, there may be in preaching, a lawful uſe of ſecular learning, but not a lawful oſtentation of it. Uſe it we may, ſo far as it illuſtrates any thing of Chriſt, and helps us to the clearer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, or better application of it to the hearers. But if we preach our ſelves and not Chriſt, if we lay aſide the perfect and the pretious doctrine which he hath delivered to us, and ſtudy nothing elſe but how to vent our own witt, our own learning, our own fancies; this is dangerous to our ſelves, and pernitious to the people.</p>
               <p>And as the Meſſengers of Chriſt muſt utter what they have received <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from him without addition, ſo without diminution. They muſt fulfill the Word of Chriſt as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25. declare it fully to the people: as Jeſus Chriſt revealed fully what his Father put into his mouth, as we have plentifully ſhewed you: ſo muſt the Meſſengers of Chriſt deliver fully what they have received from him; they muſt not mince it out of fear or favour, or any other baſe end. It was the ſtrict injunction of the Angel to the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> and his fellows, when he ſent them forth to preach, Act. 5.20. <hi>Go, ſtand and ſpeak unto the people all the words of this life.</hi> And Gods immediate precept to the Prophet, Jer. 26.2. <hi>Speak all the words that I command thee, diminiſh
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:46169:144"/>
not a word.</hi> And therefore let not any Meſſenger of Chriſt ſuppreſs and ſmother what he hath received, delivering ſo much as he thinks expedient and no more; ſo much as ſuits with his fancy or with his ends. Let him not upon any grounds, conſiderations, or pretences what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, wrap up any thing in ſilence which Chriſt would have him to make known: But let all his Embaſſadors reſolve with faithful <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,</hi> whatſoever the Lord ſhall put in our mouths, whether it be good or evill, whether the hearers will approve it or diſlike it, that will we ſpeak.</p>
               <p>I ſhall lay down a few Conſiderations, which though they may not ſeem ſo pertinent and proper for this Aſſembly, yet may be of ſome uſe; At leaſt to make you bear with Miniſters the better in their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dealing with you, when you ſee how much it lies upon them to be faithful: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. If they ſuppreſs and ſmother what they have received to deliver, they draw upon themſelves the guilt of blood; yea, of the blood of ſouls; yea, of the ſouls of thoſe whom they are bound to watch for, as thoſe for whom they are to give up an account when the day of reckoning comes. And this appeareth evidently by the Apoſtles proteſtation to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 20.26. <hi>I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of all men.</hi> How ſo? <hi>For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the Counſel of God;</hi> not ſome, but all his Counſel. They that hide any, are not pure from blood; no, not from the blood of ſouls, which is a formidable thing. The blood of bodies hath a voyce, and cryes aloud for wrath and vengeance upon them that ſhed it; The blood of ſouls ſpeaks worſe things, and cryeth louder then that of <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If they ſuppreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they do (in the deſert) deprive themſelves of any ſhare in the mercy of the Lord. It is a dreadful ſentence againſt ſuch, which God himſelf doth not ſeem to ſpeak ſo much as to thunder out againſt them, Apoc. 22.19. <hi>If any man ſhall take away</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from the words of this book;</hi> Well, if he do, what then? <hi>the Lord ſhall take away his part out of the Book of life, and out of the holy City, and from the things that are written in this Book.</hi> If there be any happineſs to be enjoyed in Heaven and in the new Jeruſalem, which is above; if there be any mercy mentioned in the Book of God, in all the pretious promiſes from the beginning of it to the end; if there be any priviledge to have a part in the bleſſed Book of life; the man that takes away one word out of the Book of God (that ſo doth and ſo continues) is utterly cut off from all theſe. He that is able to diminiſh bleſſings, and to bring them down ſo low that nothing of them ſhall remain, will recompenſe them who diminiſh his word, and pay them home in the ſame kind wherein they ſin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they ſuppreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they expoſe themſelves to ignominy and contempt with men. They think perhaps to gratifie and pleaſe, and to be loved and honoured and eſteemed by this means, <hi>viz.</hi> by hiding and concealing that which they imagine will not relliſh with the people. But God will meet with ſuch in this prepoſterous way of theirs, and croſs
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:46169:144"/>
them ſo, that this ſhall make them deſpicable in the eyes of all men. <hi>I have made you</hi> (ſaith the Lord to the unfaithful Prieſts of Iſrael) <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and baſe before all the people.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>becauſe you have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the Law.</hi> Some of it you have delivered, and ſome of it you have concealed, according as your hearers, and the times would bear, you have dealt partially with it. And thus you thought perhaps to get your ſelves eſteem and love among the people. But it is fallen out quite contrary, clean againſt your expectation; For all men look upon you now as ſelf-ſeekers, men-pleaſers, and time-ſervers: and ſo you are become contemptible and baſe by this means. And if you look on thoſe at this day who are partial in the Law, and who apply it only againſt one ſide, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and threaten none but thoſe that are not of their own party, you ſhall find them of no great eſteem among the people.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If they ſuppreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they expoſe themſelves to ſhame, ſo to wrong from men too. They lay themſelves by their unfaithfulneſs the more open to abuſes and injuries and moleſtations from the people: Whereas if they be faithful, they are under Gods protection; <hi>I have made thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord, encouraging the Prophet) <hi>a defenced City, and an Iron pillar and brazen walls againſt the whole Land, againſt the Princes thereof, againſt the Preiſts thereof, and againſt the whole land; and they ſhall fight againſt thee, but they ſhall not prevail;</hi> and what of this? <hi>Therefore gird up thy loins, and ſpeak unto them all that I command thee, Jer.</hi> 1.17. with-hold not any thing for fear that I would have thee to deliver, be bold and confident in my protection. Be not diſmaid at their faces, leaſt I confound thee before them. The Lord hath always taken ſpecial care of them, who have been truſty in the delivery of his meſſage. And hence the Prophet <hi>David</hi> having ſaid, <hi>he ſuffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved even Kings for their ſakes,</hi> diſcovers in the words immediately annexed, who they were that had this ſpecial intereſt in Gods protection. <hi>Touch not mine anointed and do my Prophets no harm,</hi> Pſal. 105.15. And that Prophetical Petition of <hi>Moſes</hi> in behalf of <hi>Levi,</hi> is notable to this purpoſe, Deut. 33.11. <hi>Strike through the loyns of them that riſe againſt him, and of them that hate him, that they riſe no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you ask me how it comes to paſs that notwithſtanding th aſſurances in the Name of God himſelf, ungodly men have riſen and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vailed againſt the faithful Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt, ſometimes to their utter extirpation.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer in a word, It was not that the Lord was careleſs of their peace and welfare, but it was becauſe they had diſpatched the work which God had given them to do, they had <hi>finiſhed their teſtimony,</hi> as the expreſſion is, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 11.7. Or elſe becauſe the Lord fore-ſaw he ſhould receive more honour by their ſuffering then their peace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. And thus far of our Saviours faithfulneſs in the delivering of his Meſſage, from his Father to his people.</p>
               <p>The iſſue and event of this fidelity of his, comes now in order to be handled, and that as I have ſhewed in two reſpects. Firſt with relation
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:46169:145"/>
to the Meſſage, which he brought, <hi>they have received them,</hi> ſaith he, (that is) <hi>the words that I delivered to them in thy Name;</hi> Secondly, then with relation to himſelf the Meſſenger, <hi>they have known ſurely that I came from thee, and have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that here is their good reception of the Meſſage, and their good perſwaſion of the Meſſenger delivered in ſuch plain expreſſions, that they will need no Explication. The only ſeeming difficulty lies in this, how Chriſt as Man and Mediator may be ſaid to have come out from God, ſince in that Nature he was never with him, in regard of his immediate preſence in the heavens. Truly, my Brethren, he came not from him locally, but he came from him Miniſterially; he came not from him in reſpect of place, but he came from him in reſpect of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe he came of his Meſſage, and of his Errand: and ſo our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt explains himſelf by an Exegeſis in the ſucceeding parcel of the verſe, <hi>They have known ſurely that I came out from thee,</hi> that is, they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</p>
               <p>Now both of theſe particulars, importing the good carriage and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour, both with relation to his meſſage, and to himſelf the Meſſenger, may be conſidered two ways. Either in a joynt dependance of both of them on that which goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Or elſe in a particular dependance of one of them, upon the other. If you conſider them and look upon them, in a joynt dependance upon that which goes before. So they are both of them the fruit and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the faithfulneſs of Chriſt. He was exact in the delivery of his meſſage to a word, as he declares himſelf in the fore-going parcel of the verſe, which we have even now diſpatched, and the event was this; That both his Meſſage and himſelf were very well received and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among his hearers; So that here I might lay down this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The faithfulneſs of the Meſſenger of God, in the diſcharge and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Office, is of very great avail, and efficacy to commend his Meſſage, and himſelf unto the people.</head>
                  <p>I ſhall but only touch at this, becauſe though it be a truth, yet it is not a proper and a ſeaſonable truth to be inſiſted on in this Aſſembly: You ſee the iſſue of it in our Saviour here, the chief Meſſenger of God; he was abſolutely faithful in the truſt that was repoſed in him by his Father; and this was that which came of it, and followed it among his hearers. Their good reception of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> meſſage, they received his words. Their good perſwaſion of himſelf the Meſſenger; they knew for certain that be came from God. And where did ever any Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Chriſt, that was faithful in his place, miſs altogether of ſucceſs, and good eſteem among the people? It's true, ſome will diſlike him and oppoſe him, and hate him for his faithfulneſs, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Micaiah.</hi> But the wiſeſt and the beſt will value him, and love him, and reſpect him for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:46169:145"/>
it. There is a ſpecial bleſſing of the Lord on the fidelity of his Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, which is the cauſe and reaſon that they ſeldom fail of doing ſome good, and of finding ſome fruit, and of having ſome regard from thoſe whom they are ſent to. And there is ſomething in their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, when it comes once to be obſerved by the people, to gain their hearts, and to win their good affections and ſubmiſſion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to their preaching. When they are once perſwaded and convinced that their Miniſter is faithful, this hath a mighty operation on them, if they be not very ſtupid and prophane, to make them hear him, and reſpect him, and obey him.</p>
                  <p>So that to give you but a word of Application,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> this points us with the finger to the true and real cauſe, why many that pretend themſelves at leaſt to be the Meſſengers of God, and the Meſſengers of Chriſt, do find no better entertainment with the people. Their perſons are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, their Miniſtry is ſlighted, themſelves and their words are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. What's the reaſon? the people find they are unfaithful, and hence it is that they have no opinion of them, no regard at all to them. And therefore they that would be well eſteemed among their hearers, that would have their Miniſtry find ſome ſucceſs, and fruit and efficacy in them, muſt ſhew all good fidelity in the diſcharge and execution of their Office.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me, How may this be done, and wherein doth this conſiſt? I will ſhew you in a word, and paſs on to another point of Obſervation. The Meſſenger of Jeſus Chriſt, if he will be well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and well-approved, muſt ſhew his faithfulneſs eſpecially two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In an active way he muſt ſhew his faithfulneſs in two reſpects. Firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in a right delivery of his Meſſage, as he receives it from his Maſter; and ſecondly in a delivery of it too for a right end, that is, for his Maſters end, and not his own.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He muſt ſhew it in a right delivery of his Meſſage, juſt as he receives it from his Maſter. He muſt not alter it or change it in the leaſt degree, to make it ſuit with the genius of the times, or the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Superiors, or the corruption of the people. For if they once perceive that he will ſcrue the word to any intereſt, and make it to comply with any humor, though they may like it well enough, whoſe humors and corruptions he complies with, yet they will never like him, nor think the better of him, but the worſe. No, they will look upon him as a man of no fidelity, of no conſcience: and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly will ſuſpect and undervalue any thing that he delivers. Whereas if he deliver what he hath received without fear, without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and will not vary in the leaſt degree, to comply with any man, they muſt take it as it comes, they will ſay of him as <hi>Ahab</hi> of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> 1 King. 22.8. <hi>I hate him, for he propheſies againſt me ſtill;</hi> but yet he is a Prophet of the Lord: he croſſes me and meets with me continually, but yet I muſt confeſs he is an honeſt and a faithful man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he muſt ſhew his faithfulneſs in a right and juſt delivery of his Meſſage, ſo in the ſecond place in a delivery of it too, for right ends;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:46169:146"/>
conceive it, for his Maſters ends and not his own. To advance Chriſts glory, to build up Chriſts Church, to ſave the ſouls of Chriſts people; If we would be well received and entertained, our hearers muſt have no occaſion to diſtruſt, that that which we deliver (though for the matter of it right and ſound) is to ſatisfie our own paſſion, or to promote our own ends.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, not to ſatisfie our own paſſions. They muſt not think that our ſeeming heat and zeal is for our ſelves, and not for Chriſt: and this we muſt be very wary of in the great differences that are on foot at this time. Corruption will be apt enough (if there were nothing elſe) to make us ſharp and bitter againſt thoſe and their opinions, who are it may be violent againſt us; and if they apprehend us ſo, we ſhall never do them good: and therefore we ſhould ſtrive to carry matters ſo, that we may ſatisfie them, and convince them, that we ſpeak nothing out of ſpleen againſt them. And to this end it would be prudence to forbear looſe flings, and bitter girds at them. We muſt in no wiſe betray any truth of Jeſus Chriſt, by our neglecting to appear and ſhew our ſelves for it, who ever ſet themſelves againſt it; But we ſhould rather do it in a way of reaſon and ſolid conviction, then in a way of paſſion and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oppoſition; and in this way undoubtedly we ſhall do Chriſt and it moſt ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our hearers muſt have no occaſion to diſtruſt, that that which we deliver, aimeth at our own reſpects: That we ſeek our ſelves in it; our own honour by vain oſtentation of wiſdom, and eloquence, and ſecular learning; Our own advantage by inſinuation and pleaſing, and flattery, ſo making merchandize of thoſe that hear us, as the Apoſtles phraſe is; we muſt be able to appeal for this as the Apoſtle did, 1 Theſ. 2.3. <hi>Our exhortation was not of deceit or guile; but as we were allowed of God to be put in truſt with the Goſpel, ſo we ſpeak, not as pleaſing men, but God who tries our hearts. For neither at any time uſed we flattering words (as ye know) nor a cloke of covetouſneſs, God is witneſs.</hi> If ſuch a cloke as that be uſed by any that pretends himſelf a meſſenger of Chriſt, a cloke to hide and cover baſe ends, and once the people come to look under that cloke, and to ſee what is within, they will never like him more.</p>
                  <p>And as the Meſſenger of Chriſt, if he would be well received, muſt ſhew his faithfulneſs to Chriſt his Maſter, in an active, ſo in a paſſive way. As in a right delivery of his meſſage both for the matter and the ends of it, ſo in a conſtant and a patient ſuffering for that which he hath ſo delivered, if Chriſt ſhall call him thereunto. In the firſt place he muſt be ſure that that which he delivers is indeed his Maſters meſſage; and then he muſt ſtand to it, even to the loſs of liberty, and goods, and name, and life and all. For if the people ſee him flinch when he is called to this, if they perceive that he will ſuffer nothing for that which he hath preached to them with ſo much earneſtneſs, with ſo much confidence, with ſo much ſeeming reſolution, farewell their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, their eſtimation of him any more. They will ſee he is a hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (as Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch a one) and ſo accordingly they will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:46169:146"/>
of him. <hi>The good and faithful Shepherd,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11. <hi>gives his life for the Sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the ſhepherd of the ſheep, whoſe own the ſheep are not, ſees the wolf coming, and leaveth the ſheep. The hireling flyeth becauſe he is a hireling,</hi> &amp;c. By which it is apparent, that it is the part but of a hireling and a mercenary man, who ſerves for nothing elſe but wages, to fly when trouble and when danger comes. And hence the faithful Meſſengers of Chriſt, have ſealed their teachings with their ſufferings, and their blood, as I might give you many inſtances out of the ſtories of the Scripture and the Church. And therefore they that will preſerve the credit of their Miniſtry, and hold up the power and operation of it with the people, muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly circumſpect that they deliver nothing but what they know to be the truth of Chriſt, for which they muſt rather ſuffer then revoke it; and then they muſt be valiant when the time of trial comes; For if they ſhrink in wetting, they are gone. It will not ſerve the turn to tell the people they were deceived and miſled. For if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly miſtaken once, they will be ready to conclude, they may be ſo a ſecond time, and ſo a third, and ſo a long; and the end of all will be, that they will never give any great credit or eſteem to them, or to their teaching any more.</p>
                  <p>Thus by the way upon the obſervation hinted to us in the joynt dependance of both particulars, conſidered in the Text on that which goes immediately before.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to look upon them in a particular dependance, the one of them upon the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the latter on the former. Firſt you have here their good reception of the meſſage which our Saviour brought, <hi>They received it,</hi> ſaith the Text. And then you have their good perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Meſſenger, that <hi>he came out from God,</hi> was ſent from God; and this perſwaſion, as I take it, was the ground of the reception, and under that reſpect is mentioned here; <hi>They received my words,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; but how came this to paſs? They were perſwaded that I came from God. The point is obvious.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The good reception of the meſſage by the people, depends upon their good opinion of the Meſſenger; their ſure perſwaſion that he is ſent to them from God.</head>

You ſhall obſerve in the Epiſtles, how this is ſet upon the threſholds ſtill, and in the very entrance of them, that ſo the Pen-men of them might anticipate or meet with that in the beginning which would be prejudicial to the ſucceſs and efficacy of their doctrine, and conſequently leave the people free, to benefit by that which was to follow. <hi>Pauls</hi> wiſdom is remarkable in this reſpect; in his Epiſtles you may ſee a taſte of it, Gal. 1.1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle not of men,</hi> nor by men, <hi>q. d.</hi> however the falſe Teachers tell you that I am called by men, as other ordinary Miniſters and Paſtors are, and ſo by conſequence that I have no ſuch Univerſal charge as I pretend, and that I thruſt my ſelf into the right of other men, to ſtand a medling and a tampering as I do with all the Churches: yet I aſſure you, I do nothing elſe but that to which I am deputed and deſigned by my Commiſſion from the Lord; For I am his Apoſtle called immediately by him: and Jeſus Chriſt is very careful to ſatifie and to convince his hearers that he came from God, as I might give you inſtances enough, but they are known. And this both he and the Apoſtles, becauſe they did knew the peoples good reception the meſſage dependeth much, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </label> I might apply this to the Miniſters, but I will rather turn it to the people. Is it ſo, that the good reception of the meſſage by the people dependeth much upon their good opinion of the Meſſenger? Then let it be a Caution to you, that you do not over-lightly entertain an ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who come from God to you. For you your ſelves will be the loſers by it; it will hinder the ſucceſs and efficacy of their teaching: And therefore follow the Apoſtles Counſel, 1 Tim. 5.19. <hi>Againſt an Elder receive not an accuſation, but before two or three witneſſes.</hi> If there be witneſſes ſufficient, and the fault deſerve it, purſue it, follow it.

                  <p>But above all take heed how you drink in the leaſt ſuſpition, whether the Miniſter be ſent of God, or no, without a very ſure ground; for this, if it be entertained, will altogether hinder the good reception of the meſſage which he brings you.</p>

So that if any queſtion grow in this particular, he is able to appeal to all the people, as the Apoſtle ſometimes did, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You know our entrance:</hi> It was not in a clandeſtine and ſurreptitious way; you of the Church, you know it what it was; whether it were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule, and as be ſeems a Miniſter of Chriſt, I leave it to your ſelves to judge, I appeal to your verdict.</p>

gave gifts unto men</hi> for the work of the Miniſtry: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.12. God <hi>makes able Miniſters of the New Teſtament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. As he makes them, ſo he makes them able too, indues them in a meaſure with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of knowledge and utterance; gives them wiſdom and a mouth.

                  <p>You may judge a little as by their ability, ſo by their propenſity to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Office of a Miniſter. And this is that which the Apoſtle calls a ready mind to feed the flock, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.2.

But if he be content to ſpend himſelf and to be ſpent, if he be like <hi>a burning and ſhining light,</hi> as it is ſaid of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> burning in his zealous Doctrine, ſhining in his holy life, and waſting while he ſhines to others; if it be his meat and drink to do the work that God hath put into his hands: ſuch a Miniſter as this, ſo coming in, ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo employed, beware how you ſuſpect that he is not ſent of God.</p>

               <p>WE have not yet diſpatched the Preface, or the preparation to our Saviours Prayer in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; ſome think indeed, that he begins his Prayer for them in the following verſe, which we are now about to enter on, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world:</hi> But if you mark it, there is nothing in it, either of Confeſſion, or Petition, or Thankſgiving; only our Saviour Chriſt lays down ſome leading Conſiderations which induce him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Supplication for them to his Father; And they are taken ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their relation, or from their condition. The firſt is drawn from their relation to his Father and himſelf, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine;</hi> by means whereof it comes to paſs that <hi>I am glorified in them:</hi> the next is drawn from the condition they were in, and were likely to be in, they were at preſent in the world, and they were likely to be in it out of hand without Chriſt; I mean without his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and corporal, and fleſhly preſence; <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but they are in the world, and I come to thee;</hi> as if he ſhould have added, and I muſt leave them behind me; The greater need they had to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by him in his prayers, which were the laſt he was to make with them in this world. Theſe are the things that move him to become an earneſt ſuitor to his Father for his Apoſtles and Diſciples in a ſpecial
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:46169:148"/>
manner, as he hints in the beginning, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this he ſpeaks excluſively, you ſee, as it is very manifeſt, even in the letter of the Text. A man would think it might have been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for our Saviour to have ſaid, <hi>I pray for them.</hi> For had he ſaid but ſo, he had implyed, that other men were not at all remembred, by him in his prayers: But he will be expreſs and clear in ſuch a buſineſs of ſuch high importance; he will ſhut out the world from having any ſhare at all in this incomparable priviledge, in down-right language, and in plain terms from being once ſo much as mentioned in his prayers, <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world.</hi>

                  <p>He prays for them, and none but them; the world are utterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from having ſhare at all in our Saviours Interceſſion. He intercedes for none that are without the pale that he ſets up in this Text; he doth not ſpeak one word to God for them: <hi>I pray not for the world,</hi> ſaith he, I meddle not with them at all in that buſineſs. But if he pray not for the world, who are they for whom he prays? <hi>I pray for them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. For them, for whom? why, for them <hi>whom thou haſt given me.</hi> So that they who are Chriſt's, you ſee, have a peculiar priviledge in this regard; for all the Interceſſion of the Son of God, the great High Prieſt is ſpent upon them; <hi>If any ſin, we have an Advocate with God the Father,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. He ſpeaks it there excluſively, <hi>we have,</hi> and no others. And therefore it is very much to be obſerved, that he ſaith not, If any ſin, he hath an Advocate; for there are many ſinners in the world, that have no Advocate with God the Father. But <hi>if any ſin, we have an Advocate,</hi> we that believe, have Chriſt to intercede for us. And he may have an advocate if he believe; if he be one of us, let the man be what be will, and let his ſin be what it will, Chriſt will be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate and Interceſſor to his Father for him: <hi>He ever lives</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of our Saviour) <hi>to make interceſsion for them,</hi> Heb. 7.25. Them, whom? why them <hi>who come to God by him,</hi> as you may ſee if you reflect upon the former parcel of the verſe; <hi>He is able to ſave them to the utmoſt who come to God by him, ſeeing he ever lives to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion for them:</hi> Still you ſee his interceſſion is confined to a ſelected company of men, and not extended to the whole world. <hi>He appears in Heaven for us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. Not for all without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, but for us whom he hath taken into his ſpecial and peculiar love and care, who are comparatively but a ſmall number.</p>

                     </label> And the reaſon is apparent, becauſe he is a Prieſt for none but them only, and Interceſſion is a part of his Prieſthood. There are two
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:46169:148"/>
branches (as you may know my Brethren) of the Prieſthood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; Sacrifice and Interceſſion; and they are both of them for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He offers Sacrifice for none but them, and ſo accordingly he intercedes for none but them neither; for both the branches of his Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of neceſſity muſt go together.</p>
                  <p>He is a Mediator for, and only for his own people; he makes peace for none but them. And even as he is not a Mediator of redemption for the world; ſo he is not a Mediator of Interceſſion for it neither. Indeed, my Brethren, all that he is, or doth as he is Man and Mediator, is for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Why was the Son of God incarnate but for them? why did he take our Nature on him but for them? why was he made a Mediator but for them? He is a King to rule them, a Prophet to inſtruct them, a Prieſt to ſacrifice and intercede for them. He had never been a King as he is a Man, he had never been a Prophet, he had never been a Prieſt, but for the ſake of his people. And hence it follows very clearly, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he doth in the adminiſtrations of theſe Offices of his, he doth it (next to his own glory) for his Churches good. He carries it throughout in reference to them: and ſo accordingly the Execution of his Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in both the parts and branches of it is for them.

That he ſhould ſpend his blood for thoſe, for whom he will not ſpend his breath? That he ſhould give his life for thoſe, for whom he will not give his word? will he do that which is abundantly the greater for them, and then refuſe to do the leſs? You ſee he ſaith expreſly in my Text, <hi>I pray not for the world.</hi> And might he not have ſaid as well, I dye not for the world? and if our Saviours interceſſion now in heaven be not vocal, as it is uſually reſolved, but a real preſentation of the merits of his death, and the vertue of his paſſion to his Father: That as the blood of Martyrs cries for vengeance to be executed upon thoſe that ſhed it, ſo on the other ſide, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator cries for mercy to be ſhewed to them for whom he ſhed it. It claims it out of right and juſtice in the behalf of thoſe for whom he dyed. Why then, it follows, that if he dyed for all, he cannot chooſe but intercede for all too. Or if he ſhould be ſilent, his blood would cry for mercy for them, to whom it was intended and deſigned; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if he pray not for the world, he dyed not for the world neither.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> thoſe who are without the pale, that are not only in the world, but of the world; Chriſt never intercedes for them, let their cauſe be what it will, let their neceſſity be what it will.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:46169:149"/>
for your ſelves, and all in vain; for Jeſus Chriſt will not ſpeak a word for you, nor any ſuch as you are. Beloved, I beſeech you think upon it, there come in heavy things againſt you every day at the bar of Gods Juſtice. Sin cryes, and the Law cryes, all the Commandements which you break continually come in with open mouth againſt you, and importune Gods Juſtice for wrath and vengeance to be executed on you. They cry How long Lord? and ſin cryes How long Lord? and Chriſt who is the only Mediator to avert wrath, and make peace, he ſitteth ſtill and ſaith nothing. Oh my Beloved, what ſhould hinder now, but that the black decree for execution ſhould go forth againſt you, when there is none to interpoſe and ſtand between you and the wrath of God! when theſe complaints and cryes of all the ſins that you have done, of all the Oathes that you have ſworn, of all the lyes that you have made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> come in againſt you in the Court of heaven: and the Father puts the queſtion to the Son the only advocate in that Court, What have you any thing to ſay for this man, why judgement ſhould not paſs againſt him? will you undertake for him? and Chriſt ſhall anſwer no, I have not a word to ſay for him; I intercede not for the world: Let Juſtice have its courſe againſt him, let it be executed on him to the utmoſt: I pray for my own people, and I deſire they may be ſpared as in right they ought to be, for I have ſatisfied for them. But for the reſt I even leave them to the vengeance and the wrath they have deſerved, I will not hinder it, or ſtop it, in the leaſt degree; Let Juſtice pay them home in full weight and full meaſure; Look how much they have ſinned, and how much wickedneſs they have committed, ſo much torment and ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row let it give them. Oh what a flood of horrour and confuſion, think you, will be poured out upon you, when once the day of vengeance and of viſitation comes; when God comes forth againſt you as an Enemy with nothing elſe but war and death, and blood, and mine, and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his looks, and there is none to pacifie and appeaſe him, none to ſpeak a word for you; but Chriſt the only Mediator leaves you to the utmoſt of his fury, Oh conſider this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

In this reſpect they have a priviledge above the world, that they have him to intercede for them, to be their Advocate, and to preſent their Supplications and requeſts to God. Brethren, I know not how you value it, or what account you make of it, but I aſſure you, it is a rich Prerogative that you have ſuch an Interceſſor with the Father, if you have eyes to ſee the worth of it. And that you may the better know your happineſs in this regard, I ſhall lay it open to you in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Your happineſs is great, that you have Chriſt to be your Interceſſor in this reſpect, that he is ſo near to God, and that he hath ſuch intereſt in God. An intereſt of near union, for he is one with God, the Father; an intereſt of dear affection; he is his Son, his Son that is extreamly like him, his Son that never did offend him, in whom his very ſoul delights, ſo that he can deny him nothing; it is but ask and have; <hi>ask of me, and I will give thee.</hi> And is it not a priviledge to have ſuch as he to ſpeak for
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:46169:149"/>
us? One that can do ſo much with God, that hath his ear and heart too; One that can ſurely carry any buſineſs for us in the Court of Heaven; for his Father hears him always, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.4. and never puts him off with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal. An Advocate that is not favoured; may ſpeak much and plead hard, and yet he may prevail but little. But Jeſus Chriſt is ſure to ſpeed in any ſuit, in any buſineſs that he undertakes. Oh the bleſſedneſs of thoſe who are within the compaſs of this glorious priviledge, and who have ſuch a powerful Advocate as Chriſt is!</p>
                  <p>Your happineſs is very great that you have Chriſt to be your Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in this reſpect that he is near to you. As he is near to God, ſo he is near to you alſo, and ſo by conſequence he is the fitter to be an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate to God for you. It is a very great advantage to us, that he that is to plead our caſe with God the Father, is our near kinſman; He is <hi>Immanuel, God with us,</hi> God one of us, who took not on him Angels, but <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> who is of our own fleſh and blood and bone, and therefore he will certainly be tender of us, and compaſſionate towards us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves that we are very happy in a High Prieſt, <hi>He being ſuch a one as cannot but be touched with our infirmities,</hi> as being of the ſelf ſame nature with us, and having had himſelf experience of them, <hi>for he was in all things like unto us, ſin only excepted;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot but be very much affected with our ſorrows and our ſufferings, and very ſenſible when he is pleading for us to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Our happineſs is great, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this reſpect, that he is not like to dye,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſo to leave the buſineſs that he undertakes imperfect. It is the caſe of other Advocates ſometimes, they drop away in the middle of a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: they follow it and plead it very well a while, but dye before they finiſh it, before they bring it to a Judgement; and then the Clyent knows not what to do, nor to whom to have recourſe; for no man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands his buſineſs; he muſt go back again to the beginning. There is no fear of this in Jeſus Chriſt our Advocate and Interceſſor; we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, he will go through with our buſineſs; he will not leave it till he have brought it to perfection; <hi>He will ſave us to the utmoſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and why ſo? becauſe he <hi>ever lives to make interceſſion for us,</hi> as it is added there in that place.</p>
                  <p>So you ſee our happineſs is great, it is a bleſſed priviledge that we have Chriſt to be our Interceſſor; and it may yeeld us ſingular encouragement, and pretious comfort divers ways: As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may encourage us and comfort us, in our addreſſes to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God. <hi>Now we may go with boldneſs to the Throne of grace,</hi> having ſo good a friend with God as Chriſt is. If we were to goe alone, and of our ſelves, if we had none to make our way for us, it could not chooſe but be a great diſheartning to us. But when we ſeriouſly conſider that our Advocate is there, our friend is there, who will be ready upon all occaſions to ſecond us, to put in a good word for us; to help out us in any buſineſs, this is a ground of choice comfort.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It may ſupport us in the ſenſe of our many imperfections. However our petitions are put up in much infirmity and fear and weakneſs, yet if
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46169:150"/>
they be according to the will of God, we may remember ſtill that they are ſeconded by Chriſt in heaven; That he puts in on our behalf, and demands the ſame things, that he excuſes what is wanting in our prayers, and ſupplies it in his own. We are flat, but he is quick; we are dull, but he is lively; we are ſhort, but he is full.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may aſſure us of ſucceſs in our Petitions, ſince we have Chriſt to intercede for us: We might ſtand begging long enough our ſelves, and never ſpeed. But if we be among the number of thoſe for whom our Saviour undertakes to plead; if he will put in but a word for us, all is ended preſently, and we have a gratious anſwer out of hand. God may deny us, while we are ſpeaking for our ſelves; but if Chriſt ſpeak for us, he can never be denyed; his Father always lets him have his own asking.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This may keep us from deſpair and ſinking under the weight of all our ſins. <hi>If we ſin, we have an Advocate</hi> to plead for us, to anſwer all the accuſations of the Law and of the Conſcience. It is his Office to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe between his Father and his people, to plead the cauſes of our ſouls before him. And this we may take ſpecial comfort in, that be our matters never ſo ſoul, never ſo inexcuſeable as conſidered in themſelves, his very undertaking of them clears all, and ſets us right even at the bar of Gods juſtice. True, their iniquities are black and heynous, ſaith our Advocate; but, are they greater then my merits are? if ſo, let them be condemned; if not, let them be abſolved: If all that I have done and ſuffered will acquit them, let them be acquitted. What cauſe have we to cheer our hearts, and bleſs our God, that we have ſuch an Advocate as Chriſt is!</p>
                  <p>And thus far of our Saviours Declaration.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we now to the Conſiderations that induce him to become a Suitor for them to his Father: Whereof the firſt is taken from the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they had, not to himſelf alone, but to his Father. <hi>I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine, and all mine are thine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the words indeed contain a reaſon of congruity why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhould commend the caſe of his Diſciples and Apoſtles in his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to his Father; becauſe as they were his, ſo they were his Fathers too, and it concerned him to take care of thoſe that were his own, that appertained and belonged to him. As if our Saviour ſhould have ſaid, If they are mine and not thine, I had no ſuch great inducement, or no ſuch great encouragement at leaſt to petition thee for them, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a gratious anſwer and a merciful rerurn from thee in their behalf; But they are thine as well as mine. <hi>I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> True, <hi>thou haſt given them to me,</hi> but ſo, that <hi>they are thine</hi> ſtil. Thou art not utterly deveſted by thy gift, of the right thou hadſt in them, and therefore it is meet and congruous that thou ſhouldſt ſtill continue thy regard to them, and that thou ſhouldſt be flexible to the Petitions that I make for them.</p>
                  <p>Now this he clears a little further yet, that they were his Fathers
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:46169:150"/>
ſtill, though they were beſtowed on him, becauſe all that belonged to him were ſo; <hi>I pray for them whom thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> How ſo? might the Father ſay; if I have given them to thee, how are they mine? Why ſaith our Saviour, all that I have is thine; <hi>all mine are thine,</hi> and conſequently they are thine too, notwithſtanding this donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that the Conjunction <hi>And, they are thine, and all mine are thine,</hi> ſtands for the cauſal particle, as if he ſhould have ſaid, for mine are thine. And ſo we find it often uſed in the Scripture; you may take that place for inſtance, Pſal. 60.11. <hi>Lord, do thou give us help from trouble, and vain is the help of man,</hi> ſo it is the Original; but in our laſt Tranſlation it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the cauſal particle, <hi>for vain is the help of man:</hi> ſo in my Text, <hi>They are thine, and all mine are thine,</hi> that is, for <hi>all mine are thine, q.d.</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt needs be thine, for indeed all mine are ſo, ſo that the point to be obſerved is this:</p>

So that you ſee my Brethren, Chriſt takes off all other ſharers in his people, when once they come to be beſtowed on him, and to be ſeiz'd upon by him: He either buys them out by good purchaſe, or drives them out by plain
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:46169:151"/>
force, and ſo they come to be the Fathers and his own, entirely and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly; ſo that the Father is apparently a gainer by it, his intereſt is greater in them then it was before; for whereas there were many ſharers in his people formerly, now there is none but Chriſt to ſhare with him: He, and be alone is leſt, and all the reſt of the pretenders are caſheered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They are more the Fathers when he hath given them to Jeſus Chriſt, and he accordingly hath ſeiz'd upon them, then they were before he gave them, becauſe his title now is ſtrengthened and enlarged: Indeed before he had a title to them by creation; but now he hath a title to them by Creation and Redemption too: For Chriſt doth not redeem us for himſelf, as diſtinguiſhed from the Father, but as one together with him: His Father gives a people to him for this very end, that he may purchaſe and redeem them not to himſelf alone, but to his Father too; He is the Fathers Miniſter, the Fathers ſervant in this buſineſs, in the great work of Redemption; his Father gives him, and his Father ſeals him, and his Father ſends him; and conſequently what he doth, he doth not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much as he is man, but for his Father; and therefore when his Father hath beſtowed them on him by Election, and he hath bought them by Redemption, his Father is ſo far from being outed of his right, that now he hath a better title to them, then he had before: Now he can ſay, not only as he could before, <hi>they are mine;</hi> for I have received them: but more then ſo, <hi>they are mine;</hi> for my own Son hath bought them, and brought them back again for me, when I had loſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They are more the Fathers when he hath given them to Jeſus Chriſt, and he accordingly hath ſeized upon them, then they were before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe now they are one with him: Before they did in ſome reſpect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed belong to him, but now they are one with him; they are not only one with Chriſt, but they are one with God the Father too, in, and by, and through Chriſt; for being joyned to Chriſt who is one with God the Father, they cannot but be joyned to him whom Jeſus Chriſt is joyned to; and hence our Saviour ſpeaking to his Father of his people, ſaith he, <hi>they are one in us,</hi> Joh. 17.21. not one among themſelves alone, but <hi>one in us;</hi> not in me only, but in thee too: So that when God beſtows a people on our Saviour, he brings them nearer to him then they were before: He doth not only make them his, but he makes them one with him; and an intereſt of union, is far beyond an intereſt of meer poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>So that yee ſee the point is cleer, The people of the Lord Chriſt do belong to God the Father; and that the more becauſe they are beſtowed upon him by the Father. The Fathers intereſt is ſo far from being weakned and abated <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And why ſo? <hi>For I have ſevered you from other people, that you ſhould be mine:</hi> And ſo ſay I to you, my Brethren, you are the Lords own people, and he hath ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you from others to be his peculiar ones. Oh ſee now that you walk as it becometh thoſe to do, who are the Lords, and that upon theſe two grounds: For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The ſins of thoſe who are his own, reflect with more diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him then the ſins of others do. He ſuffers not ſo much in the exorbitancies of other men that appertain not to him, as he doth in yours, and therefore you ſhould be the more wary. Oh let not wicked men have any cauſe to ſay of you, as the Heathen did ſometimes of the people of the Jews, the only people of the Lord at that time, Ezek. 36.20. <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord, and they are gone out of his Land.</hi> They carried and demeaned themſelves ſo ill, that he could not bear with them, but he was fain to caſt them forth out of the Land which he had beſtowed upon them: So let not wicked wretches ſay of you, <hi>Theſe are the people of the Lord,</hi> and yet they are proud, covetous, worldly, wanton, looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let not his name I pray you be diſhonored and blaſphemed by your means; but think when you are tempted and enticed to any ſin, Whether it be fit for thoſe who are the Lords own people, to do ſuch wickedneſs and ſin againſt their God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As your iniquities who are the Lords, diſhonour him more, ſo he will chaſten you, if you miſcarry, ſooner and quicker then he will do other men who are further off from him: &amp; this ſhould make you yet more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:46169:152"/>
that known place is home and appoſite to this purpoſe, Amos 3.12. <hi>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you:</hi> For other families that are not mine, as you are, and that appertain not to me in ſuch a ſpecial manner as you do, I ſhall not be ſo quick to exerciſe my Diſcipline upon them. But you are mine own houſhold, and therefore if you do amiſs, I will be ſure to take a courſe with you. If God ſee many Aliens to him, doing any wickedneſs, he may bear with them long, for it concerns him not ſo much to deal againſt them; but if he ſpy out any of his own amongſt them, doing as the reſt do, he will be ſure to ſingle him and call him out from all the reſt, and ſay, You are my own, you appertain eſpecially to me; and what, will you do as theſe vile abominable wretches do? will you run out with them to the ſame exceſs of riot? Come I muſt order you, though I let the reſt alone, I muſt not ſuffer you in ſuch courſes.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that all people of the Lord Chriſt do belong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then is pretious comfort for the Saints ariſing from the property and intereſt that God the Father hath in them. For it they be his own, and that in ſuch a ſpecial and peculiar way, as we have ſhewed, we may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he will do very much for them, and that in divers caſes; I will name a few of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If they be his own, the Father certainly will hear the Son for them; he will be eaſily entreated for thoſe that have ſuch near relation to him: If they were only Chriſts, and not his, this were enough to make him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, to the Interceſſion that his own Son makes for them, becauſe they appertain to one that is ſo infinitely dear to him: But ſeeing they are Chriſts and his too, this carries all before it; and this is that our Saviour urges in my Text, That thoſe for whom he prayed and interceded, did aſwell belong to his Father as himſelf: ſo that his Father was as much engaged to hear as he was to pray for them; <hi>I pray for them whom thou haſt given me, for they are thine; q. d.</hi> I hope thou wilt not put me off with a denyal; <hi>For they are thine as well as mine,</hi> whom I intercede for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If they belong to God the Father, we may depend upon it, he doth love them, and love them very dearly too, as thoſe that are ſo near to him: Property and intereſt is one ſpecial ground of love; we uſe to love our own, you know, yea many times to dote upon them out of meaſure, though there be nothing lovely in them. And certainly the Lord hath very dear affections to his own too; though they be black, yet they are comely in his eyes: His love towards them is ſo great, that it covers many faults, and many blemiſhes and ſpots in them: and the cauſe of all is this, the near and ſpecial intereſt he hath in them; this makes his love without meaſure and without end, Joh. 13.1. <hi>Having loved his own to the end he loves them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If they belong to God the Father, he will be very tender of their wrongs; and this he will diſcover one of thoſe two ways, either he will defend them, or avenge them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt if he ſee it fit, he will defend them, and protect them from the wrongs of thoſe that ſeek to be abuſive and injurious to them: They are his own, and therefore he will certainly take care of them. Beloved,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:46169:152"/>
theſe are times of ſome danger, and it is good to have a ſure and ſafe keeper. And verily they that belong to God are in a very good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what ever alterations come upon the world; how ever matters go, he will be careful of his own; he will not be ſo ill a Maſter to abandon them to ruine, when they have moſt need of him: Or</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if he defend them not from wrong, (as he may leave his own ſometimes in the hands of wicked men, for cauſes which he beſt knows,) certainly he will avenge them: The property and intereſt he hath in them, will engage him to appear on their ſide, to take their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel into his hands, and to render wrath to thoſe that are abuſive and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to them. Eſpecially if they make complaint to him, and if they cry becauſe of the oppreſſion, they are ſo near and dear to him, that he cannot chooſe but right them; <hi>Will he not avenge his own, when they cry day and night to him,</hi> Luk. 18.7. As who ſhould ſay, Do you make a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it? it is impoſſible but he ſhould do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If they belong to God, he will provide for them: Will he not find his people meat and drink, and clothes, and other things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for them? Doth he keep ſo ill an houſe, to let his Family lack bread? Oh do not ſo diſhonour him, to have ſuch poor and low thoughts of him; it's that which troubles many that belong to God, of the meaner ſort of people, they are afraid that they ſhall want; their charge encreaſes and their Trade decays, and poverty begins to come upon them like an armed man, and now their hearts are quite down; they doubt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will not find them bread. <hi>Oh you of little faith, wherefore do you doubt?</hi> Why do you ſo diſtruſt God? <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> You are his who is the Lord of all the Earth, and all the fulneſs of proviſion that is in it. He feeds his enemies, and will he ſee his own want? Truly my Brethren, if you have not ſuch provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as you would deſire, it is becauſe he ſees it beſt to dyet you, and knows that fulneſs and plenty of external things would not in any caſe be beſt for you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If they belong to God, he will not loſe them; what do you think the Lord will be ſo wretchleſs that he will not keep his own? No, no, he bought them at ſo dear a rate, that he will know how he forgoes them: His they are and he will keep them; and however ſin and Satan and the world are alwayes plucking at them, to get them (if it might be poſſible) away from God, he will hold them faſt enough, that none ſhall pluck them out of his hand.</p>

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:46169:153"/>
that depends on this, and flows from this, the neer relation which they had to him, to Chriſt himſelf; <hi>All mine are thine,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to his Father, <hi>and thine are mine.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Since they are mine, I am glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them.</hi> And this addes ſtrength to the Conſideration upon which it is inferred, and hath ſomething in it farther to move our Saviour to be mindful of his Apoſtles and Diſciples in his prayers, becauſe as they were his own, ſo he was glorified in them. Many times we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured in thoſe that are our own, and that have near relation to us, more then we are, yea more then we can be in thoſe that are further off from us. Chriſt is not ſo in thoſe that appertain to him; no, he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in them: The more inclinable he is to tender them in his petitions to his Father; <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou haſt given me; for they are thine, and mine are thine, and thine are mine, and I am glorified in them.</hi>

                  <p>If they be his, he is glorified in them even as the Teacher is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in the Scholar, as the Maſter is glorified in the ſervant, or as the head is glorified in the members, ſo Chriſt is glorified in his people; he is the great Prophet, the great Teacher of his Church, and if his people learn well, if they thrive and grow in knowledge, it is a Commendation to their Teacher; he is the Lord and Maſter of his people, and if his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants do well, it is an honour to their Maſter: He is the head of his Church which is his body; and if his members thrive well, if they have any beauty in them, it is a commendation to their Head; Indeed, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if they were the Scholars of another Maſter, the ſervants of another Lord, the members of another head, their proficiency and tractability, and beauty, were nothing to the Lord Chriſt.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:46169:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lord Chriſt, that he hath ſuch people, ſo qualified, and ſo imployed: when they believe in difficult and hard caſes, they glorifie him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20. <hi>He was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to God:</hi> when they are fruitful in the works of righteouſneſs, theſe are alſo to the praiſe of his glory: Herein is he glorified, if they bring forth much fruit: For Jeſus Chriſt is looked upon as the Original of all the good, the Fountain and the Spring of all the holineſs that is in his people. And hence the praiſe of all returns to him, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, Rom. 11. <hi>ult. For of him are all things.</hi> And what follows? <hi>To him be glory for ever, Amen.</hi> If any of his people have a ſpecial gift of knowledge, they have learned it all of Chriſt: if they excel in other grace, they receive it all from Chriſt. If they have any choice ability to any holy and religious duty, it is Chriſt that makes them able, and it is Chriſt that ſtrengthens them. They that have judgements exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and are able to diſcern aſſoon as they diſcover any excellency in any kind in any of the Saints, they aſcribe it all to Chriſt, becauſe they know they had it all from him: See what Jeſus Chriſt can do in, and for, and by thoſe that have Originally nothing that is good in them. If any of them ſhine, the beams that make them gliſter, come from Chriſt, and they dart back to Chriſt again: He ſhines upon them, and he ſhines in them, as the Prophet inſinuates, Iſai. 60.1. <hi>Ariſe and ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> It is a glory to the Lord Chriſt that he hath ſuch a beautiful and glorious people. And thus you ſee, my Brethren, he is glorified in the grace of thoſe that belong to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As he is glorified in the grace, ſo he is glorified and ſhall be glorified in the glory of thoſe that belong to him: eſpecially in the great day, when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.10. to be glorified in them to wonder and to admiration. So that the world ſhall be aſtoniſhed and amazed to ſee the matchleſs and unutterable glory that he ſhall adorn them with, and in their glory glorifie himſelf. This ſhall tranſport beholders into wonder, it ſhall make them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them, and to admire Chriſt in them.</p>
                  <p>Its true, Chriſt ſhall be glorified wonderfully on that day in the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deſtruction of the wicked that belong not to him. The wrath of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be an admirable wrath; the judgements and the vengeance that he ſhall inflict upon them ſhall be full of wonder; that men ſhall be aſtoniſhed and amazed to ſee, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi> who in this life hath ſhewed himſelf ſo meek and patient, and long-ſuffering to abominable ſinners, ſhould be ſo out of meaſure wrath with them. Ungodly men themſelves will wonder at his fury. The Saints will wonder at his glorious juſtice, and adore the righteouſneſs of his proceedings with all the wicked unbelievers of the world. Yea, their confuſion and deſtruction in that great and dreadfull day will be one ſpecial part of that admirable glory, whereby Chriſt will be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull in the eyes of all his people. Becauſe for their ſakes, and the wrongs and injuries that wicked men have offered them, ſhall their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

be the heavier, and the deeper, and that to all eternity. Oh what an admirable thing is this (will the poor people of the Lord ſay) that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſuch dear reſpect to us, that he ſhould be ſo angry with poor creatures and execute ſuch heavy wrath upon them for our ſakes!</p>
                  <p>But there will be incomparably greater cauſe of glorifying Jeſus Chriſt, and of wondering at his mercy in the ſalvation of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For alas the wicked ſhall have nothing elſe but their deſerts in that day. But this ſhall be the height of wonder that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould load his people with ſuch an Hyperbolical and tranſcendent weight of glory without the leaſt deſert on their part, yea when they have deſerved the ſame extremity of vengeance that is inflicted on the wicked. Oh what a glory muſt this be to Jeſus Chriſt? how ſhall this fill the mouths of all the Angels and triumphant Saints in heaven with his praiſes? How ſhall his people wonder at their own glory, and at the glory of their fellow-Saints, and the tranſcendent love of Chriſt in it! How ſhall the great ones of the earth that have contemned and trampled under foot the poor deſpiſed Servants of the Lord Chriſt, ſtand amazed at their glory, beyond all that they looked for! Oh my beloved, how wonderfull ſhall Jeſus Chriſt be in that day to all the world, in the incomparable glory which then he will beſtow upon his poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and deſpiſed people!</p>

Is it nothing for the Lord to ſhake a perſon off, to ſay unto him in diſpleaſure, Sir, tell me not of any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt you have in me, for you belong not to me; I will not acknowledge you, I tell you plainly you are none of mine. Truly my brethren, however it may ſeem at preſent, the day will come when this will be a ſad ſentence. When men in the great day of ſeparation ſhall ſtrive to make a title to the Lord Chriſt, when they ſhall tell him, Lord, we have been acquainted with thee heretofore (as they did in the Parable) we
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:46169:154"/>
have born thy name, and we have been called Chriſtians, and have been accounted thine, and wilt thou not acknowledge us and own us now? And Chriſt ſhall anſwer them, <hi>depart from me, I know you not,</hi> go, get you over on the other ſide among the Goats, I tell you, you are none of mine. Ah my beloved, this will be a cooling and a killing word indeed.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt is glorified in all thoſe that belong to him?<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Both in their grace and holineſs in this world, and in their glory in the world to come? This then ſhould be a motive and inducement to us to ſtrive and labour after both theſe, both after grace in this world, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the world to come, both to be holy here, and happy hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This ſhould quicken us and ſtirr us up to labour after holineſs and grace, that Jeſus Chriſt may be glorified in us. If grace were only advantagious to our ſelves and honorable to our ſelves (as to be really and truly gracious, is indeed the greateſt honour in the world) there were no ſuch reaſon then why we ſhould labour to attain it, and abound with it. For then you know we could have no higher aim then only to ſet up a poor Creature. But ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt is honoured in the grace and holineſs, and the obedience of his people, Oh how ſhould this enflame us with reſtleſs and unſatisfied deſires of theſe things! How ſhould we covet and covet earneſtly the beſt gifts, and labour that we may excell in inward grace and outward obedience, that we may ſet up Jeſus Chriſt the more, and that his honour may be the more advanced by us. When we are ſeeking to the Lord for holineſs and grace that he would give it out to us, and give it more abundantly, how ſhould we preſs and quicken our petitions with this prevailing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Jeſus Chriſt will be advanced by it, and his glory more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged. Lord, give us more faith, love, hope, patience, zeal, power againſt corruption, ſtrength to new obedience, that Chriſt may have the more glory. We ſeek not theſe things to promote our own eſteem and reputation, and that we may be ſome body among the Saints, but that Chriſt Jeſus may be all in all. It is thy great deſign to glorifie thy Son Chriſt, and this is the ready way to accompliſh the deſign on which thy very heart is ſet; if thou give us more holineſs and more grace, he will have more glory. Thou wilt not honour us ſo much, but Jeſus Chriſt thine own beloved Son will be glorified in us. And therefore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee ſet thy Treaſure open to us, and give us out a large ſhare. In ſuch a manner the Apoſtle deals with God in his petitions, in that memorable place to this purpoſe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11, 12. <hi>We pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>that God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs, and the work of faith with power.</hi> That he would carry on that work of grace upon your ſouls, till he hath brought it to perfection. And why ſo? to what end? <hi>That the name of our Lord Jeſus may be glorified in you;</hi> not that you may be honoured; but that Chriſt <hi>may be glorified in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as this ſhould ſtirr us up to labour after grace in this world, ſo after glory in the world to come; Since Chriſt is glorified as in the grace, ſo much more in the glory of his people; For glory is compleat grace,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46169:155"/>
and therefore Chriſt is glorified in that to admiration, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you formerly in explication of the point. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome <hi>who ſeek glory. Rom.</hi> 2.7. he means the glory of the other world, as it is very evident by that which is joyned with it, glory, and honour and immortality and Eternal life. And truly it is not unlawfull for every one of us to ſeek glory, I mean our own eternal glory in the heavens, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe while we ſeek that, we ſeek the glory of Chriſt in it.</p>
                  <p>Its that which troubles many of the Saints, they think that they are ſcarce upright becauſe they have ſo great an eye upon their own glory. They doubt their own ſincerity, meerly upon this ground. Indeed, my brethren, if your own glory and ſalvation went ſingle and alone, it were a greater cauſe of ſcruple. But ſince the glory of the Lord Chriſt, is comprehended and involved in it, why ſhould you not deſire and ſeek it, as ſubſervient to the great and high end? And therefore I beſeech you my beloved, under this notion have reſpect to it, and draw encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement and ſweetneſs from it, amidſt the many heavy labours and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufferings of this preſent life. Look up man to the glory that is ſet before thee, preſs hard towards it, be diligent and patient in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of it, ſtrive and labour to obtain it: while thou conſidereſt with thy ſelf that when thou art glorified, Chriſt will be glorified in thee. And ſo in aiming at thy own glory do thou intend and ſeek the glory of Chriſt. And this is that which thou maiſt do, yea, this is that which thou muſt do. And therefore go on cheerfully, embrace the promiſe that is yet afar of, reach at the Crown of glory that is hung out to tempt thee and to toll thee on; And let this animate thee moſt of all, that when thou haſt attained it, Chriſt will be glorified and admired in thee. He whom thy very ſoul loveth, will have one monument the more of his own praiſe and glory unto all eternity. And thus far of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that induced our Saviour to become a Suitor for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples to his Father, <hi>viz.</hi> the neer relation which they had to his Father and himſelf, by means of which it came to paſs that he was glorified in them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond follows now in order, to be handled, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were likely to be in, by reaſon of the near approach of his departure from them to the Father, and leaving them behind in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and malitious world. <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world, and I come to thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A dolefull and heart-killing word, you muſt conceive, it was to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>and now I am no more in the world.</hi> They who left all for him, muſt needs be very much dejected to be left by him. And to be left alone in ſuch a wilderneſs in ſuch a troubleſome, unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and a vexatious place, as the world hath alwayes been to Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. As long as he was with them, he was a very great ſupport, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and comfort to them in all conditions and in all caſes. And therefore now he is about to leave them, he thinks it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to commend them to the eſpecial care and mercy and protection of his Father.</p>
                  <p>There are two things ſuggeſted in this dying Song, this laſt farewell
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46169:155"/>
of our Saviour in my Text; his own departure, and his Diſciples ſtay behinde him. His own departure; <hi>and now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee;</hi> his Diſciples ſtay behinde him: <hi>but theſe are in the world,</hi> and are to continue ſo, for that is intimated in the words. Chriſt muſt go, and they muſt ſtay, ſo that a dolefull ſeparation is at hand. If Chriſt had been to have remained among them here, or if he would have taken them up with himſelf into the other world, it had been well, they had been together ſtill. But Chriſt is now about to go, and they muſt not go with him.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the firſt particular ſuggeſted in the words, the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Saviour, <hi>and now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee.</hi> And here you have the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> the term from which he goes, and that is from this lower World: <hi>Now I am no more in the world.</hi> And the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> the term to which he goes, to the preſence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>but I come to thee. I am no more in this world,</hi> this lower world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath Heaven. He ſpeaks of that which is approaching and at hand, as if it were already acted and accompliſhed; for it is evident he was in this world, when he uttered theſe words. And it is uſual with the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture to ſpeak of inſtant things as done already. And ſo our Saviour in my Text, <hi>I am no more in this world,</hi> q. d. I am as good as gone already, the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
                  <p>Now this our Saviour doth not here affirm of himſelf as he is God, for ſo he doth not, neither can he go or come. He filleth every place at once, and conſequently cannot move (in that reſpect) from place to place. But he ſpeaks it of himſelf as he is man, and in relation to his bodily and fleſhly preſence: So he is now to be no more in this world, he is to leave it, and depart from it.</p>
                  <p>But whether is he then to go, if he do not tarry here? Why to his Father, as you have it in the following words, <hi>I come to thee.</hi> Why, was he abſent from his Father here? Was there a diſtance between his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and himſelf while he remained in this World? Was not the Father preſent with him everywhere? Yes he was in his Fathers preſence every where, but not in his immediate preſence, where he reveals and ſhews himſelf in the fulneſs of his glory, that is confined to the heaven of the bleſſed. And thither is our Saviour now about to go, to the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate preſence of his Father, as accordingly he did in a ſhort time after; <hi>I am no more in the world, but I come to thee.</hi> So that the Point to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved is this.</p>

Thither is our Saviour gone to the immediate preſence, and to the right hand of the Father: And there are witneſſes enough of this; <hi>while they beheld,</hi> ſaith the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. that is the Apoſtles aſſembled together, as you may ſee in the foregoing part of the Chapter: <hi>While they beheld he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> And that muſt be as he was man, in which reſpect alone he was in ſight, before he was withdrawn from them. And after, <hi>Stephen ſaw the heaven opened, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7.56. He ſaw Jeſus Chriſt there in his Humanity, and as he is the Son of man. And there he muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his humane Nature, until he come again to Judgement, as the Apoſtles were certified by the Angels as ſoon as he was taken from them, Acts 1.11. <hi>Why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? this ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as you have ſeen him going into heaven.</hi> And this is that which the Apoſtle intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in his Sermon to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.20, 21. <hi>He ſhall ſend Jeſus whom the heaven muſt receive until the time of reſtitution of all things.</hi> Indeed, my Brethren, Chriſt was once manifeſted in the fleſh, appeared in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the World, but now he is departed hence, <hi>and received up to glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. So that the point is plain you ſee, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt as he is man, is gone out of this lower,</hi> &amp;c. But wherefore did he not continue here? Why did he leave this lower World? Let us ſee the reaſons of it, and they are many, and of great importance; ſome of them concern himſelf, and ſome of them concern his Church; we will ſurvey them in their order.</p>

This World you know, was the place of his abaſure and humiliation, in which he was to be emptied of his glory, and to be made of no reputation. And ſo accordingly he was deſpiſed, and ſlighted, and ſcornfully entreated here. The other world, my Brethren, was the place in which he was to have his recompence for theſe abaſures, and to be glorified after all the ſhame, and ignominy, and contempt which the world had poured upon him: And therefore when he had been throughly humbled here, it was expedient for him to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up to glory, to be tranſlated to the immediate preſence of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where his tranſcendent exaltation was to be. And this he intimates in his Petition, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now O Father, glorifie me with thy ſelf,</hi> q.d.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Jeſus Chriſt as he is man is gone, &amp;c. becauſe he hath no more to do here. He came into the world about buſineſs, and that buſineſs he hath ended and diſpatched, and why then ſhould he tarry in it any longer?
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:46169:156"/>
This world is not ſuch a place, in which one would be willing to continue longer then he hath work to do in it. Indeed as long as Jeſus Chriſt had any buſineſs to diſpatch he was very well contented to ſtay here. But aſſoon as that was ended, he was deſirous to be gone, and to return to him that ſent him: And therefore this he urgeth very hard, when he enrreats his Father to receive him to him ſelf; <hi>I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do,</hi> Joh. 17.4 <hi>q. d.</hi> If I had not done the work for which thou haſt diſpatched me down into this lower world, I ſhould be willing to continue here: But I have gone through with it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, I have made an end of it, ſo that I have no more to do in this world, and therefore I beſeech thee let me come away to thee.</p>
                  <p>Jeſus Chriſt as he is man is gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe as he hath no more to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> do here, ſo he hath very much to do there, and therefore is gone thither, where his buſineſs lies: He is called his Fathers ſervant very often in the Scripture; And truly my Brethren, he is a diligent and faithful one: aſſoon as he hath done his work in one place, away goes he unto another, he doth not love to ſtay and idle there where he hath no work to do, but where his buſineſs and employment is, there is the place that he deſires to be. And hence it is my Brethren, that he went away into the other world, becauſe he had much work to do there. But you will ask me what that work was? I anſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was to triumph there over his Enemies and ours: This was a neceſſary and important buſineſs, and it was not to be done compleatly here in this world, at leaſt not till and in the very act of his departure; and this is that which the Apoſtle pointeth at, Epheſ. 4.8. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led Captivity captive;</hi> He did it not before, or after, but in that article of time, <hi>when he aſcended,</hi> when he returned to his own Countrey, then he led his Captives with him: Even as thoſe Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of old among the <hi>Romans,</hi> when they returned back to <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſome glorious victory, were wont to bring their Captives with them which they had taken in the wars, and to lead them by their Chariots in a victorious and triumphant way. So Jeſus Chriſt when he had conquered Sin, and Death, and Hell, and was returning out of this world to the immediate preſence of his Father, to the Country whence he came, he did it in a glorious and triumphant way: He did not ſteal away out of the world, as if he had aſhamed of that which he had done or ſuffered there, as if he had been overcome; No, he went away triumphing, as one that having abſolutely conquered and beaten all that ſtood againſt him, brings along his priſoners with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt is gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he might ſend down his Spirit to his people: That was another work he had to do, the Spirit was not to come down, till he came up; and therefore he aſcended, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might deſcend abundantly upon his people. And this is that of which he mindeth his Apoſtles and Diſciples when he was about to leave them, Joh. 16.7. <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> and why ſo? <hi>For if I do not go away, the Comforter, the Holy Spirit will not come.</hi> While I am with you in the fleſh, you are ſo taken up with carnal and fleſhly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of me, that you are made incapable of great degrees &amp; meaſures
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:46169:157"/>
of the Spirit. <hi>And therefore I muſt even go away from you, that I may ſend the Spirit to you.</hi> And ſo accordingly he did, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> takes notice, Pſal. 68.18. <hi>He aſcended upon high, and he received gifts for men</hi> (gifts to beſtow on men) <hi>that the Lord God might dwell among them.</hi> A ſtrange expreſſion, he aſcended from them to this end, that he might remain and dwell among them. Yes he aſcended from them in his body, that he might dwell among them by his Spirit, or by thoſe gifts which he received for men, in the preceding words. Well then, you ſee he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from us, not to forſake us, but to dwell among us. He hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the preſence of his Body, that he might dwell among us by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Spirit, According to that ſweet and pretious promiſe made to his Diſciples, when he was ready to depart from them, Mat. 20.28. <hi>Behold I am with you always, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he might intercede for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Why you will tell me ſo he might, and ſo he did, while he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in this world, he offered up ſtrong cries to God, and that not for himſelf alone, but for his Church, and members too. Yea, the Chapter we are handling is the Prayer of our Saviour in the behalf of his people; ſo that he might have interceded for them by vocal ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, had he remained ſtill in this world, and had he never gone hence. Yea, but he could not then have interceded for them by perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as he doth now. And therefore he is gone to heaven, that he may appear in the preſence of God for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. And is it not a comfort to us to conſider that we have ſuch a choiſe and pretious friend there? That we have ſuch an Advocate in Court continually at all times and in all cauſes? That he is always by his Father in his Body and his humane Nature, wherein he ſuffered for his people? You know he bare our ſins in his body on the tree, and in that crucified body, he appeareth in the preſence of his Father. So that he is at hand on all occaſions, to ſhew his Father all his wounds and all his ſcars, all the prints, and all the marks of his bitter bloody ſufferings. Oh Father, may he ſay, (when there is any thing in agitation for his people, any ſupplication for them, or any accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation laid againſt them) remember what I have endured for them in this fleſh of mine, what I have ſuffered for them, in this body here before thee, look upon theſe wounds and ſcars, and for my ſake be grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them: do not deny them their Petitions, do not reject them for their unallowed and bewailed imperfections.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Jeſus Chriſt is gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to make heaven ready for us, that ſo we may be preſently admitted when we come. And this our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, who beſt knows, yeelds as the reaſon of his departure from his Apoſtles and Diſciples; when he was about to leave them, ſaith he, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> Joh. 14.2. when our Saviour Chriſt entred heaven, and paſſed into the immediate preſence of his Father, he took poſſeſſion of it in our name and ſtead, and left it open after him to all his Members. He hath in this reſpect prepared it for us, that he hath made it ready to receive us; And when we are ready too, he will come and receive us to himſelf, that where he is, there may we be alſo, as it is added in the fore-alleadged place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.3.</p>

                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:46169:157"/>5. Jeſus Chriſt is gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that in the mean time till he take us up to him to heaven perſonally, he may draw us up to heaven virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. That till we follow him in perſon, we may follow him in heart and in affection, that may ſet them on the things that are above, where Chriſt alſo fits on the right hand of God. If Chriſt were ſtill among us in the body, and in a viſible and fleſhly way, you are not able to imagine how much it would detain us here. We ſhould not care much to look higher then the place where Chriſt is. But now he is departed from us into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this draws up our affections after him, who is ſo infinitely dear &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to us; <hi>for where the treaſure is there will the heart be alſo.</hi> This makes us to deſire with the Apoſtle to be with him, <hi>to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt:</hi> This makes us keep him company, though at a diſtance: It makes us heavenly in our diſcourſes, meditations, converſations, as the Apoſtle was, Phil. 3.30. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

If they ſay he is in the Deſert, go not forth; he is in the ſecret chambers, believe it not,</hi> as Chriſt addes in that place. If a ſeducing ſpirit tell you, Chriſt is in ſuch, or ſuch a place, ſuch or ſuch a one is Chriſt (as ſome have been ſo groſsly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent in theſe times) believe him not. If a Papiſt, or Ubiquitary tell you, Lo here is Chriſt, lo, he is corporally preſent in the Sacrament, the bread is really and truly chang'd into his body, believe him not. No, my Beloved, do you depend on that which Chriſt himſelf, affirmeth in my Text, <hi>and now I am no more in the world,</hi> as to my bodily and fleſhly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence untill you ſee him come again, as the Apoſtles ſaw him go

away (for every eye ſhall ſee him when he comes) be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he is not here in this world, I ſay as Chriſt in the fore-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged place, <hi>Take heed, I have foretold you.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt as he is man is gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that he hath withdrawn his corporal and fleſhly preſence from us? Then let us make the more of the preſence of his Spirit by which he is ſtill among us: If he be abſent from us one way, it is good reaſon that we ſhould the more improve his preſence with us in another. The chief comfort of the ſoul conſiſteth in Communion with the Lord Chriſt, in having fellowſhip with him. Now Chriſt, as he is man, is aſcended into heaven, and ſo in that reſpect he is no more in the world. We cannot yet go up to him, though we would gladly die and be diſſolved, that we might be with Chriſt, yet it cannot yet be. But which way then ſhall we enjoy Communion with him? Why, my Beloved, becauſe we are not able to go up to him, the Spirit will do ſo much for us, that he will bring him down to us; and thus though he be abſent from us in the body, yet he is preſent with us in the Spirit, and will be to the worlds end, according to his own promiſe, Matth. 28.20. <hi>Lo I am with you always to the end of the world;</hi> They are the laſt words of the Chapter, and the laſt words of the Book, and there is nothing added, but <hi>Amen,</hi> Let it be ſo: and ſure it is a ſweet cloſe. Well then, my Brethren, let our work and buſineſs be to conſider with our ſelves, how we may the more enjoy him in the Spirit, becauſe we can no longer now enjoy him in the body. How we may make the moſt of that we have. And I ſhall give you the beſt adviſe that I am able, in this great buſineſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If you deſire to make the moſt of the preſence of your Saviour in the Spirit now he is abſent from you in the body, you muſt be infinitely cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, that you do not grieve that Spirit by which he is preſent with you: If you grieve and trouble him, he will withdraw and hide himſelf from you, and then Chriſt is wholly gone both in the Body and the Spirit too; you do not ſenſibly enjoy him neither one way nor the other, and ſo are in a very ſad caſe. Since the preſence of the Spirit is all that you enjoy of Chriſt; ſo that if he be gone, my Brethren, all is gone, you muſt be very wary that you do not vex the Spirit, and cauſe him to depart from you.</p>
               <p>But you will ask me, Which way do we vex and grieve the Spirit? we would know it, that ſo we might be careful to avoid it. I might ſpeak much of this Subject, and draw out my diſcourſe into abundance of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; but I will ſay it in a word; you grieve the Spirit when you deal unkindly with him any away. This is the ſpecal thing that grieves friends, when one of them deals unkindely with another; and ſo it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit and the ſoul; He comes to us from Chriſt, in much love and much kindneſs to ſupply his abſence from us, and we are unkind to him, and this grieves him out of meaſure; Now we are unkind to him eſpecially two ways, and that is either when we ſlight him, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we ſlight him, this is a very great unkindneſs, and that which friends can very ill bear. He makes tenders of himſelf, and we take
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46169:158"/>
no notice of him; he ſtands knocking at our doors, or rather Jeſus Chriſt by him, and we let him knock ſtill; He would be entertained by us, and we will not entertain him; or if we do, it is in ſuch a careleſs, and in ſuch a ſlight way, as if he were not worthy to be looked upon: The evil ſpirit comes, and he hath all the welcome that the houſe can make, he finds it ſwept and garniſhed; the Holy Spirit comes, and he is ſet behind doors. He offers holy motions to us, he ſtirs us up to read, to pray, to humble and afflict our ſouls, to meditate of holy things, and we neglect them, as if they were not worth the hearkning to. He offers ſweet and pretious comforts to us, and we forſake our own mercy; we hanker after other pleaſures and delights; the comforts of the Spirit will not rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with us, our ſouls loath this light bread; we muſt have fleſhly ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and refreſhments, ſpiritual will not ſerve the turn: Brethren, this is no good uſage, the Holy Spirit grieves at this; He thinks (as well he may) he hath deſerved better at our hands then this is: I have brought down Chriſt to them, and ſo have comforted and cheered them (thinks he) and now they ſlight and grieve me.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And as we deal unkindly with him when we ſlight him, ſo we deal more unkindly with him, when we oppoſe him and reſiſt him, when we ſet our ſelves againſt him; I know the Spirit of grace is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible in ſome reſpect, but yet <hi>ad luctam,</hi> he may be reſiſted, though he cannot <hi>ad victoriam;</hi> and ſo he is ſometimes even by the Lords own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Even they have fleſh within them, that luſts againſt this Spirit,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks; That doth not ſlight it, and neglect it only, but luſt againſt it. The Spirit will have this or that done: no ſaith the fleſh, it ſhall not, the Spirit ſhall not be obeyed; the Spirit will have ſuch a luſt caſt out that is always croſſing him, and thwarting with him. No ſaith the fleſh, it ſhall not goe. The Spirit would have us ſet about ſuch or ſuch a holy duty; the fleſh oppoſes and reſiſts the motion; and we are well content (it may be) at preſent that it ſhould do ſo, and ſo we ſit ſtill and let all alone, ſay the Spirit what he will. Brethren, the Spirit takes it very ill to be thus uſed by us; it makes him ſad, that theſe whom he hath done ſo much for, ſhould make him ſuch a recompence, and that he ſhould be wounded thus in the houſe of his friends: That they ſhould keep and favour fellows there, and make them houſhold-gueſts, that go to thruſt him out of doors when he comes to lodge with them. I beſeech you think upon it, and give him better entertainment, that ſo he may take pleaſure to be with you.</p>
               <p>If you deſire to make the moſt of the preſence of your Saviour in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Spirit, now he is abſent from you in the body; as you muſt not grieve him, ſo you muſt take ſingular and extraordinary comfort in him; for he is ſent down as a Comforter (you know) in Chriſts abſence; and therefore this is the ſpecial uſe that you are to make of him. It is ſad that Chriſt is gone; but it is comfortable that the Spirit is come down from heaven to ſupply his place, and therefore let us ſee that we take comfort in it. Ah, my Beloved, is not this a ſweet and welcome Office of the Spirit to repreſent Chriſt to us, and ſo pretious and ſo ſweet a friend as Chriſt is? when he comes in and tells us, Chriſt is gone up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:46169:159"/>
to heaven, and he will fetch you after him ere it be long, <hi>that where he is, there may you be alſo.</hi> And in the mean time he hath taken care of you, and he hath ſent me down of purpoſe to be inſtead of him to you; and he would have you look upon me, as if he himſelf were with you. Ah, my Beloved, ſhould not our hearts even leap within us, at ſuch news as this? Doth not the Spirit comfort us? ſhould it not be a raviſhing, and a reviving thing to us, when he comes in Chriſts ſtead, and ſupplies Chriſts room, and Chriſts place?</p>
               <p>Doth not our Saviour Chriſt himſelf propound it oftentimes to his Apoſtles and Diſciples for their comfort, when they were in heavineſs, and when their hearts were even about to break within them? come be not troubled, that I am about to leave you, <hi>I will ſend you another Comforter that ſhall abide with you for ever,</hi> Joh. 14.16. I have been a comfort to you I confeſs, but <hi>I will ſend you another Comforter,</hi> one that ſhall comfort you as much as I have done, and one that ſhall ſtick to you, and ſhall not leave you (as I am about to do) but ſhall abide with you for ever; <hi>I will not leave you comfortleſs,</hi> as Chriſt adds in the 18. verſe. No, which way will you help it might they ſay? How can we but be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs when Chriſt is gone? why, this way I will help it, might our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſay, I will come to you, and be with you by my Spirit: And though the world can never ſee me while my body is withdrawn, and I am only preſent with you by my Spirit, yet you have eyes to ſee me preſent with you this way; and while you have this preſence with you, I hope you have no reaſon to complain that you are left without comfort: So that the Spirit is a comforter you ſee by repreſenting Chriſt to us; yea, it is a greater comfort that the Spirit is with us, then if Chriſt himſelf were with us: It is a greater comfort that Chriſt is preſent with us by his Spirit, then if he ſhould be preſent with us by his body; then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort were more narrow, but now it is more large; then the comfort were more outward, but now it is more inward; then the comfort were more fleſhly; but now it is more ſpiritual, and therefore let us take in this comfort.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If you deſire to make the moſt of the preſence of your Saviour in the Spirit, now he is abſent from you in the body, as you muſt take in the comforts, ſo you muſt take in the graces of the Spirit; for even as Chriſt is preſent with you by the comforts, ſo he is preſent with you by the graces of the Spirit: By theſe he dwells among us, though he be in heaven in the body, as the Pſalmiſt intimates, Pſal. 68.18. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he received gifts for men,</hi> the gifts and graces of the Spirit to beſtow on men, <hi>that the Lord God might dwell among them,</hi> by thoſe gifts and thoſe graces: And therefore the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that Chriſt might dwell in their hearts by faith, one of the principal of thoſe graces, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. Well then, my Brethren, when Jeſus Chriſt makes tenders of himſelf to you, by theſe graces, let him come in and dwell with you. Make the more of this way of his reſidence and habitation with you, becauſe you cannot have him in the other. When he offers any grace, conſider with your ſelves, Now Jeſus Chriſt draws nigh to me, he that is above in heaven, and with relation to his
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46169:159"/>
bodily and fleſhly preſence is no more in this world, is in another way coming into my ſoul; And therefore do not ſhut the doors againſt him, but bid him very welcome when he comes; when he offers more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, love, hope, patience, let not theſe offers be refuſed: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when you take in theſe, you take in Chriſt with them, in the preſence of his Spirit: So much as you enjoy of theſe, ſo much you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy of Chriſt; and therefore ſeek and value every ſaving grace the more, and be the readier to receive and entertain it, becauſe it brings Chriſt with it.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo, that Jeſus Chriſt as he is man is gone away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then let us <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> alſo go away out of the world to him, that we may be where he is; I ſay as Chriſt to his Diſciples in another caſe, <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is gone, you hear, and why then do we ſtay behind him? why do we tarry here, when Chriſt is gone? It's true, we cannot go to him in the body; but yet as Chriſt though he be abſent from us in the body, yet he is preſent with us by his Spirit: ſo we upon the other ſide, though we be abſent from him in the body, let us be preſent with him in the Spirit; and as he comes from heaven to us by his Spirit, though his body ſtay there; ſo let us go from earth to heaven to our Saviour in our ſpirits, though our bodies ſtay here.</p>
               <p>But you will ask me, <hi>How may this be done, or how may we be preſent with our Saviour in our Spirits?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer;</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may be preſent with him in the thoughts and meditations of the Spirit. Theſe are the proper actings of the ſoul, the inner man; and if our thoughts be much upon him, we are in this reſpect much with him. And therefore I beſeech you, my Beloved, let us feed our ſelves continually with ſweet and pretious thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt; though we be here below, and muſt continue ſo till Chriſt be pleaſed to take us to himſelf, yet let our minds aſcend to heaven, and let our thoughts and meditations be where Chriſt is. Oh let us think upon him in the day and in the night; upon our beds when we are ſtill, and have nothing to diſtract us; then let our hearts be filled with ſweet ſoliloquies, with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing and tranſporting thoughts of Chriſt, that we may ſpeak to him as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 104.34. <hi>How pretious are the thoughts of thee, O Lord?</hi> How great is the ſum of them? It paſſes my Arithmetique to caſt them up.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be preſent with our Saviour in the affections of the Spirit; let our ſpirits cleave to him, though we be abſent from him in the body: Where Jeſus Chriſt our treaſure is, there let our hearts be alſo. That as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to <hi>Gehazi</hi> once, <hi>Went not my heart with thee?</hi> when at that very time he was ſitting in his houſe, and <hi>Gehazi</hi> was abroad, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.26. So we may ſay to Jeſus Chriſt, though in another way; However we be abſent from thee in the body, yet is not our heart with thee? as the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians, We Brethren, being taken from you in preſence, not in heart,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.17. ſo we to Jeſus Chriſt; Oh Lord, though we be ſeparated from thee in our bodies, we are not ſeparated from thee in our hearts; They are continually with thee, nor ſhall they be divided from thee.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:46169:160"/>3. Let us be preſent with our Saviour in the deſires and anhelations of the Spirit; let them be always mounting up where he is; he is gone, and in the mean time till he come again to us, let us long to go to him. Oh let us build no Tabernacles on the <hi>Tabor</hi> of this world, ſince our Saviour is not here: But let us look upon our ſelves as baniſhed men, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.6, and ſo let us groan earneſtly to get to Chriſt as he did. Let us be always breathing, gaſping, fainting after Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and putting out our heads to ſee when he will come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us to himſelf, that where he is, there may we be alſo. And thus far of the firſt particular ſuggeſted in the words, the departure of our Saviour out of this lower world to the immediate preſence of his Father; <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but I come to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, and that is, his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples ſtay behind him; <hi>But theſe are in the world,</hi> and are where they are like to be, and where they are to tarry and remain when I am gone.</p>
               <p>The world in which our Saviour Chriſts Apoſtles and Diſciples were, and were to ſtay, muſt be conceived to be the very ſame which Chriſt himſelf was now about to leave, and from which he was ready to depart, <hi>viz.</hi> this lower world beneath heaven; that from which he was to go, in that were his Diſciples and Apoſtles to remain. <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but theſe are in the world,</hi> the ſelf ſame world in which I am to be no more.</p>
               <p>But why is this alleadged by our Saviour to his Father here, that the Apoſtles and Diſciples were to ſtay in this world? apparently to ſhew what cauſe he had to mention them in his Petitions, and to commend them to the ſpecial care and mercy and protection of his Father. As in the words that are immediately annexed, <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own Name. q. d.</hi> I am even now about to leave them, and to leave them in the world, and thou knoweſt what a place the world is, how trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, unpleaſing, and vexatious it hath continually been to my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and therefore I beſeech thee, Father, keep them, have a ſpecial eye upon them who are to ſtay behind me in ſuch a place as this is.</p>
               <p>So that the point apparently ſuggeſted here is this;</p>

Though they be in the world, yet they are not of the world, and therefore they are hated by the world, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf informeth his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love its own, but becauſe ye are not of the world, therefore the world hates you.</hi> And hence it comes to paſs that it perſues them, perſecutes them, caſts them out, creates them all the trouble and vexation that it can: ſo that they are not like to have a quiet hour almoſt in this world. Beſides the evils and afflictions to which they are expoſed by the neceſſity of nature, <hi>as man is born to trouble as the ſparks fly upwards, Job</hi> 5.7. diſtempers and diſeaſes in their bodies, loſs of their eſtates and friends and earthly comforts and the like, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men come in with their additions. The Church of Chriſt while ſhe is here, is ill-ſeated, ſhe grows in an ill place, as he himſelf affirmeth of her, 2 <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. <hi>as the Lilly among thorns, ſo is my Love among the daughters.</hi> She is environed and begirt with them, ſo that ſhe is annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hurt and pierct on every ſide.

This is the ſtate and the condition of the Saints while they are here, they are continually vexed and troubled: So that no marvel though our Saviour tells his own Apoſtles, <hi>In the world you ſhall have tribulation. Iohn</hi> 16.33. That is your portion, as long as you remain here.</p>
                  <p>The world hath alwayes been an evil and uncomfortable place to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſts Diſciples, in this reſpect, that it is a place of ſinning. Indeed, my brethren, they are troubled with the ſins of other men, their righteous ſouls are vexed with their filthy converſations. Rivers of waters run down their eyes becauſe men keep not Gods Law. But they are chiefly troubled with their own ſins, from which they are not to be wholly freed, while they remain in this world; As long as they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue here, they are perpetually in Sathans danger, who is the Prince of this world, and whoſe authority and power is confined to this life. There will never be an abſolute and perfect cure of ſin in any of the Saints, till this corruption have put on incorruption: And hence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the corruptions of our natures are ſtiled <hi>worldly luſts, Tit.</hi> 2.12. And our members that are upon the earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. becauſe we cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be rid of them, while we are here upon the earth, and while we live in this world. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> compares himſelf and others of the Saints, to earthen Veſſels, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. And earthen veſſels when they were legally defiled, could not be made clean again, till they were broken all in pieces, as you may ſee <hi>Lev.</hi> 11.33. So we, my brethen, are not to be fully cleanſed, till we be ſhivered all in pieces. We are not to be wholly reſcued from the bondage to corruption, till death tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is to another world. And then <hi>he that is dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, is <hi>free from ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.7. So that no marvel though the world be a place
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:46169:161"/>
of ſuch diſquiet and diſcomfort to the Saints; For how can they be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfortable here, while they are alwayes ſinning againſt God. <hi>He that hath entred into reſt indeed hath ceaſed from his own works,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.10. Till then he cannot wholly ceaſe from thoſe that are moſt properly his own works, but is in danger of offending God and falling into ſin continually, and ſo can have no reſt here.</p>
                  <p>Nay, my beloved, no man knows how far the Lord may ſuffer him to fall in this world. Though it be a certain truth that they that are elect, can never wholly fall away from God, yet they may ſin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, to the diſhonour of the Lord, the ſcandal of their brethren, and the irreparable wounding of their name, while they have a day to live. And this they are in danger of, I mean of falling fearfully, ſo long as they remain here. What deadly falls have many of Gods worthies taken in their latter times! It is obſervable that <hi>Davids</hi> firſt wayes are commended 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.3. By which the Holy Ghoſt inſinuates that his laſt wayes were not anſwerable to them. <hi>He</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Jehoſaphat) walked in the firſt wayes of his Father David.</hi> Indeed the latter wayes of <hi>David</hi> were blemiſhed with extremity of ſin and ſcandal.

And how then can the world but but be a doleful and uncomfortable place to Chriſts Diſciples, where they are in ſuch hazard? How can they but complain as <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſometimes did, though in another caſe, If I muſt ſtill be troubled with my luſts, and my corruptions, if I muſt ſtill be over-ruled by them thus, what good will continuance in the world do me?</p>

content, to promiſe great and extraodinary matters to our ſelves; To ſing a <hi>requiem</hi> to our ſouls, with the rich man in the Goſpel, <hi>take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry.</hi> Its true, the men of this world may have ſome content and quietneſs and ſatisfaction here. They have their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, and they receive their good things here. But as for Chriſts Diſciples, they muſt look for no ſuch matter; And therefore he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warns them when he is about to leave them what they are like to meet with in this world, perſecutions, tribulations and afflictions, all the injury, and wrong, and malice, and deſpight, and evil uſage that the world can pour upon them. <hi>There remaineth a reſt to the people of God, Heb.</hi> 4.9. their reſt remaineth for them, it is not to be had in this world.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it ſhall be their wiſdom to provide for trouble, and not to look the world ſhould be a better place to them, then it hath been to Chriſts Diſciples that have gone before them. Oh my beloved, do not deceive your ſelves in this particular, do not conceive the world will ever yield you any great content or quietneſs, or ſatisfaction; for this is that which makes affliction bitter when it comes. But when you live at greateſt eaſe, when you enjoy the greateſt calm, when all things look as if you were confirmed and ſetled in a proſperous ſtate, as if your Mountain ſhould not be removed, be ſure that you provide your ſelves for worſe times, that ſo afflictions may not find you unprepared when they come. How often ſhall you hear it from the mouths of many, when any heavy croſs is come upon them, Alas they never dreamt of this, they never looked to ſee this dolefull and unhappy day! the weaker and unwiſer they. Did they not know that they are here abiding in a vale of tears, and that the world hath alwayes been an evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable place? And why ſhould they expect it ſhould be better to them then it hath been to others of the Saints, who have perhaps exceeded them in holineſs and grace? And therefore in the midſt of comfort and proſperity, let us be wiſely caſting on the day of trouble and diſtreſs. Let us not reckon upon much felicity and ſweetneſs here, for certainly it is not to be had in this world.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that the world hath alwayes been and is an evil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> if we find it ſo, let it not ſeem ſtrange to us. Let us not look upon it as a thing to be admired or wondred at, if we meet with nothing elſe but tribulation and affliction, and vexations in the world, if we have very little quiet or content here. Let not the members of the Church think much of it, if they be alwayes troubled and diſtreſſed, if they be alwayes followed and purſued with one affliction or another, ſo that they cannot have a comfortable hour almoſt; but let them look upon it as an uſual thing. The world hath alwayes been ſuch an uncomfortable place to Chriſts Diſciples; And therefore let them ſeriouſly conſider, that they could expect no other living in ſuch a place as they do; but this I do but glance at in my paſſage by.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that the world hath alwayes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then ſhould Chriſts <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Diſciples be ſo much in love with this world? and why ſhould any of them be ſo deſirous to continue in it as they are? It is the caſe of many
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46169:162"/>
that do indeed belong to Jeſus Chriſt, they have a great unwillingneſs to leave the world. O what a cutting thing it is to many of them to think of comming forth out of their earthly tabernacles! it is a burthen to them that they cannot bear. They ſay with <hi>Peter, it is good to be here,</hi> though their Saviour be not here, whereas they ſhould ſay with <hi>Paul, It is better to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt.</hi> Though Chriſt himſelf make mention of it as a ſad and dolefull thing, that his Diſciples were to ſtay in this world, they look upon it as a dolefull thing that they are to remove from it. And this it ſeems was <hi>Hazekias</hi> caſe, when he heard that he muſt dye, <hi>he turned to the wall and wept ſore, yea he chatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like a Swallow, and mourned like a Dove.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning <hi>Peter</hi> of his death, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.18. tells him, <hi>he ſhould be carried where he would not.</hi> By which it is apparent, that even in the bleſſed Martyrs there may be a lothneſs to depart out of theſe earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles. Though the righteous ſoul of <hi>Lot</hi> were vexed every day, as long as he remained in <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet Oh how did he linger when the Lord would take him thence! <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.16. Even ſo the Saints of God, though while they live in the <hi>Sodom</hi> of this world, they have a ſorry habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, being continually vexed with the ſins and with the perſecutions of ungodly men; yet are they not ſo unwilling to depart and leave the world as they have cauſe to be. When <hi>Cyrus</hi> made a Proclamation to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that whoſoever was diſpoſed might return out of the Land of his Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, it is obſerved notwithſtanding that none were willing to go out but thoſe whoſe Spirits God had raiſed up to go. So though this world be nothing but a <hi>Babylon</hi> to us, the Land of our Captivity, an evil and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now I beſeech you my beloved, you that have ſenſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, look about you; What do you ſee in this world, why you ſhould be loth to leave it? There is great reaſon why you ſhould be weary of it, why you ſhould look upon it as a ſad thing that you muſt yet continue in a place where you muſt alwayes ſin and ſuffer; there is no avoiding of it. But there is no ſuch reaſon why you ſhould be ſo unwilling to depart out of it.</p>

               <p>AND thus of the tranſition to our Saviours ſupplication in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, conſiſting of a heap of grand conſiderations that induced him to become a ſuitor for them to his Father.</p>
               <p>Proceed we now to enter on the prayer which he makes for them. And here I ſhall take notice only of theſe two things; The object of it, and the parts of it.</p>
               <p>The object of it, or the perſon whom he preſents it to, is mentioned by his title, and his attribute. His title here, you ſee, is <hi>Father,</hi> and his attribute is <hi>holy. Holy Father;</hi> The ſweeteſt title, and the choiceſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute. As for the firſt of theſe, the title that begins the object of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication here, is <hi>Father.</hi> So he ſtiles him in the entrance of his Prayer, and the ſame phraſe he uſes all along, as you ſhall ſee if you ſurvey it, from the beginning to the end. Indeed he gives him once the attribute of <hi>holy,</hi> as you have it in my Text and once the attribute of <hi>righteous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> at the 25. verſe. But this is ſtill the appellation that he uſes, and from whence he never varies. If he call him any thing, he calls him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> And in this notion he Conſiders him while he is putting up his prayer to him. And therefore this you ſee, my Brethren, is the firſt word that he uſes when he ſets himſelf to pray. Thus he begins his prayer for himſelf in the firſt verſe of the Chapter, <hi>Father, glorifie thy Son:</hi> And thus alſo he begins his prayer in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples in my Text, <hi>Father, keep them through thy own Name:</hi> So that you ſee our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our looks upon him as a Father ſtill, when he is pouring out his prayer to him, either for himſelf, or others. And this would yeild us matter of very good conſideration, but that it hath been very largely handled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. And therefore I ſhall paſs on from the title <hi>Father,</hi> unto the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute our Saviour gives him here, and that is <hi>holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wherefore doth our Saviour mention this rather then any other
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:46169:163"/>
attribute of God, on this occaſion why might he not have ſaid aſwell Almighty, or Eternal, or Merciful, or Gratious Father? the ſpecial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he chooſes this Expreſſion (as far as I conceive) cannot be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undoubtedly reſolved. Indeed he prays for holineſs for his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples afterwards, and therefore it was congruous he ſhould ſeek it of his Father under the notion of a holy God, who is holy in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and who is alſo the hallower and ſanctifier of his people. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there are divers other things in his Petitions, this doth not ſeem of weight enough to bind him up to this Expreſſion. Once, this is clear and manifeſt that he picks out this attribute of God among the reſt; and whereas many other lay before him, he fixes upon this only; He comes to God in Prayer by the name of <hi>Holy Father.</hi> The thing is evident, though the particular conſideration that induced him to it, be unknown. So that this obſervation we may ſafely pitch upon.</p>

                  <p>The point you ſee, hath two branches. Firſt, God is holy in himſelf; Then Jeſus Chriſt came to him as a holy God, and looked upon him as a holy God, when he was making his Petitions to him. I ſhall purſue them in their order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God is holy in himſelf; ſo he is ſtiled in my Text, you ſee, and that by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who, of all others in the world, is beſt acquainted with his nature, for he came forth out of the boſom of the Father. Indeed it is the attribute that he delighteth in, and therefore he is called the <hi>Holy One</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, very often in the Scripture, to ſhew that he excells in this regard; ſo that however there be many others that are holy in a meaſure, yet he is the <hi>Holy One;</hi> there is not one ſo holy as he is; And he is known in the Old Teſtament by the name of the <hi>Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> which is aſcribed to him more then thirty times. The Seraphims which ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Throne, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.3. cryed out three times a row, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And ſo accordingly the Beaſts that ſtand about the Throne, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 4.8. reſt not day and night, ſaying, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty.</hi> To ſhew that God tranſcends in holineſs, he is ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this regard; for ſo <hi>thrice holy</hi> in ſome Languages is moſt holy. To ſay the truth, this is the attribute that makes him glorious; <hi>He is great in power, fearful in praiſes,</hi> but he is <hi>glorious in holineſs,</hi> Exod. 15.11. In this reſpect he is a None-ſuch; none to be compared with him, none like him, not among men only, but among the Gods too. <hi>Who is like to thee O Lord, among the gods, glorious in holineſs, fearful in praiſes, doing wonders!</hi> And hence he glories in his holineſs, and ſwears by it. Even as the great men of the world are wont to ſwear upon their honor, becauſe it is eſteemed among them the moſt ſacred and inviolable thing: So God you ſee, my Brethren, ſwears by his holineſs, Pſal. 29.35. <hi>Once
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:46169:163"/>
have I ſworn by my holineſs,</hi> ſaith God: Once for all, and by my holineſs, having no better or more pretious thing to ſwear by. Let me no longer be eſteemed a holy God, and that I would be very loth, then I inviolably <hi>keep the Covenant that I have made to</hi> David <hi>in my truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that you ſee the former member of the point is firm, God is holy in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond branch, that Jeſus Chriſt came to him as a holy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God, and looked upon him as a holy God when he was making his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, you ſee it evidently in the Text, this is the appellation that he gives him, <hi>Holy Father;</hi> His thoughts are taken up it ſeems, more with the holineſs of God, then any other of his attributes, while he is pouring out his prayers to him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not undertake to ſhew why he did ſo, he had his reaſons in his own breaſt, and in his own boſom. Only this is probable, that he did it that he might be an Example, and a preſident to us, that we might learn of him to do as he did; That when we are approaching to the Throne of Grace we might be very much poſſeſſed with deep and ſerious contemplations of the holineſs of God. I ſhall adde no more for proof, but haſten to the Application.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, that even as God is holy in himſelf, ſo Jeſus Chriſt came <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> to him as a holy God, and looked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then let us learn of Jeſus Chriſt, how to behave our ſelves when we are making our addreſſes to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, and pouring out prayers to him. We are exhorted very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scripture to be followers of Chriſt, and ſo to walk and act as we have him for an Example. In all his imitable ways and actions, his practice ought to be a rule to us. And therefore let us labour to conform our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt in this particular, when we are drawing nigh to God in prayer, let our thoughts be taken up with meditations of his holineſs, let them work much upon this attribute of his. Indeed the Saints of the Old Teſtament, when they ſet God upon his Throne, and clothe him with his Majeſty and glory, (as they uſe to do in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their prayers) do ſeem to take more notice of other attributes of God, of his power, of his dreadfulneſs, his righteouſneſs, his faithfulneſs, his truth, his mercy, then his holineſs. But under the New Teſtament you know, God hath been ſerved &amp; worſhipped in a more ſpiritual way, and here we have the High Prieſt of our profeſſion Jeſus Chriſt, the moſt unparalleld and matchleſs pattern teaching us by his example, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our thoughts upon the holineſs of God, when we are making our approaches to him: And therefore when at any time we ſet our ſelves to pray, let us endevour to affect our ſelves, and to be taken up with deep conſiderations of this attribute of his.</p>
                  <p>Let our moſt working apprehenſions fix upon his holineſs, and make a deep impreſſion of it in our hearts, that we may carry it along throughout, from the beginning of our ſupplications to the end. It will be ſingularly uſeful to us as I ſhall ſhew you in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will help exceedingly to frame our hearts to put them into ſuch a
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:46169:164"/>
poſture as the Lord delights in. It's true, the meditation of other of the attributes of God, hath its work upon our ſpirits when we are draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh unto him: But this, me thinks, hath ſomewhat proper and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to it ſelf further and beyond the reſt. It's true, the apprehenſion of the Mercy of the Lord will make us to have comfortable cheerful hearts; the apprehenſion of his truth and faithfulneſs will make us to have bold couragious hearts; the apprehenſion of his power and greatneſs will make us to have trembling and awful hearts: But now the apprehenſion of his holineſs, will make us to have holy hearts, that ſo we may be like him whom we are making our addreſſes to: And holineſs alone compriſes all that hath been ſaid, and much more; our cheerfulneſs, our confidence, our reverence in prayer, are all but parts of holineſs: A holy frame of heart involves and comprehendeth in it all this, and more beſides then we are able to expreſs. Indeed what ever God takes pleaſure in, as to the temper of his people when they are pouring out their prayers to him, is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under holineſs: Let them come with holy hearts, and all is well; and this they ſhall the better do, if they conſider with what an infinitely holy God they have to do. Oh, this will raiſe the heart if it be duly weighed, to ſuch a ſweet and pretious frame, that it will be no longer earthly, it will be fit to have Communion with the holy God: And therefore <hi>David</hi> preſſes the Conſideration of this attribute of God, in thoſe whom he exhorts to worſhip him, by way of preparation to that great buſineſs, Pſal. 99.9. <hi>Exalt the Lord our God, and worſhip at his holy hill, for the Lord our God is holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The meditation of the holineſs of God, will quicken us, and ſtir us up as far as it is poſſible, to cleanſe our ſelves from every ſin when we are making our approaches to him. For ſin, my Brethren, is againſt his holineſs, yea in directeſt oppoſition: And therefore it is known by the name of filthineſs and uncleanneſs in the Scripture. Not only whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and adultery, and fornication, and ſins of that kind are unclean, as they are called uncleanneſs in the abſtract, but ſin is generally ſo, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. And hence it is, my Brethren, that it is ſo odious to the Lord, there being nothing in the world ſo contrary and ſo oppoſite to him and to his Nature, as ſin is: No man in the world hates any thing, no mans heart abhors, and loaths, and riſes againſt any thing, as the Lords againſt ſin: By reaſon of his pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and his holineſs, he cannot brook it, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. he is not able to endure it: He ſeems, me thinks, to ſhut his eyes, and to cry out to his people, Oh do not this abominable thing which I hate: And therefore when men will not hold, but commit it, the infinitely holy God is vexed and troubled out of all meaſure; ſo he is repreſented in the Scripture, Iſa. 63.10. <hi>They rebelled againſt him,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and they vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> Becauſe he was ſo holy, he was vext the more at ſin, which was ſo filthy.</p>
                  <p>And truly, my Beloved, if we did ſeriouſly conſider the holineſs of God when we are about to pray, we would not dare to bring this filthy thing into his preſence, which is ſo contrary to this attribute of his, and conſequently is ſo odious and deteſtable to him. At leaſt we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:46169:164"/>
to the utmoſt of our power to cleanſe our ſelves from all the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, to waſh our hands and hearts in Innocency (with holy <hi>David</hi>) and ſo to compaſs Gods Atar, to offer up the Incenſe of our prayers to him. Oh we would ſhake and quiver every joint to think of coming to the Holy God, in the midſt of our pollutions, unpurged and unhumbled for. We would conſider with our ſelves, What will the Lord ſay to me when he ſees me in his preſence, ſo defiled? How will he look on ſuch a filthy and abominable wretch as I am? how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but he ſhould hide his eyes from me, when he perceives the hands that I ſpread forth before him are ſo full of gore and blood? how can he chooſe but loath me and abhor me? Do I expect to find favour in his eyes, and come before him with that which he ſo abhors, as if I meant to vex him and provoke him? And therefore if we ever look to ſpeed with God in prayer, let us conſider what a holy God he is, and let us labour to be holy too. Let us be ſeparate from the remainder of the world (as he himſelf adviſes us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17.) and <hi>touch no unclean thing,</hi> and then we have his promiſe, that he will receive us.</p>
                  <p>The meditation of the holineſs of God, as it will be very uſefull to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare us, and to make us fit for prayer, ſo it will be very helpfull to us, in the parts of prayer, and that both in confeſſion, and petition, and thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It will help to humble us in the confeſſion of our ſins. While we conſider that they are ſo filthy and unclean: and God upon the other ſide, whom we confeſs them to, ſo holy. This cannot chooſe (if it be duely weighed) but ſhame us wonderfully in the preſence of the Lord, that we have been, and are ſo filthy before ſuch an holy God. Indeed we ought to be aſhamed to commit iniquity, being ſuch an odious thing. The Lord hath planted ſhame in man, to be a bridle as it were to check him, to curb him, and to hold him in from ſinfull courſes. But if we have not been aſhamed in the commiſſion, we ought eſpecially to be aſhamed in the confeſſion, as God adviſes <hi>Iſrael, Be aſhamed and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your own wayes.</hi> Ezek. 36.2. To review our ſins with ſhame, and to cry out as <hi>Daniel</hi> doth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.8. <hi>to us belongeth confuſion, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Ezra</hi> in his ſad confeſſion, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.6. <hi>Oh my God, I bluſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and am aſhamed to lift up my face to thee.</hi> We ſhould <hi>remember our evil wayes and our doings that are not good, and loath our ſelves for our abominations,</hi> Ezek. 36.30. we ſhould remember and be confounded, and never open our mouths any more becauſe of our ſhame. We ſhould <hi>caſt aſhes on our heads, and rent our hearts, and cry unclean unclean,</hi> Lev. 13.45. And there is no one thing that will confound and ſhame us more then the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the matchleſs purity and holineſs of God, whom by our ſins we h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. As it will humble us in the confeſſion of our ſins, ſo it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage us in our petitions for the cure of ſin. As it will make us low in our confeſſions, ſo it will make us high in our petitions. For how is ſin, which is uncleanneſs removed and cured in any of us, but by holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And is it not a comfort to us when we are making our requeſts
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:46169:165"/>
for holineſs, that we are praying to the Holy God? who is holy in himſelf, and who is the original of all the holineſs that is communicated to the Creature, who is the Sanctifier of his people. Is it not comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that when we come to draw, that we are at the Well-head? If you obſerve, it is the great petition that our Saviour hath to make in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, verſe 17. <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth,</hi> and this he proſecutes throughout. And therefore he begins his prayer for them, <hi>Holy Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It will enlarge us in our thankſgivings to the Lord for holineſs, when we conſider whence it came, and by whom it was beſtowed. We ſhall ſee what cauſe we have to praiſe the Lord, the Donor and Diſpenſer of it: As <hi>David</hi> intimateth in that memorable place to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.12. <hi>Rejoice in the Lord, ye righteous,</hi> (ye that are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, ye that are holy,) <hi>and give thanks at the remembrance of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> And yet again, Pſal. 30.4. <hi>Sing unto the Lord, O ye Saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far of the Object of our Saviours Prayer, as he is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by his title Father, and his attribute <hi>Holy, Holy Father.</hi> Proceed we now to enter on the parts of it.</p>
                  <p>There are two things eſpecially for which our Saviour is a ſuitor to his Father, in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples; Preſervation and Sanctification. To theſe may be reduced and referred all that he deſires for them, preſervation in my text, and onward to <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the reſt that follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he deſireth preſervation, <hi>Keep them through thy own name.</hi> And this deſire of his, he backs eſpecially with two reaſons, and they are weighty and of great importance. Firſt he would have his Father keep them now, becauſe he himſelf had kept them, and kept them very ſafe till now. <hi>While I was with them in the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I kept them; and none of them is loſt, but the Son of perdition,</hi> but he who was deſigned to be loſt. <hi>And now I come to thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, I am to be no more among them, and therefore I beſeech thee now receive them into thy ſpecial care and tuition. Here I reſign them ſafe, and whole, and ſound to thee, I pray thee keep them henceforward as well as I have done to this time. Secondly he would have his Father keep them, becauſe they were in ſuch a dangerous place, where they were in great peril every day, and every hour, where they were hated and maligned upon all hand, and that for the truths ſake. <hi>I have given them thy word, and the world hath hated them,</hi> and ſo on. And therefore I beſeech thee Father, look to them, and <hi>keep them from the evil,</hi> as it is added in the next verſe. The evil of fault, and the evil of pain. Some other things are interpoſed and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed incidentally, which ſhall be handled in their places.</p>
                  <p>The thing deſired, is firſt in order to be handled, before we pitch upon the Arguments and Reaſons with which our Saviour preſſeth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth this deſire of his; and this, as we have heard, is preſervation. And here we have to be conſidered two things: Firſt the means by which our Saviour here deſires that his Apoſtles and Diſciples might be kept, and that is by or through his Fathers name. <hi>Holy Father, keep
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:46169:165"/>
through thy own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi> And Secondly the end for which he prayes they might be kept, <hi>that they may be one as we are.</hi> So that you ſee the ſupplication of our Saviour Chriſt is full, he prayes both for the Means and End, deſireth that the end might be attained for them by the means.</p>
                  <p>Begin we with the means by which our Saviour here deſires that his Apoſtles and Diſciples might be kept, and that is <hi>through his Fathers name. Holy Father, keep through thine own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name of God is generally taken for any thing that makes him known to men, as one man is diſtinguiſhed from another by his name: Particularly it imports ſometimes the attributes of God, now one and then another of them. Sometimes his attribute of mercy, as that is called the name of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.5, 6. <hi>The Lord deſcended in a Cloud,</hi> and there proclaimed the name of God. And what was that? <hi>The Lord, the Lord God mercifull and gratious, and long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth: Keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſsion and ſin.</hi> Sometimes his attribute of Juſtice, as that is alſo called his name in the very ſame place, <hi>who will by no means clear the guilty, viſiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the children, and upon the childrens children, unto the third and fourth generation.</hi> Sometimes his attribute of Power is intimated by his name, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.1. <hi>The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble, the name of the God of</hi> Jacob <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee,</hi> that is, the power of God defend thee. And this is that by which our Saviour prayes, that his, Apoſtles and Diſciples might be kept, <hi>keep them through thy own name,</hi> that is; through thy own power. And ſo accordingly the point to be obſerved, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> They that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, as long at they remain in this world, are kept by the Almighty power of God himſelf.</head>
                  <p>It is the prayer of our Saviour for them, in my text you ſee, <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own name, whom thou haſt given me,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of queſtion they are kept by that name, the almighty power of God. For Jeſus Chriſt is alwayes heard in every thing for which he is a Suitor to his Father.</p>
                  <p>So that his people are as ſafe as the power of God can make them. They are committed by him to his Fathers Cuſtody, and he is able ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well <hi>to keep that which is committed to him,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And this is clearly intimated in our Saviours ſpeech, <hi>John</hi> 10.29. with reference to his people, <hi>My Father which gave them me is greater then all.</hi> Greater, in what regard? greater in place and dignity? No my beloved, greater in power and in ability. And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand.</hi> Many are willing, but none is able becauſe his power is infinitely greater then theirs is. So in another place, <hi>he ſhall be holden up, Rom.</hi> 14.4. he that is weak
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:46169:166"/>
ſhall be held up; how ſo? For God is able to make him ſtand. And <hi>Jude</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>he is able to keep us from falling,</hi> verſe 24. you ſee our preſervation and ſupport is ſtill aſcribed to the power and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God, by which it is apparent what guards us, that we are kept, and kept ſafe by that power. That of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is expreſs and full, ſo that we need to add no more for confirmation, <hi>we are kept by the power of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5. The point is plain, They that belong, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to open this a little, becauſe you do not ſee it in the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of it, you muſt conceive that ſuch as appertain to Jeſus Chriſt, are kept by the almighty power of God; Eſpecially two wayes. Either by the power of God in them, or by the power of God for them. Either by the power of God aſſiſting, or by the power of God protecting. Either by the power of God within them ſtrengthening, or by the power of God without them guarding and defending. I ſhall ſpeak to theſe in order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They that belong to Jeſus Chriſt are kept by the Almighty power of God in them; aſſiſting them and ſtrengthning them, and fortifying them to ſtand, and to hold out, both in temptations and afflictions. Man is by nature <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a feeble and infirm thing. <hi>So weakned and enfeebled with his fail, that of himſelf he is able to do nothing.</hi> And therefore God communicates his own tranſcendent power to ſuch as he intends to keep and to preſerve, ſo far as they are capable of it. And thus how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be weak in themſelves, yet they are <hi>ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. <hi>He ſtands by and ſtrengthens them,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17. And of this inward ſtrengthning it is that the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Col. 1.11. <hi>Strengthned with all might accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his glorious power,</hi> that is the power of God himſelf, which he gives in to his people, and ſo corroborates them, makes them ſtrong as Oaks, to bear the burthen that is laid upon them. For if you mark it, the Apoſtle ſaith not, the power of God bears our afflictions, reſiſts and overcomes our temptations for us but <hi>we are ſtrengthened by his glorious power</hi> to both theſe. <hi>And God is able,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>to do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly according to his power that worketh in us,</hi> Eph. 3.20. Obſerve it well; not his power that worketh <hi>for us,</hi> but his power that worketh <hi>in us,</hi> and that makes us able. So that you ſee my brethren, it is an infuſed thing, there goes forth power and vertue from the Lord to us, and becomes inherent in us. Not as one friend may help another that is weak, with an external ſuccour and ſupport, bearing his heavy burthen for him, but giving him ability himſelf to bear it. Even as a man that hath been much enfeebled with along ſickneſs, and being now recovered in a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and his malignant humours purged away, encreaſeth every day in ſtrength: So we my Brethren, having been enfeebled by the fall, <hi>God makes us ſound and ſtrong again, enables us to do and ſuffer what he cals us to</hi> So that it is an inward and habitual power that we partake, infuſed into the ſoul by God. And God in this reſpect is ſtrong in us. His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is perfected, declared to be perfect in our weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now my beloved, to follow this a little further, this glorious power
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:46169:166"/>
of his the Lord conveyeth into a Chriſtians ſoul through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Father hath annointed him with the Holy Ghoſt and with power,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, Acts 10.38. <hi>And upon him the ſpirit of power doth reſt,</hi> as you have it in the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. That ſo from him it might be given out to all his people. He is the Conduit-pipe through which the ſpirit and the graces of it run, obtaining them by vertue of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious interceſſion from his Father, and ſo conveying them to every member, as he (by reaſon of his near communion with the manhood, being more deeply touched with the feeling of their wants) obſerveth their neceſsities to be. And ſo to every one of us is given grace; and what is grace but power to do, and power to ſuffer? power to ſtand out, and not to faint or yield in temptations or afflictions? Habitual grace is nothing but the inward ſtrengthening of the ſoul. <hi>To every one of us, I ſay is given grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.2. that is as he is pleaſed to diſtribute.</p>
                  <p>And as this power proceeds originally from the Father by and through Jeſus Chriſt, ſo it is wrought immediatly by the Holy Ghoſt. And hence the ſtrength infuſed into a Chriſtians ſoul, is called <hi>the ſpirit of power,</hi> as you may ſee, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Becauſe indeed it is wrought in us by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. That place of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is cleer and full to this purpoſe, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. where he deſireth God in the behalf of that people, <hi>That he would grant them to be ſtrengthened with all might in the inner man.</hi> How ſo? Why by his ſpirit, as you may ſee in that place. And thus you ſee both that, and how they that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, are kept by the almighty power of God in them.</p>
                  <p>They that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, are alſo kept by the almighty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> power of God for them. For even as God is ſtrong in them, ſo he is alſo ſtrong for them. And as he makes them ſtrong, ſo he ſhews himſelf ſtrong in their behalf, as the Expreſſion is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16 9. <hi>The eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of thoſe whoſe hearts are perfect with him.</hi> And thus they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept, not only by the power of God ſtrengthing and fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them within, but alſo by the power of God protecting them, and helping them without. And therefore it is ſaid <hi>the name of the Lord,</hi> that is, the power of the Lord <hi>is a ſtrong Tower, the righteous runneth to it and is ſafe,</hi> Prov. 18.10. Now ſecurity of any perſon that runneth to a Tower for ſhelter, conſiſts not in his own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of the Tower he runs to. A ſtrong Tower will protect a weak man; if he can get within it he is ſafe. And ſuch a ſtong Tower is the name, the power of God for the ſafeguard of his people. And thus you ſee, he keeps us through his own name, his own power (according to our Saviours prayer in my text) in a way of protection, by giving outward help and ſuccour, when we are in great danger. And this outward help he gives us two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt ſometimes immediately by his own power: he helpeth us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his own almighty arm, without the uſe of ſecond cauſes, and then his arm is made bare. He brings in ſuccour to his people, as he made the world of nothing, and therefore he is ſaid in Scripture, to create it,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:46169:167"/>
as you may ſee that place for inſtance, Iſa. 65.18. <hi>Be ye glad and rejoice for ever, in that which I create, for behold I create</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a rejoycing, and her people a joy.</hi> And thus he kept his people in the fire, and in the water, and in the wilderneſs, where there were no means at all of preſervation, he did it meerly by his own name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sometimes he helps and keeps his people mediately by his power communicated for that end to ſecond cauſes: He raiſes inſtruments of their delivery, and makes them able to relieve his people, as he did the Judges often. And as it is obſerved of <hi>David,</hi> when God was pleaſed to uſe him for the help of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in a time of great diſtreſs, he furniſhed him with power ſufficient to go through with the buſineſs which he had deſigned him to. And therefore ſaith the Lord of that inſtrument of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, 20. <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty, I have exalted one choſen out of the people, I have found</hi> David <hi>my ſervant, with my holy oil have I annointed him.</hi> Mighty he is to help indeed, but it is becauſe I have made him ſo, becauſe I have laid help upon him. And ſo he ſtirs up ſome continually to favour and relieve his people; he makes the earth ſometimes to help the woman, men that have nothing elſe but earth in them; but ſtill the power by which they help them is from him. Their power is his power, and therefore when his people are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and kept by them, they are kept by his name, as you have it in my text, and his name muſt have the glory.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall ſuffice for explication of the point, they that belong to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, are kept by the almighty power of God himſelf. And there is pregnant reaſon for it. For firſt of all, no other power but his will keep them, and his is every way ſufficient. And ſecondly his power is mightily engaged to keep them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> They that belong to Jeſus Chriſt are kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe no other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but his will keep them. Kept they muſt be, and none but this alone will do it. Alas the adverſaries power that is againſt them, is abundantly too ſtrong for any power that can appear for them, but that of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God himſelf. The power of all the world, and all the ſtrong temptations that are in it, of pleaſure, profit, honour, which is bent againſt the Saints, you will conceive to be a great matter: Yet this is nothing in compariſon; this is the leaſt part of their danger. What think you of the power of all the luſts and the corruptions that are in them, that are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually raging, warring? Who is able of himſelf to overpower and maſter theſe? What think you of the power of Satan, and his black confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, the power of darkneſs, as it is ſtiled in the Scripture? All the united ſtrength of hell it ſelf? nothing but the power of heaven is able to out wreſtle this: and they that will ſtruggle with it, had need be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by that glorious power.</p>
                  <p>And hence our Saviour places the ſecurity of his Diſciples in this <hi>That they are kept by him that is greater then all,</hi> John 10.29. That is, of greater ſtrength, as I have ſhewed, ſo that <hi>none can pluck them out of his hand.</hi>

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:46169:167"/>
And that eſpecially two wayes, by the Sons prayer, and the Fathers promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Sons prayer, and that muſt not be denyed; For this we need to go no further then my text; <hi>Holy Father keep them through thy own name.</hi> It was one of the laſt requeſts he made when he was taking leave of this world, and therefore certainly it was ſucceſsfull. <hi>Simon, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Satan hath deſired to winnow thee as wheat.</hi> But how is <hi>Peter</hi> kept now? Why by our Saviours interceſsion, <hi>I have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the Fathers promiſe; he hath engaged himſelf by promiſe to his people many times, that his power ſhall be for them. The Covenant is a Conſtellation, and a heap of promiſes, and he is a God in Covenant with them. So that as he himſelf is theirs, ſo all his attributes are theirs too. His mercy to forgive them, his juſtice to avenge them, his power to keep them.</p>
                  <p>The Romans were in league with many people, and if thoſe people were in danger, they were obliged in point of honour to defend them; And ſo they did with as much diligence and care as they did their own City. Even thus it is between the Lord and his people; he is in League and Covenant with them, and he hath undertaken their protection: And therefore if they be in any ſtreight, he is bound in point of honour to ſet his power on work to ſave them: And hence it is that they are kept by the almighty power of God as long as they remain in this world.</p>

We are in danger every day and every hour as long as we remain in this world; we have mighty enemies both without us and within us; we walk continually in the midſt of traps and ſnares, and gins that Satan and his inſtruments do lay for us. How are we preſerved now, and where is our ſecurity? Truly my brethren, not in our own wiſdom, grace, ſtrength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the name of God himſelf. We are kept by his power, and not our own. Our bleſſed Saviour in his prayer doth not commit us to our ſelves, or any thing that is in us, but to his Fathers own name, <hi>q. d.</hi> They cannot keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by any grace or ſtrength that is within them or without them; and therefore <hi>I beſeech thee Father keep them through thy own name.</hi>

               <p>Well then, my brethren, let none of us be ſtrong in his own ſtrength, let us not truſt to our own abilities to ſupport us and uphold us, to bear us up, and to ſafeguard us, in temptations and afflictions. But let us know that grace received and infuſed is not ſufficient of it ſelf to keep us, unleſs it be corroborated and ſupported ſtill with new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting grace and ſtrength from God. And therefore he is ſaid to keep
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:46169:168"/>
us who are ſanctified, that we fall not. And we are kept not by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent faith alone, <hi>but by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation;</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. And thus the Lord hath ordered it, that though we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſome degrees of grace and ſpiritual ſtrength, we might be held to a perpetual neceſſary firm dependance on him, notwithſtanding: And therefore when we rely on what we have received already, as if thoſe meaſures which we have inherent in our ſelves were ſtrong enough to cope with a temptation, the Lord will let us ſee how weak it is, by the withdrawing of his ſuccour from us. And this indeed was <hi>Peters</hi> caſe, he was too bold and confident upon the ſtrength of his inherent grace, he thought no doubt his faith was ſo impregnable, that no temptation could prevail ſo far againſt it, to cauſe him to deny his Lord and Maſter; No, not the fear of death it ſelf: and therefore God deſerted him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his aſſiſting grace, and ſo he fell in the temptation; let us be wary of the ſame error, leſt we find the ſame iſſue.</p>

And this was that which <hi>Abraham</hi> truſted in, and ſtayed himſelf upon, in ſuch a caſe wherein there was no likelihood, no probability at all to a humane apprehenſion. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4.20. And whereupon did he repoſe and reſt his faith? on the Almighty power of God, <hi>being fully perſwaded that what he had promiſed, he was able to perform:</hi> And ſo let us, my Brethren, reſt on this power in all extremities and ſtreights, let us hide our ſelves in the Name of God, and let us not be daſhed, or permit our hearts to ſink by reaſon of improbabilities, or want of means: But let us ſeriouſly conſider with our ſelves, that Jeſus Chriſt hath, as it were, reſigned us up into his Fathers hands, to be kept by his Name. And by that name and power of his, let us be confident we ſhall be kept, what ever our diſtreſſes be.</p>
               <p>And more particularly according to the Explication of the point, let us be confident, that if the danger be within, we ſhall be kept by the Almighty power of God within us ſtrengthening. If our danger be without, we ſhall be kept by the Almighty power of God without us guarding and defending.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If our danger be within, by reaſon of temptations or afflictions that lye hard upon us, and are about to overcome us, let us take courage to our ſelves, and reſolve we ſhall be kept by this Almighty power of God within us, ſtrengthening and ſupporting: And that we ſhall be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with all might, according to his glorious power. Oh thy temptations or afflictions (thou wilt ſay) are a cruſhing burthen to thee, thou art not able to ſuſtain it: Thou wilt cry out as <hi>Job</hi> perhaps, Job 6.11. <hi>What is my ſtrength that I ſhould hope? Is my ſtrength the ſtrength of ſtones? or is my fleſh of braſs?</hi> But man conſider, is it thy own ſtrength that thou
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:46169:168"/>
ſtandeſt in? If it were ſo, I muſt confeſs thy caſe were very ſad indeed. But if thou be ſupported by the glorious power of an Almighty God, why ſhouldſt thou doubt or be diſcouraged? Thus far perhaps (although with many bitter pangs of fear) thou haſt paſt through the midſt of thy temptations and afflictions; thou haſt been ſhaken fearfully, but yet thou haſt not utterly been overthrown and caſt down, thou haſt not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the <hi>Holy One,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks; How haſt thou been ſupported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, but by the Name of God himſelf? was it not he that ſtrengthned thee in thoſe diſtreſſes, fears and agonies of thine? and cannot he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thee ſtill? Is Gods hand ſhortned, that he cannot help? is any thing too hard for the Almighty?</p>
               <p>Suppoſe thy burthen ſhall be heavier yet, as that it may be is thy great fear: Is that any thing to God? is not his glorious Name ſufficient to keep and bear thee up, as well in heavier as in higher trials, that hath kept thee hitherto (it muſt be yeilded) or elſe thou hadſt been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in thy troubles? And what now will it be too weak, if thou be brought to greater exigencies and diſtreſſes? Indeed if thou wer't kept by creature-ſtrength, either within thee, or without thee, the difference were very great, I muſt confeſs, between a heavy and a light affliction. But now it matters not at all; it is all one to the Almighty power of God, that will be ſufficient for thee, let the caſe be what it will, or what it can. It may be thou conceiveſt, that if thy burthen were a little heavier, if but a grain or two were added to it, thou wert gone, thou muſt be overlaid, and cruſhed, and broken inſtantly. Oh but remember that of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 3.16. <hi>God is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we can either ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us.</hi> He is able by that power whereby he hath ſuſtained thee ſo long, to ſtrengthen and ſupport thee ſtill; what ever further trial come upon thee, beyond all that thou canſt ask, yea beyond all that thou canſt think, he is able to do more then thou art able to imagine.</p>
               <p>If our danger be without, from enemies that ſet againſt us with all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their policy and power, and have reduced us to great extremities and ſtreights; let us reſolve we ſhall be kept by the Almighty power of God without us, guarding and defending. Let us ſay boldly as the Pſalmiſt did in ſuch a caſe, <hi>The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man can do unto me.</hi> I muſt confeſs that we are apt to caſt away our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and to deſpair of ſuccour and deliverance. It was the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> weakneſs, as himſelf acknowledges, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10. But if we fail at any time with holy <hi>David,</hi> let us come off as he did; let us ingenuouſly confeſs that it is our infirmity, and let us call to mind with him, the right hand of the moſt High. Oh let us think upon the great and the Almighty power of God; for that is intimated by his right hand, which commonly is ſtronger then the left, and ſo let us uphold our fainting ſpirits, when they are apt to ſink within us. As <hi>Luther</hi> did, when one ſuppoſed that the Emperor with all his Forces would fall upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was the great Protector of the Proteſtants at that time: And where, ſaith he, will <hi>Luther</hi> be then? That holy man returned this ſuddain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Aut in Coelo, aut ſub Coelo,</hi> either in Heaven, or under Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:46169:169"/>
he expected protection from Heaven as long as he lived, and knew he ſhould have poſſeſſion of heaven when ever he died.</p>
               <p>But may we reſt upon it then, that we ſhall have protection from the Name of God in all dangers? That he will keep us through his own Name?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, if we belong to Jeſus Chriſt, we may be ſure we ſhall be kept by it, either one way or other, either from the outward danger, or elſe from the inward dammage; either in a way of deliverance, or if not ſo, in a way of aſſiſtance. The Prayer of our Interceſſor in my text ſhall not be in all reſpects in vain for us. It's true, the Lord may leave us ſometimes in the outward danger, and may not keep us by his power for us; But then he will be ſure to keep us by his power in us. If he take not off our burthen, he will give us ſtrength to bear it. And if he do not keep us from the evill, he will keep us in the evil. One way or other we ſhall have ſuccour from his great Name. If it be not a ſhield to cover us and protect us, it ſhall be an arm to underprop us and ſupport us; <hi>underneath us ſhall be the everlaſting arms,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33 27. So that here is comfort ſtill, in any trial or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: If we be not delivered from it, we ſhall be enabled to bear it.</p>
               <p>And here leſt any of you ſhould look on this as cold comfort. I muſt tell you that it is a richer mercy to be enabled by the power of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to bear a trial, then to be reſcued and delivered from it by his power without; this latter we deſire moſt; but out of doubt the firſt is beſt for us: For do but weigh it, my Beloved, outward help and outward ſuccor and deliverance by the power of God, is but a common mercy, of which the worſt of men partake; yea of which the beaſts partake; in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect he ſaveth man and beaſt. How often doth the Lord put forth his power to reſcue the vileſt of the ſons of men, from outward danger; yea the vileſt of the creatures! But he ſupports and ſtrengthens by his grace within, none but his own people. It is the proper and peculiar priviledge of thoſe that are given up to Jeſus Chriſt, to be kept this way by the Name of God. <hi>Paul</hi> was importunate you know, to be delivered from the Meſſenger of Satan that was ſent to buffet him; <hi>For this thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſought the Lord thrice, that is might depart from me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.8. He could not ſpeed in that Petition, he could not get deliverance, but he got ſupport, which was abundantly the richeſt mercy: And when did God ever ſay to an ungodly wretch in ſuch a caſe, as he doth there to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee, and my ſtrength is perfected in weakneſs?</hi> He hath very often given wicked men ſufficient outward ſuccour, but he never gave them yet ſufficient inward grace; this is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to his own people.</p>

Name:</hi> And therefore when you know not what to do, run to this Tower, the Name of God: <hi>Seek the Lord, and ſeek his ſtrength,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt counſels you, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.4. For you muſt know, my Brethren, it is not enough to make us capable of having ſure protection in the name and power of God, that we belong to Jeſus Chriſt; No, we may be ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of our duty, that we may be deſerted for the preſent of the power of God, and may not have it to relieve us and defend us: And this is that which <hi>Ezra</hi> intimates, Ezra 8.22. <hi>The hand,</hi> that is, the power of God, <hi>is upon all them for good that ſeek him:</hi> If we neglect him, we may miſs of favour from him, as <hi>Aſa</hi> did in ſuch a caſe, the Lord would not put forth his power to heal him, becauſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to Phyſitians: And therefore when we are in danger any way, from within, or from without, let us lift up our hearts and cry to God, with the afflicted Church, Pſal. 80.2. <hi>Stir up thy ſtrength and come and ſave us;</hi> and let us ſee that we do it in the way that God would have us, and that we ſeek him in the due order, as the expreſſion is, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. And to this end I ſhall give you ſome directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Seek him early while he may be found</hi> of you; you muſt not run through all your other holds, and fly to all your other ſtays, and when you find that you are diſappointed in them all, then go to hide your ſelves, and not till then in this Name, when you know not what to do; for then perhaps the Lord will ſhut the doors againſt you, and leave you helpleſs in your troubles: And truly it is juſt with God, that they that ſeek not to him, till they be driven out of all their ſhifts, ſhould be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him when they come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Humbly, or elſe the Name of God will not be a refuge to you. You may come to him for ſhelter, but he will not receive you into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; No, he will reſiſt the proud, he will keep them out of doors, he will leave them ſuccourleſs in their diſtreſſes. They were ſo proud, and their ſtomachs were ſo high in proſperous times, that they looked not after God, <hi>God was not in all their thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 10.4. And therefore now when they come running to him, becauſe they know not how to live without him, the Lord will look as little after them; let them do what they will for God. But on the other ſide, my Brethren, there are many ſweet and pretious promiſes of mercy &amp; protection to the humble perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Heartily, <hi>with all the heart, and all the ſoul,</hi> for ſo is the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.29. you muſt not ſeek him feignedly with half a heart, with a divided ſpirit; for if you do, you may expect ſuch entertainment as is threatned to thoſe diſſembling wretches mentioned Prov. 1.28. <hi>They ſhall call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me;</hi> and you may look to ſpeed as hollow-hearted <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, Hoſ. 5.6 <hi>They ſhall go with their flocks and with their herds to ſeek the Lord, and ſhall not find him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Reformedly, in a way of Reformation, and amendment. It is in vain for a prophane and filthy perſon, ſo continuing, to run to the name of God in his diſtreſſes; He muſt not look for any ſhelter there, he ſhall not come neer God, for God will be ſanctified in all that come near him. He that cannot endure to look upon prophaneſs with his eye, will not

               <p n="5">5.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Is it ſo, that they that belong to Chriſt are kept, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If then we have been kept in any dangers or diſtreſſes, let us look up to this Name: let us not reſt in the external means, and ſecondary cauſes of our ſuccour or deliverance; but let us look beyond them and above them, to the name of God. Let us ſee this Name of his engraven and enſtampt upon them, as the Prophet counſels, Mich. 6.9. <hi>The man of wiſdom ſhall ſee thy Name;</hi> and when we ſee it, let us acknowledge it to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our help, the cauſe of all our ſuccour and deliverance: Let us confeſs that God (according to our Saviours Prayer in my Text) hath kept us through his own Name. And let his Name have all the glory.</p>
               <p>And thus far of the means by which our Saviour here deſires, that his Diſciples and Apoſtles might be kept, his Fathers Name; <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, keep through thy own Name thoſe whom thou haſt given me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The End for which he prays they might be kept, comes now in order to be handled, <hi>That they may be one as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſtrange expreſſion, if we look upon it with a ſuperficial view. That the Diſciples of our Saviour may be one in ſome reſpects, is very eaſie to imagine: But how they ſhould be one, as God the Father and the Son are one, who are ſo one that they are the very ſame, the ſame eſſence, (for ſo the union is identical) though they be not the ſame perſon, this is hard to be conceived; yet this is the expreſſion of our Saviour to his Father in my Text, <hi>That they be one as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which that you may the better underſtand, my Brethren, you muſt know that [as] in Scripture is many times a note of ſimilitude, and not of equality. It intimates the truth and the reality of that wherein the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtands, and not the meaſure and degree. I might give many inſtances wherein that particle is ſo taken; you may ſee that place for inſtance, Luk. 6.36. <hi>Be you merciful, as your Father alſo is merciful.</hi> It is impoſſible for any man to be merciful as God, if you look to the degree: For as the Heavens are higher then the Earth, ſo are his ways and thoughts above ours, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to mercy and forgiveneſs: But yet we may be merciful as God is, really and truly ſo, although not ſo in ſuch a meaſure. We may be merciful as he, though not as merciful as he. So in my Text our Saviour prays in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples to his Father, <hi>that they may be one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as we are,</hi> as thee and I are. The meaning is not, that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:46169:170"/>
they may be one as neerly (that is impoſſible) but that they may be one as truly as we are. Not that they may be one by a ſubſtantial and identical, but by a real union as we are. Not that they many be one in all reſpects, but that they may be one in ſome reſpects as we are.</p>
               <p>But you will ask me then, what thoſe reſpects are? I will ſhew you in a Word. God and Chriſt, the Father and the Son are two perſons. And yet though they be two perſons, they agree in every thing Though they be divers, yet they never differ; No, they do continually minde the ſame things, they will and nill the ſame things, they love and hate the ſame things: There is an unexpreſſible agreement and conſent between them every way; even ſo it is exceedingly to be deſired, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Saviour, though they be many perſons, yet they may be of one mind, and one heart, and one affection: That they may agree in all things, that there may be no difference, no diviſions, no jars, no ſtrifes, no rents among them; but that they may in this reſpect be one, even as the Father and Son are.</p>
               <p>And this, you ſee, is the great thing for which our Saviour is a ſuitor to his Father, in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that they might be at unity among themſelves. This is the end for which he prays they may be kept by the Almighty power of God himſelf, that as far as it is poſſible for men to be, they may be one, even as the Father and the Son are one; <hi>Holy Father keep them through thy own Name, that they may be one as we are.</hi> So that the Obſervation clearly intimated here is this.</p>

                  <p>Both theſe particulars, I take it, are apparently ſuggeſted in the words, Firſt, that it is a point of wondrous difficulty; Then that it is a point of high concernment, that all that are beſtowed on Jeſus Chriſt, ſhould (as far as men may be) be one, as God and Chriſt are one. I ſhall clear them in order, from the Text and other Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>It is a matter of wondrous difficulty, even for Chriſts Diſciples to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at neereſt unity among themſelves. Our Saviour ſaw it to be very hard for them in all things to agree together, and therefore he deſires it may be brought about by the Almighty power of God himſelf; <hi>Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther keep them through thy own Name, that they may be one as we are.</hi> He prays his Father to ſet his own Almighty power about it, to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it; by which he intimateth that it is no eaſie matter. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable how the Apoſtle ſtruggles for it, 2 Theſſ. 3.16. <hi>The God of peace himſelf give you peace always by all means:</hi> So that there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of having peace, unleſs God himſelf beſtow it; unleſs he bow the heavens and come down, and work it in the hearts of his people. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of any creature to keep the Saints themſelves in unity and peace, unleſs God himſelf do it. And ſo the Apoſtle having well conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wondrous difficulty of it, turns himſelf to God. <hi>Now the God of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:46169:171"/>
peace himſelf give it. q. d.</hi> I ſee no other means will do it, and therefore I beſeech thee Lord, thou who art the God of peace, do thou thy ſelf make unity among thy people. That phraſe of the Apoſtle is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to this purpoſe. Eph. 4.3. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi>

                     </gap>, The word there uſed, imports the doing of a thing with much intention, with inward care, and outward diligence, and labour, and endeavour to the very utmoſt. The ſetting of ones ſelf about a buſineſs ſtrenuouſly, and with all his might, which would not need, if it were an eaſie matter. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> So that you ſee it is a matter of wondrous difficulty, for Chriſts Diſciples to be at neereſt unity among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me how it ſhould be ſo? A man would think it ſhould be no hard matter for Chriſts Diſciples to be all one: for them who are ſo cloſely and ſo neerly joyned ſo many wayes, and by ſo many tyes; who are all one body, one ſpirit, who have all one Head, one God, one Lord, one faith, one hope, one baptiſm, to be at unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Indeed it is a task almoſt inſuperable to have peace with all the world. To ſay the truth, it is impoſſible, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates in his exhortation, Rom. 12.18. <hi>If it be poſsible, as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> But to live peaceably with Saints and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low members, for ſuch to be at unity among themſelves, what difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould there be in this! How cometh it to paſs that this is ſuch a hard matter, That the almighty power of God himſelf is called down from heaven about it?</p>
                  <p>Why my beloved there be many things even in the Saints and Chriſts Diſciples, that make the matter difficult. And I ſhall draw them all that I ſhall mention, to theſe two heads. There are ſome things in which they are too much alike, and there are other things in which they differ overmuch; and both of them do make it wonderfully hard even for the Saints to be at unity among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There are ſome things in which they are too much alike to agree among themſelves. They are all (the holieſt of them) too carnal, they have too much corruption in them eaſily to cloſe together. And this is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves in the Corinthians, 1 Epiſt. 3.3. <hi>Whereas there is among you ſtrife, and envy, and diviſion, are you not carnal?</hi> Is it not very manifeſt, that there is much corruption, and much fleſh in you? And is not this the cauſe of theſe diſſentions? It may be you are apt to think it to be otherwiſe, but mark what the Apoſtle ſaith James 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars and fightings among you?</hi> Whence do they come? Why hence they come, will ſome men ſay; I am ſo troubled and moleſted, I am ſo groſly injured and abuſed that I cannot live in peace. Never was any man ſo baſely uſed, ſo vilely dealt withall, as I have been, and that by thoſe that are accounted honeſt men. And hence it is that I cannot be at reſt: No, no, ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, thou art much deceived, I had as lief thou hadſt ſaid nothing. It is the wickedneſs and the corruption that is in thee, that is the true and real cauſe of all this. <hi>From hence come wars and fightings among you, even
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:46169:171"/>
from your luſts that warr in your members.</hi> And I will ſhew you what thoſe luſts are, which make it ſo extremely hard, even for the Saints to be at unity among themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are too proud: The wiſe man tels us this hath a ſtroke in all quarrels, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. And if in all, then in the quarrels of the Saints too. And truly my beloved, were it not for this, there would not be ſuch endleſs and implacable contentions about matters civil, as there are ſometimes between thoſe that are Chriſts Diſciples. It is their pride that neither ſide will ſtoop or bow; both are high and both are ſtiff, and ſo there can no poſſible accommodation or accord be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                  <p>And were it not for pride there would not be ſuch endleſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable contentions about matters doctrinal. This is the true and real cauſe, why men will not indure to be gainſaid and croſt in their opinion, but preſently they fret and fume and fall into an everlaſting ſtrife about words, <hi>whereof cometh envy, railing, evil ſurmiſings, and perverſe diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhewes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4, 5. Now would you have the character of ſuch a perſon as carryes matters in this faſhion? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he is proud, knowing nothing.</hi> He thinks himſelf a very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, but this is nothing but his pride. And hence it comes to paſs that men are ſo unalterable in their fancies and conceipts, that having once aſſerted them and owned them, they will not lay them down again (no though they be convinced) for their honours ſake. Remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and exemplary is the reſolution and humility of <hi>Job</hi> in ſuch a caſe, Job 6.24. <hi>Teach me and I will hold my peace, and make me know wherein I have erred.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which ingenuous diſpoſition, did thoſe who differ in their judgements conſtantly agree, they might be quickly brought, if not wherein they err, to change their minds, yet to allay them ſo, with humility and love, that they ſhould never break forth into bitterneſs againſt their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. But while they have ſuch a deal of pride among them (while they are ſo alike in this regard) it is impoſſible they ſhould agree together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is impoſſible, even for the Saints, to be in all reſpects at unity among themſelves, becauſe as they are too proud, ſo they are too ſelfiſh. Herein they are too near alike eaſily to cloſe together. This is indeed the great make-bate, it hath a ſpecial hand, and is a violent eager ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in all the quarrels that are driven to and fro among men. From hence it is that men are ſo inflexible and ſo extremly ſtiff in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they will abate nothing, nor yield to nothing for quietneſs and peace ſake; it is their love, not to the truth, but to themſelves, it is their ſelf-love. And ſo it is the ſelfiſhneſs of men that makes them ſo intent upon their own things that they will have the utmoſt in a buſineſs, and urge extremity of right, and will not part with any thing almoſt to purchaſe pretious peace. It is becauſe they love themſelves too well, and becauſe there is ſo much of this even in the Saints, this makes it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully hard for them to be at unity among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I might name other things in which they are too much alike to cloſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:46169:172"/>
ſo nearly as they ſhould, but theſe ſhall ſerve for that branch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It is a hard thing for the Saints to live at unity among themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there are ſome things in which they are too much alike: So there are other things in which they differ overmuch, ſo cloſe ſo nearly as they ſhould together. For differences make diviſions many times, even among Chriſts Diſciples. And that you may the better look into the buſineſs, I will ſhew you many things in which they differ many times, which render a conjunction and a perfect union infinitely hard to be made and kept among them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are of divers tempers and of divers conſtitutions, and thoſe will hardly cloſe together. As divers ſtrings, unleſs they be of purpoſe tun'd alike, will not be uniſons, they will not be of one ſound: They may be very ſweet apart, but if you ſtrike them all together, they will make a diſcord; So it is in this caſe: ſome of the Saints are of a melancholy ſad, and others of a ſanguine cheerfull temper. The melancholy doth not like the cheerfull, the cheerfull doth not like the melancholy Saint. Or if he like him in his judgement, he cares not to converſe with him, or not ſo much at leaſt as with another, becauſe he doth not ſuit his diſpoſition. One Saint by reaſon of his conſtitution, (which grace doth never wholly alter,) is very hot and very active: Another Saint is very cold, and very dull. Thoſe two being ſo unlike, will continually be diſliking one another, and it may be cenſuring: ſo that it will be very hard to bring them to ſo near a cloſe as ſhould be between Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are of divers ſtations and conditions, in the world, and in the Church. Some are high, and ſome are low, ſome are rich and ſome are poor. The high are ready to deſpiſe the low, the low are ready to envy the high. The rich are ready to deſpiſe the poor; the poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One of them will be apt on all occaſions to be perking at the other. And this will make a perfect union extremly difficult between them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They are of divers intereſts by reaſon of their callings, judgements, opinions, habitations, outward ſubſtance and eſtates; and differences will ariſe and grow from all theſe; So that it will be hard to keep them quiet, and to hold them cloſe together. <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> is the riſe of all diſſentions; it is this ſame thine and mine, that ſetteth men, yea the beſt men ſometimes together by the Ears. This is my right, and that is thine; this is my place, and that is thine; this is my opinion, and that is thine. If the intereſt were one, they would be one; but ſure it cannot be avoided, but it will be ſo different, in this world; there will be differences now and then even among the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It was upon the point of intereſt that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fell out though they were both good men. And it is noted by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf as one eſpecial reaſon of the ſtrange conſent and harmony that was among the primitive Saints, becauſe their intereſt was one, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>The multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one ſoul.</hi> How ſo? <hi>They had all things common, neither ſaid any of them that any of the things which he poſſeſſed were his own.</hi> The ſtate of thoſe times, my brethren, both admitted and required it, and we ſee the fruit of it. It is not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:46169:172"/>
ſo, and to ſay truth, cannot be ſo in our dayes, and therefore it is much the harder to keep perfect unity among the Saints. When once they ſhall come all to be in one place, in one condition, of one opinion, and to have one inheritance, and ſo to have one common intereſt among them all, when God ſhall be all in all, there will be no more diviſions; but in the mean time it is impoſſible they ſhould in every thing agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are of divers qualifications. <hi>There are diverſities of gifts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. Now theſe I muſt acknowledge are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to beget union. But yet by accident, by reaſon of remainders of corruption in the Saints, they cauſe diviſions. While ſome are of more judgement, and other ſome of more affection; while ſome are of greater, and other ſome of meaner gifts, here are occaſions (I ſay not cauſes, but occaſions) of diſſention, while ſome are ſupercilious, and the other envious. As ſoon as the Apoſtle layes down the diſtinction between ſtrong and weak Chriſtians, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. there follows diſputation and diviſion preſently. The one deſpiſes, and the other judges. The ſtrong Chriſtian is ready upon all occaſions to deſpiſe the weak. The weak Chriſtian is apt upon the other ſide to judge the ſtrong. The ſtrong ſlights, and the weak cenſures, and ſo there is a wofull breach of unity and peace among them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe things it is evident my brethren, that it is a matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous difficulty even for Chriſts Diſciples to be at unity among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And truly if we ſeriouſly conſider how like they are in regard of ſome corruptions, and how different they are in Conſtitutions, Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Intereſts and Qualifications, we will not wonder that the Almighty power of God is invocated by our Saviour to effect it.</p>

               <p>It is a matter of high concernment for Chriſts diſciples to be at near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> unity among themſelves. As of wondrous difficulty, ſo of very great concernment. It is the firſt thing that our Saviour begs in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, <hi>that they might be one:</hi> And prayes his Father to effect it, by his own almighty power. <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own name, that they may be one as we are.</hi> By which he ſhews that as it is a hard thing, ſo it is a choiſe thing, a thing of ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, worthy the putting forth of the almighty power of God about it.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> would have us ſtrain our ſelves to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46169:173"/>
get it and preſerve it, to do as much as lies in us, even to the utmoſt, as much as it is poſſible for men to do, to ſet all our abilities and all our faculties a work to procure and keep peace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18. And to this end having perſwaded the Coloſsians to adorn themſelves with mercy, kindneſs humbleneſs of mind, and with the habits and the acts of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and long-ſuffering as with glorious robes, he perſwadeth them at length to put on love, which is an uniting grace, a bond of perfectneſs, the uppermoſt garment (as it were) and ſo the largeſt, faireſt, richeſt, and moſt pretious piece of the new cloathing of a Chriſtian: And therefore puts a ſpecial Emphaſis upon his exhortation to it; <hi>Above all theſe things put on charity which is the bond of perfectneſs:</hi> which will unite and join you perfectly together. They are not graces of the meaneſt rank that <hi>Paul</hi> commends to the Coloſsians in the former verſes. Yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run through all of them, and being come at length to this uniting grace, as to the top and chief of all, he ſets the finger of a hand againſt it, to point it out as ſupereminent: <hi>Above all theſe things put on charity which is the bond of perfectneſs.</hi> How is the Prophet <hi>David</hi> carried out beyond himſelf, and even raviſhed in the contemplation of this pretious unity among the Saints, and therefore calleth others to join in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. <hi>Behold how good and pleaſant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!</hi> The admirable and ſurpaſsing excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it, is repreſented to us in the Scripture many wayes. If God will promiſe any ſpecial mercy to the Church, it ſhall be this, Iſa. 11.6. <hi>The Wolf and Lamb ſhall dwell together, the Leopard ſhall lye down with the Kid, and the Lyon with the Calf, and a little Child ſhall lead them. And great ſhall be the peace of thy Children,</hi> Iſa, 54.13. If he will give them any choice bleſsing, <hi>The Lord will bleſs his people with peace,</hi> Pſal. 29.11. If we will pray for any favour worth ſtriving for, it muſt be for Church-peace and unity among the Saints. <hi>Pray ye for the peace of Jeruſalem,</hi> Pſalm 112.7. that it may be like a City that is at unity within it ſelf. And therefore the Apoſtle is ſo earneſt for it, as it were for life and death, <hi>The God of peace give you peace alwayes, and by all means.</hi> By which he intimateth that as it is a thing of wondrous difficulty, ſo of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Chriſts Diſciples to be at unity among themſelves. And this I ſhall lay open to you in a few paaticulars.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It is of great concernment to the growth of Chriſts Diſciples, and to their thriving in their ſpiritual eſtate. It is obſerved of the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.32. <hi>that they were of one heart and one ſoul.</hi> And that which follows preſently, is this, <hi>great grace was upon them all.</hi> It ſeems they were in the increaſing and the thriving hand by this means. Where there is great peace among the Saints, there is great grace too. Much union brings forth much communion, and much Communion brings forth much holineſs and much grace. When Chriſtians walk on in a ſweet and amicable way, they cannot chooſe but grow exceedingly. But when diſſentions make them to reſerve themſelves, this is extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the increaſe in holineſs which otherwiſe would be among them. That place of the Apoſtle is very notable to this purpoſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 19. <hi>And not holding the head from which all the body by joints, and bands

               <p>It is of great concernment as to the growth of Chriſts Diſciples,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſo alſo to their comfort, that they be at neareſt unity among themſelves; it is a notable expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe, Col. 2.2. <hi>That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love:</hi> There is the mercy wiſhed them, <hi>that their hearts might be comforted;</hi> and then the requiſite condition and qualification to make them capable of this comfort, <hi>being knit together in love.</hi> Much union, much comfort; little union, little comfort; no union, no comfort: Indeed it is a pleaſant thing for Brethren to live together in unity; but it is a bitter thing to live in diſcord and diſſention; it eats out all the joy and comfort of a man, and fills his ſpirit with vexation: When men are over head and ears in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Contentions, eſpecially Saints with Saints, it makes their lives unquiet and uncomfortable to them: You ſhall obſerve how reſtleſs ſuch men are, who are embroyled in troubles, and who are deep in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies and Contentions; they cannot eat, they cannot ſleep, they cannot talk, they can do nothing cheerfully and freely, they are ſo clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cumbred with their own impatient and perplexed thoughts: Liſten to them, and you ſhall hear them ever and anon complaining that every one is vexing them, and troubling and moleſting them, ſo that they cannot live in peace. Their wives, their children, and their ſervants cannot be at quiet for them, they are in ſuch a pelting humor upon every light occaſion: Their families are like the middle Region of the air, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually rent and torn with ſtorms and thunders and tempeſtuous ſtirs, which riſe at firſt of a thing of nothing, a thin inviſible fume drawn up from the earth: And all this comes to paſs by the diſſentions that they have with others, which takes away the meekneſs of their ſpirits, and with that their quiet too: And therefore you ſhall find a meek and quiet ſpirit joyned together, and made the chief adorning of a Chriſtian, 1 Pet. 2.4. <hi>Whoſe adorning let it be that of the hidden man of the heart, even the adorning of a meek and quiet ſpirit:</hi> It it be meek, it will be quiet; if enraged, it will be troubled; it will be like the Sea that cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt.</p>
               <p>It is of ſo great concernment, as to the growth and comfort of Chriſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Diſciples, that they be at unity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo alſo to their keeping in with God himſelf; they muſt have peace among themſelves, if they will have peace with God; if they be angry one with another, God will be angry with them all. If he come in and find his family together by the ears, he will be in a rage too. <hi>Manaſſeh againſt Ephraim, and Ephraim againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh, and both of them againſt Judah;</hi> and all theſe you muſt know, my Brethren, were within the verge and compaſs of the Church: There were rents and breaches there, they were divided into parties, they were up one againſt another. And what follows? <hi>For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> Iſa. 9.21. And is not this our caſe? Are not the members of the body myſtical of Chriſt divided into factions, that ſtruggle one againſt another (like the twins in <hi>Rebecca's</hi> womb) that bite, and even devour one another? And this I
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:46169:174"/>
make no queſtion, is one cauſe among the reſt why the wrath of the Lord is not turned away. Our wrath is not turned away, and therefore his wrath is not turned way neither. Our hands are ſtretched out one againſt another ſtill, and therefore his hand is ſtretched out againſt us all. We are not yet appeaſed one towards another, and therefore he is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed towards us: We are making and continuing breaches ſtill among our ſelves, and God is making and continuing breaches ſtill among us: He deals with us juſt as we deal with one another; <hi>With the froward,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward,</hi> Pſal. 18.25. We are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly froward to our Brethren, and he is juſtly froward towards us. As we have done, ſo God hath requited us; <hi>Becauſe that</hi> Edom <hi>hath dealt againſt the houſe of</hi> Judah, <hi>ſaith the Lord, by taking vengeance, I will take vengeance upon</hi> Edom, Ezek. 25.12. <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> you muſt know, my Brethren, came out of the ſame loyns; And truly till we ceaſe from taking our revenge, as we have opportunitie, upon our Brethren, God will not ceaſe from taking vengeance upon us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> It is of great concernment to the preſervation of Chriſts Diſciples, that they be at neereſt unity among themſelves. It is one ſpecial means to enable them to ſtand and to hold out againſt their common enemies both without them and within them. It is an eaſie thing to break them and deſtroy them one by one; but if they be united and bound up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (as the Rods which the <hi>Roman</hi> gave his ſons upon his death-bed) they will not be ſo quickly broken; they will find that their union is their ſtrength and preſervation; <hi>If they ſtand faſt in one ſpirit, with one mind, ſtriving together for the faith of the Goſpel, they need to be in nothing terrified by their Adverſaries,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. Indeed they will be terrible and dreadful to them. When Gods Jeruſalem is as a City that is compacted within it ſelf, when ſhe is at unity, then ſhe <hi>is terrible as an Army of Banners,</hi> Cant. 6.4.</p>
               <p>It's true indeed, that Chriſts Diſciples as they have the beſt friends, ſo they have the worſt enemies. But let them be as many and as mighty as they will, if they could but hold together, and if they were reſolved as <hi>Joab</hi> and his brother <hi>Abiſhai, If they be too ſtrong for thee, I will come and help thee; and if they be too ſtrong for me, thou ſhalt come and help me:</hi> If either of us be diſtreſſed, the other ſhall come in with all his ſuccour; If thy corruptions, or temptations, or afflictions be too ſtrong for thee, I will come and help thee with my Councels, with my Comforts, with my Prayers, and thou ſhalt deal accordingly with me. If it were thus among the Saints, they would be impregnable againſt all the Oppoſitions that Earth or Hell could make againſt them. They are built up to a ſpiritual houſe, and if they were cemented well together, no ſtorms would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw them. That is worth our obſervation, which <hi>Ferus</hi> writes of the Primitive Saints. They were wont, ſaith he, to meet together very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and there to lay open their ſeveral temptations, their means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, their gracious ſucceſs and happy deliverance: And ſo to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and to comfort, and to encourage, and confirm and ſtrengthen one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for my own part, I take very much comfort in the great unity that is to be obſerved among Gods people here in this place, and in the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:46169:174"/>
frequent meetings which they have together. It is a joyfull thing to ſee their love in the truth, and I am confident they get much ſtrength by it: while others who reſerve themſelves, refrain communion each with other, withhold their Counſels, Comforts, Prayers, are very weak by this means, and eaſie to be overcome. And therefore one obſerveth very well, upon this prayer of our Saviour in my text, that his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are preſerved and kept by unity. <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own name, and to this end let them be one as we are.</hi> As if the only way to keep them and preſerve them, were to make them one among themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is of great concernment to the furtherance of the Goſpel that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The work of Jeſus Chriſt is not to be carried on with much knocking. As in the building of the old material Temple, there were no Axes, no Hammers, nor any other Tool heard, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.7. ſo in the building of the Church of Chriſt, and carrying on the buſineſs of the Goſpel, the leſs ſtir, the leſs noiſe, the more progreſs. If there were not ſuch knocking as we have heard too much of late, this Church-work would go on the faſter, and come the ſooner to perfection. In the building of <hi>Babel,</hi> you know there was a confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo the work was wholly hindred and laid by, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.7. The workmen under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not one anothers language, and ſo were forced to deſiſt from that buſineſs. And truly there is a confuſion hapned in another ſort of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this land, the building not <hi>of Babel,</hi> but of <hi>Sion,</hi> which is a very great impediment to that work. The workmen underſtand not one another, and by this means the time which ſhould be ſpent in laying is ſpent in knocking of the ſtones and timber, in making and upholding parties, and in maintaining endleſs controverſies and diſputes which tend to ſtrife and variance and not a whit to edification. The Axe and Hammer is in uſe, but the Trowell is laid by. And verily, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, while it ſo continues, the work of Chriſt will never go forward. Religion will not thrive among us as it ſhould, till all that appertain to Chriſt, come to a nearer unity &amp; a more firm accord among themſelves. And therefore it is very notable that when our Saviour Chriſt aſcended, and meant to propagate the Goſpel, to amplifie and to enlarge the Church, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles</hi> and ſo on <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, &amp;c.</hi> Mark my beloved, when we come to unity, then the work goes on amain, then we thrive apace in knowledge, then we grow to perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then the Church of Chriſt goes up: But till the ſtones be joined cloſe together there will be no edifying, that is in Engliſh, no building.</p>
               <p>It is of great concernment to the entertainment of Chriſt Jeſus in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> the world, that his Diſciples be at neareſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they be alwayes wrangling and contending, others will not come among them. No, they will ſtand off from them, and from the Maſter which they ſerve, if he be owned and followed by none but by a company of quarrelſome contentious people. And hence is that Petition of our Saviour in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples at <hi>ver.</hi> 23. of this Chapter. In my text he
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:46169:175"/>
prayes the Father <hi>that they may be one even as the Father and himſelf were one.</hi> And in the cited verſe, he renews the ſame petition, <hi>that they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they may be one in us.</hi> And why ſo? <hi>That the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me. q. d.</hi> If my diſciples be not one among themſelves, if they be rent aſunder by a ſpirit of diviſion, the world will not believe that I came forth from thee who art the God of love and peace, that thou haſt ſent me down into the world to be a Mediator, and a Peace-maker, to make up all the breaches and the differences between thee and thy people. They will look ſtrangely upon me, and I ſhall never bring them to believe, that I am come on ſuch an errand as this is. And therefore I beſeech thee Father, that I may be entertained under the Notion of a Mediator, that the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me on this buſineſs, do thou take care that my Diſciples may be at unity among themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> It is of great concernment to the happineſs of Chriſts Diſciples that they be at neereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Among the eight beatitudes, the third in order falleth to the meek and peaceable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. And if the meek and peaceable be bleſſed, then certainly the fierce and furious are accurſed. It is a pretty obſervation of <hi>Ludolphus</hi> out of <hi>Bede</hi> on that place, Heaven is promiſed to the pure, <hi>bleſſed are the pure in ſpirit, for theirs is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven:</hi> Earth is promiſed to the meek, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth;</hi> So there remaineth nothing elſe but hell for the contentious and impure ſpirit. Ah my beloved, would we avoid the curſe, and would we be partakers of the bleſſing? would we have heaven and earth to be our portion? Let us be pure and peaceable, let us make and keep peace, and ſo the bleſſing of the God of peace will be upon us. And therefore <hi>David</hi> having broken out into a paſſionate and pithy commendation of the unity of brethren, <hi>behold how good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a thing it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! it is like pretious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 133.2. he ſhuts up all with this concluſion, <hi>There the Lord commanded the bleſsing and life for evermore.</hi> There where brethren live in unity and love, there the Lord commands bleſſing; it cannot chooſe but come upon them, for the Lord himſelf commands it.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Now to proceed to application. Is it ſo my brethren, that it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of wondrous difficulty and of great concernment for Chriſts Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be at neereſt unity among themſelves? Then let this quicken us and ſtirr us up, who would be taken to be Chriſts Diſciples, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after this oneneſs, and to endeavour to the utmoſt of our power to get and <hi>keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace.</hi> You hear it is a matter of great concernment, and therefore it is worth the ſtriving for: It is a matter of wondrous difficulty, and therefore is not to be had without ſtriving. Now I beſeech you my beloved, let us ſet our ſelves to this buſineſs. There was never greater need them now, when God hath ſuffered ſuch a ſpirit of diviſion to poſſeſs his own people. And when the members of the body myſticall of Chriſt are of ſo many minds, and draw ſo many wayes, and have ſometimes ſuch vehement and hot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:46169:175"/>
and diſputes among themſelves: So that the Church had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver greater reaſon to cry out, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> ſometimes did, when ſhe had parties in her womb, <hi>If it be ſo, why am I thus?</hi> and therefore we had need to put ſome ſpirit into this perſwaſion, and you had need to put ſome ſpirit into your endeavours, and if the Lord will put his ſpirit of unity and peace into us, it may ſubdue and overcome the ſpirit of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which reigns too much abroad in theſe times. But you will ask me, How may we attain this? and what are we to do, that we may come to be at neereſt unity among our ſelves? Though it be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as you have heard, it may be compaſſed notwithſtanding by the bleſsing of the Lord, upon the uſe of theſe directions.</p>
               <p>You muſt endeavour to the utmoſt of your power to mortifie thoſe luſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and thoſe corruptions that incline you to diſſentions. I ſhewed you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in explication of the point, that the cauſe of our diviſions is within, and not without us; They do not come ſo much from outward provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, as inward corruptions. <hi>If there were no luſts within, there would be no wars without,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> inſinuates. And verily if our corruptions, as pride, and paſsion, and ſelf-love, were throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified within, thoſe outward provocations would never cauſe ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rents and ſuch implacable contentions as they do. And therefore let us ſet our ſelves effectually and throughly to ſubdue theſe luſts of ours; though they be naturally as dear and near as the members of our bodies, let us perſue them to the very death, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes, Col. 3.5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth.</hi> Let nothing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie us, till we have the life of them. Let us not wound them only, but deſtroy them; that ought to be the Chriſtians aim, as the Apoſtle ſhews, Rom. 6.6. <hi>that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed.</hi> Our luſts ſeek our life, either they muſt dye or we. And they ſeek Gods life, <hi>Omne peccatum eſt Deicidium.</hi> And they have ſought Chriſts life, and brought him to a ſhamefull and accurſed death. And therefore let us ſeek their lives too, and never ſatisfie our ſelves till we have the blood of them. Let it be far from any of us to nouriſh or to cheriſh our corruptions, to favour them, or to deal kindly with them any way. No let us daſh this Babyloniſh brood againſt the ſtones, let us ſhew them no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; And when they are once deſtroyed, our differences and debates will end with them.</p>
               <p>As we muſt mortifie our carnal luſts, ſo we muſt chaſe away out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our hearts our carnal reaſonings that foment and nouriſh diſcords and diſſentions. For theſe, if we will give them entertainment, will ſet our hearts on fire of hell. And therefore when our thoughts begin to work apace in any injury or provocation that is offered to us, and to tell us ſtrange things, that it is not to be born, and that it may not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, let us ſmother and ſuppreſs them, let us not give place to them, no not for an hour, no not for a moment. It is obſerved of <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>when the fowls came down upon his ſacrifice, he drove them away,</hi> Gen. 15.11. ſo when ſuch foul and noiſome thoughts as theſe offer to pitch upon our heart, let them have no footing there; no, let us watch them narrowly, that we may ſuddenly chaſe them away: And
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:46169:176"/>
let us follow the advice of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.24. <hi>Let us conſider one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provoke to love.</hi> Let us conſider that, and think on that which may ſtir us up to love; let our imaginations work and dwell upon ſuch thoughts as theſe, and not thoſe which lead on to Conteſtation and Diſſention.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As we ſhould chaſe away the thoughts, ſo we ſhould avoid the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that make and nouriſh breaches and diviſions. It is the Apoſtles Counſel that we ſhould <hi>mark them that cauſe diviſions, and offences, and avoid them,</hi> Rom. 16.17. Mark them, not to join with them, but to decline them and avoid them. Brethren, you ſhall obſerve that there are ſome of all hands whoſe work it is to make peace, and to compoſe breaches. And there are others on the other ſide who are as buſie as it is poſſible for men to be, to make rents and ſeparations and diviſions. And it is our unhappineſs that theſe dividers work goes onward faſter then the others. Indeed it is an eaſie thing for one to rip faſter then two or three can ſow. Alas how many are there in theſe wrangling times, who are continually medling, and who make this their work and buſineſs, to ſee how they can ſet men one againſt another; how they can blow the coals of diſcord, and kindle them into a flame; how they can heighten the contention and the animoſity that is too high al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready among thoſe who are in name at leaſt and in profeſſion Chriſts Diſciples. Now I beſeech you my beloved, as the Apoſtle doth the Romans in the fore-alledged Scripture, <hi>Mark theſe men;</hi> let them be of what ſide they will, if they be of this ſpirit, do you ſet a mark upon them, that you may know them another time, and that you decline them, and avoid them. It is a bitter imprecation of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls,</hi> Gal. 2.12. <hi>I wiſh they were cut off that trouble you.</hi> Truly I wiſh that they who are the troublers of our <hi>Sions</hi> peace, the main and unwearied ſticklers in our Church-diviſions, who would not have things come to an accord and a friendly compoſition (for ends which they beſt know) I wiſh they were cut off from all communion with the Saints: That all the people of the Lord on all ſides would look aloof upon them, and avoid them as the peſts of this Nation. And certainly if all men would avoid them, and keep off from them, they would have the leſs work, and we ſhould have the leſs trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If we would be at neareſt unity among our ſelves, we muſt be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with abundance of that wiſdom which cometh from above, as the Apoſtle cals it, James. 3.17. <hi>For that is gentle, peaceable, eaſie to be be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits.</hi> Contentious perſons may applaud their own wits, and think themſelves extreamly wiſe and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, in making good the quarrels which they undertake: But what ſaith the Apoſtle? ver. 14. <hi>if you have bitter ſtrife and envy in your hearts, glory not, lye not againſt the truth. This wiſdom deſcendeth not from above;</hi> And if it come not from above, from heaven, it cometh from beneath, from earth, from hell, it is <hi>earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh.</hi> What ever mens abilities, or parts, or reaches are, if they be alwayes quarrelling and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, as many are, it is apparent that they want this bleſſed wiſdom. To ſay the truth, my brethren, it is want of wit that is much of the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:46169:176"/>
cauſe of all this: <hi>Anger reſteth in the boſom of fools;</hi> and ſo the wiſe man tells us, <hi>that every fool will be medling,</hi> Prov. 20.3. It is an honor for a man to ceaſe from ſtrife, but every fool will be medling. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of every fool to do ſo.</p>
               <p>You have a ſort of men, my Brethren, that will be at the end of every quarrel. If there be any difference or ſtrife near them, they will be ſure to have a finger in the pie, they will never ſit out. Now would you know what kind of men theſe are? They are a company of fools, a company of buſie medling fools; and were it not for ſuch Idiots we might have much more peace then we have at this day. If men were ballaſted with wiſdom, they would not be a tempering and a making va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance as they do: And if indignities and wrongs were offered to them, they would eaſily digeſt them, and poſſeſs their ſouls in patience; and therefore let us labour after this wiſdom, and let us follow the adviſe and counſel of our Saviour, Mar. 9 50. <hi>Have ſalt in your ſelves, and have peace one with another.</hi> Firſt let us have the ſalt of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in our ſelves, and then we ſhall have unity and peace with others.</p>
               <p>If we would be one, and if we would have peace the bleſſing, we muſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be under the commanding and the ruling power of peace the vertue: It muſt ſit upon the throne in our hearts, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, Col. 3.15. <hi>Let the peace of God rule in your hearts.</hi> Brethren, when you are any way exaſperated or provoked, ſo that your paſſions riſe or ſwell, and are ready to break out into intemperate words or actions, when you are hardly able to contain your ſelves, then let the ruling power of peace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by ſtilling and compoſing all again: And let this holy diſpoſition be ſo ſtrong within you, that neither pride, nor wrath, nor malice, nor any other luſt may be able to controll it. There is a ſtory that the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> had a Law among them, that in a fray where ſwords were drawn, if a woman or a child did cry but peace a great way of, they were bound to end the quarrel, or elſe he died that ſtruck the next ſtroke after peace was named. So if your paſſions be at war within you, (to uſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles phraſe) if they be up in arms, and you do but think of peace, or any friend perſwade to peace, let all be huſht and quiet preſently, and let that paſſion die, let it be crucified that dares to ſtir when peace is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: So let the peace of God rule in our hearts, let it triumph in all, and over all our provocations, that we may bear them all with an unmoved and undiſturbed ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Let us be earneſt with the Lord in prayer, that he would make and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> keep us one among our ſelves: All other means that we can uſe will be of no avail at all, unleſs the Lord himſelf ſtrike in, and interpoſe in this buſineſs. He is the donor and diſpenſer of this rare and pretious bleſſing; and therefore he is called <hi>the God of peace;</hi> It is a name that he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in, and therefore it is often uſed; and he is ſtiled <hi>the God of peace,</hi> not only becauſe he is formally ſo (if this expreſſion be allowable) for <hi>Primum bonum ſummae Trinitatis eſt indiviſio,</hi> but becauſe he is effective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, becauſe he is the Author of peace, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 Cor. 14.33. <hi>For God is not the Author of confuſion, but of peace: And he makes
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:46169:177"/>
wars to ceaſe,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 46.11. he breaks the bow, and cuts the ſpear aſunder: And therefore the Apoſtle begs this peace of God in ſuch a manner, as if it were to be obtained no where elſe, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of his Father in my Text, <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own Name, that they may be one as we are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then, my Brethren, let us go to him for this bleſſing, let us not only ſtrive for peace in the uſe of other means which have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly propoſed, but let us pray for peace; ſo eſpecially for the peace of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Oh let us pray, and pray hard for Church peace, for peace among Chriſts Diſciples, among Gods own people, for there he uſes to beſtow it: <hi>My peace I leave with you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, and God will give his people the bleſſing of peace. Oh let us beg him now in theſe divided diſtracted times, to give this bleſſing to his own people; that though <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be not at unity, neither can be at unity with thoſe that are without, yet ſhe may be at unity with thoſe that are within, that ſhe may be at unity within her ſelf; and to this end let us deſire eſpecially two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God himſelf would govern all his own people, that he would rule them, and command them ſo, that they may not break the peace. By nature we are all of us inclined to diviſions, deſtruction and unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in our ways, <hi>and the way of peace we have not known:</hi> And if the Lord himſelf ſhould not appeaſe thoſe raging and tempeſtuous waves that are ſo apt to riſe and ſwell, if he ſhould not extinguiſh and put out the fire that is ſo apt to kindle in the hearts of men, yea of the beſt men, the world would flame with nothing elſe but diſcords and diſſentions: And therefore let us earneſtly beſeech the Lord to do the work which none but he alone is able to perform. To rule and over-rule the hearts (at leaſt of his own people) and by his Kingly power to maſter and keep down thoſe raging paſſions that are ſo apt to riſe and ſwell, to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of the Churches peace; when his houſhold are together by the ears, when they are in a tumult and combuſtion, let us entreat him to come in among them, and he will quickly make them ſtill as Lambs, all will be huſht and quiet preſently. It is his own moſt gratious promiſe, and therefore we may urge it with the greater confidence, that he <hi>will make the Wolf and Lamb to dwell together,</hi> &amp;c. That he will quiet the tempeſtuous hearts of men, and make them tame: So that how furious and how fierce ſoever they were formerly by nature, yet they ſhall be ſo meek and gentle now, that they ſhall yeild to any admonition or perſwaſion, <hi>yea a little child ſhall lead them,</hi> Iſa. 11.6. How weak ſoever he may ſeem to be, he ſhall prevail and over-rule them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God himſelf would teach all his own people, and the effect of this would be a ſtrange agreement, and a ſweet accord among them, even beyond imagination. One cauſe why they that are profeſſed, and are it may be real Saints, agree no better; and why there are ſuch breaches, and ſuch rents among them, is, becauſe they are not all of them, at leaſt in all things, taught of God. Some of them in ſome particulars at leaſt, are taught of men, and not of God, and other ſome are taught of God. And they that are taught of men, will not agree with them
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:46169:177"/>
that are taught of God; and they that are taught of God, cannot agree with them that are taught of men; and ſo they are continually wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and contending, and contradicting one another, they can never fadge together: But now when God ſhall come to teach them all in every thing, then they ſhall think and ſpeak the ſame things, then they ſhall quarrel and conteſt no more, but they ſhall all of them agree, and live in unity and love together.</p>
               <p>And therefore let us earneſtly beſeech the Lord to do this, to leave his children now no longer out at School, but ſpeedily to fetch them home, and to teach them all himſelf. That being all of one School, under one chief Maſter, and ſome Uſhers under him, they may be all taught one way, and ſo may all agree together. We have the promiſe of the Lord for this too, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. Oh let us urge it hard upon him in ſuch times as theſe are; <hi>All thy children ſhall be taught of God,</hi> and mark what follows preſently, <hi>great ſhall be the peace of thy children;</hi> Here is a time for ſuch a promiſe to be put in ſuit, and therefore let us preſs it home, let us take no nay. Let the Lord have no reſt, till he teach all his own children, and then he will have a great School, and we ſhall have great peace.</p>

               <p>THE words now read are part of the Lords Prayer, not of the Lords Prayer which he taught us, but as I ſhewed in the beginning, of the Lords Prayer which he made for us: Not that which he propounded to us as our pattern, but that which he preſented for us as our priviledge; at leaſt for his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and in them for us alſo. In which have been conſidered two things: The matter of it, and the reaſons of it. The things which Chriſt deſires in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples: And then the arguments with which he preſſeth and enforceth his deſire: The matter of it, or the thing which he deſireth in the behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, is preſervation; <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own Name,</hi> which we have fully ended and diſpatched.</p>
               <p>And now we are arrived at the reaſons of the prayer, the arguments with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth this deſire of his. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the firſt is taken from his own effectual preſervation of them, during the time that he had been among them; and therefore he would have his Father keep them now, becauſe he himſelf had kept them very ſafe till now. <hi>While I was with them in the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I kept them, and none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition:</hi> And now I am even ready to withdraw my corporal and fleſhly preſence from them, and therefore I beſeech thee Father, take them into thy tuition, receive them into thy eſpecial cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and care; I had them from thee, and here I render and reſign them up again ſafe, and whole, and ſound to thee; I pray thee Father, keep them henceforward, as well as I have done to this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:46169:178"/>This paſſage of our Saviour hath two conſiderable things in it; a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral profeſſion, and a particular exception. Firſt you have here a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral profeſſion, that he had ſafely and entirely kept all thoſe that were beſtowed upon him by his Father; <hi>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name, thoſe that thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> And then you have a particular exception of <hi>Judas,</hi> who here is ſtiled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the ſon of perdition.</hi> An Hebrew manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that is, <hi>perditioni deſtinatus &amp; devotus,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> reads it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated and devoted to perdition. <hi>None of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition,</hi> who was deſigned and appointed to deſtruction. He is loſt, and he only.</p>
               <p>In the general profeſſion and aſſertion of our Saviour, I ſhall deſire you to take notice with me of theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> whom he kept; in whoſe behalf he kept them; and how long he kept them. Firſt whom he kept; thoſe who were beſtowed upon him by the donation of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, only thoſe, and all thoſe; <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them is loſt:</hi> Secondly, in whoſe behalf he kept them, in his Fathers. As he had them from the Father, ſo he kept them as the Fathers, <hi>I kept them in thy Name,</hi> ſaith he; though they were made over to him by a deed of gift, he kept them notwithſtanding in his Fathers Name, and not in his own. He keep them as his Fathers goods, and as a ſervant in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his Father. As if he ſhould have told the world, they are my Fathers, and for him I keep them. Thirdly, how long he kept them; <hi>while I was with them in the world,</hi> ſaith he; He ſpeaks as if he were in heaven already, becauſe the time of his departure was at hand, he was as good as gone into the boſom of the Father, <hi>while I was with them in the world I kept them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But did he keep them no longer then he was with them in the world? No, my Beloved, no longer in the way that he intends: No longer as God manifeſted in the fleſh, and in a viſible, and corporal, and fleſhly way; and therefore in the verſe before which I have finiſhed, he yeelds them up to the tuition of the God-head, and addeth this immediately; <hi>while I was with them</hi> (conceive it corporally) <hi>in the world, I kept them in thy Name, thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> You ſee, my Brethren, here are many weighty things, if I ſhould undertake to handle all, I ſhould over-graſp my ſelf, and let fall more then I ſhould hold. And therefore I ſhall faſten on the firſt particular obſerved, which though it be not firſt in place, and in the order of the words, yet it is firſt in reaſon to be handled: Whom our Saviour kept; and they, as you have heard, were thoſe that were beſtowed upon him by the Father; <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them is loſt;</hi> and here the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies before us.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> Chriſt hath been wont to keep them ſafe who are beſtowed upon him by the Father.</head>
                  <p>Thoſe whom the Father gives him, he is ſure to keep: So he did when he was converſant upon the earth among them; and ſo he doth now he is reſident in heaven; for <hi>he is yeſterday and to day the ſame for ever:</hi> Then indeed he kept them one way, and now he keeps them in another; then he was with them to preſerve them in a viſible and fleſhly way, by the preſence of his body: Now he is with them to preſerve them in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and ſpiritual way, by the preſence of his Spirit: And however in the verſe immediately before my Text he reſigns them to the Father, as if he meant to take no further charge of them; that Father, my Beloved, is the whole God-head, of which himſelf as God makes one Perſon: For Jeſus Chriſt as he is man, is not the Son of the firſt Perſon of the God-head only, but of all the three Perſons. And in my text he ſpeaks as man, for he ſpeaks in prayer here; and prayer is part of worſhip, and God doth not worſhip God. And therefore when as man he yeelds up his Diſciples to the Father (his Man-hood being now to be withdrawn) he yeelds them to the whole God-head, which is the Father of the Son as he is Man: And conſequently Jeſus Chriſt as Man, reſigns them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as God aſwell as to the other two Perſons; and ſo in that capacity he keeps them to this day, and wil do ſo to the worlds end. Still you ſee he keeps them ſafe who are beſtowed upon him by the Father.</p>
                  <p>Now to evince and clear the point, I ſhall diſpatch theſe two things. Firſt I ſhall ſhew you that, and how, the Father gives men to the Son. And then in what reſpects, and how far forth the Son preſerves and keeps them ſafe who are thus beſtowed upon him by the Father.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, that ſome there are, ſome certain choice ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ones, whom God the Father in a ſpecial manner gives to Jeſus Chriſt, this is apparent in the Text; <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept;</hi> Indeed, originally all the world, and all the people in it, appertain to God; his they are, for he made them: So that if Jeſus Chriſt, as he is Man, have any people, it muſt be by donation from the Father: And therefore he is often ſaid to give men to the Son in the Scripture, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the New Teſtament, according to his promiſe in the old, Pſal. 2.7. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance.</hi> And yet you muſt not apprehend that he doth ſo beſtow them on the Son, that he doth utterly deveſt himſelf of all his intereſt, and wholly paſs away his right in them: No, my Beloved, the Father gives men to the Son, juſt as a great Sheep-maſter gives his ſheep unto his Shepherd, to keep them and to look to them, to ſave them and anſwer them again: So Jeſus Chriſt who is the ſervant of the Father (as he calls him, Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant</hi>) receives men from him under that notion: And therefore he is ſaid to keep them in his Fathers Name, and as his Fathers
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46169:179"/>
goods, as a ſhepherd and a ſervant to his Father. It is his own expreſſion in my Text, <hi>While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy Name; thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them is loſt.</hi> They are his, you ſee, to keep them, not to ſell them or to loſe them; for he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways anſwerable for them to the Father. Now in this ſenſe the Father gives men to the Son, eſpecially in two reſpects.</p>

In the firſt place he gives men to him by election; and this he doth from everlaſting; He picks out ſuch a certain company of men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows them upon Chriſt in regard of the decree. There are a people for thee, ſaith the Father to the Son: So many thou ſhalt have among the <hi>Iews;</hi> and if that be not ſufficient, thou ſhalt have as many more as thou wilt ask among the <hi>Gentiles; Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> Pſal. 2.7. And therefore God is ſaid <hi>to chooſe us in the Son,</hi> Eph. 1.4. as in our Head, and as by deſignation members of his body. He doth not chooſe us firſt, and then after chooſe Chriſt; No, he chooſes Chriſt firſt; he is his firſt and chief Elect, and then he chooſes as in him, appoints us to belong to him. It were unnatural the feet ſhould firſt come out of the womb before the head; and therefore God obſerves this method; Firſt Chriſt the Head comes forth out of the womb of his Decree, and then the others follow. Firſt he electeth Chriſt to be the head of his Church, and then he electeth us to be the members of his body. And hence perhaps is that expreſſion of our Saviours to the Father, <hi>a body haſt thou prepared me, or fitted me,</hi> as it is rendred in the Margent, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>viz.</hi> in thy Predeſtination: Thou haſt not only choſen me to be a Head, but in and by the fame decree thou haſt prepared a body for me. Thou haſt culled out a certain company of men, whom thou haſt preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to belong to me, whom thou haſt choſen as it were in me, and whom thou haſt beſtowed upon me to be members of my body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the Father gives men to the Son by the decree, ſo more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly by the execution and accompliſhment of the decree; as he beſtows men on our Saviour by election, ſo further yet by actual union and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation. In the firſt he aſſigns them, in the ſecond he delivers them, when he takes thoſe very men whom he had preordained from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and puts them into Jeſus Chriſt: There, ſaith the Father, are the members which I appointed for thee from Eternity. So that now the Son receives them, and hath them in his own poſſeſſion. And he may ſay to God the Father as the Prophet doth, <hi>Here am I, and the people which thou haſt given me. Thine they were</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. They have been thine, I muſt acknowledge; but now the property is altered, they are mine. Why, which way came you by them? might the Father ſay. The Son replies, By thy donation, by thy own free gift; <hi>Thine they were, and thou haſt given them to me,</hi> as it is added in the next words. So then you ſee, my Brethren, that, and how, the Father gives men to the Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now for the ſecond thing propoſed, in what reſpects and how far forth the Son preſerves and keeps them ſafe, who are thus beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him by the Father, This will need a little opening, becauſe indeed there is ſome difficulty in it. And that you may the better underſtand
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:46169:179"/>
it, I ſhall ſhew you in the firſt place, how far our Saviour doth not keep them, who are thus beſtowed upon him. And in the ſecond place how far he doth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth not keep them that they do not ſuffer. Though Chriſt be with his own Diſciples in the Ship, there may be a ſtorm upon it, and a very dangerous one. They may be under heavy tryals, and afflictions, both within them and without them. Chriſt may expoſe them, though they be his own, to bitter perſecutions in the world; yea to the greateſt miſeries that humane cruelties can deviſe to inflict. And when in the extremity of their diſtreſſes they run crying to him, as they are about to ſink, <hi>Maſter ſave us we periſh,</hi> Chriſt may ſeem to be aſleep, to wink at all this miſery of theirs, to make as if he knew nothing, and as if he did not dream of the intolerable preſſures that lye upon his poor people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth not keep them that they do not ſin; and that moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly, ſometimes with hideous circumſtantial aggravations. How fearfully have many fallen, who have indeed belong'd to Jeſus Chriſt? We have very ſad examples of it in the Scripture. <hi>Peter</hi> was one of them, concerning whom our Saviour tells his Father in my text, <hi>thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept.</hi> And indeed he prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> in a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, <hi>that his faith might never fail,</hi> that it might not wholly fail, ſo as to be quite loſt and utterly extinct in him. Yet after this you know, he fearfully ſinned notwithſtanding, ſo as in ſome reſpect to deny the Lord that bought him; and that in a ſtupendious way, with dreadfull Oaths, yea, more then ſo, with bitter curſes, and direfull im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations too. What ſin almoſt may not Chriſt leave a perſon to commit, whom he hath taken into his tuition?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But now my brethren, in the third place, though Chriſt do not keep them that they do not ſuffer, and though he do not keep them that they do not ſin, who are beſtowed upon him by his Father, both by election and incorporation: yet he doth keep them that they do not periſh. All that are ſo beſtowed upon him he keeps ſo that they are not loſt, as you have it in my text, <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me, I kept</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and none of them is loſt.</hi> They may ſuffer grievouſly, their ſufferings may deprive them of the life of nature, but they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the life of grace. They may be perſecuted, but they cannot be forſaken totally and finally. They may be caſt down, but they cannot be deſtroyed, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. They may be deſtroyed as men, but they can never be deſtroyed as Saints. In this reſpect they are like Mount <hi>Sion</hi> that can never be removed. The wind may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> drive away the chaff; but all the ſtorms of perſecution ſhall never blow away one grain of good wheat.</p>
                  <p>So they may ſin exceedingly, but they can never ſin to death. Any ſin they may commit (if you reſpect the matter of it, for of that I ſpeak, not of the manner of Commiſsion) but that againſt that Holy Ghoſt. <hi>There is a ſin to death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. to death, not in the merit of it only (for ſo is every ſin to death if we look to the deſert) but to death, in the event, ſo that eternal death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:46169:180"/>
is the infallible and unavoidable effect and iſſue of it. And this Chriſt ſurely keeps his people from, ſo that they never fall into it. <hi>He gives his ſheep eternal life, and they do never periſh,</hi> as himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. And though they be not kept in all reſpects to preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either from ſinning, or from ſuffering, yet they are kept unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, notwithſtanding both theſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee the point is clear, that Jeſus Chriſt doth keep them ſafe who are beſtowed upon him by his Father, in the ſenſe before expreſt. Not ſafe from ſinning and from ſuffering, but ſafe from loſing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their afflictions, whatever their trangreſsions be. <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me, I kept,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and none of them is loſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </label> But you will interrupt me with our Saviours own exception in the very next words, <hi>but the Son of perdition; none of them is loſt but the Son of perdition,</hi> ſo that one of them was loſt who was beſtowed upon him by the Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>To this ſome anſwer, that the particle But is not <hi>exceptive,</hi> but <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitative,</hi> and ſo doth not at all imply that <hi>Iudas</hi> was beſtowed upon our Saviour by the Father. <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of them, no not one of them is loſt.</hi> But as for <hi>Judas,</hi> he indeed is gone, being none of that number. He is not given to me by election, but is indeed <hi>the Son of perdition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if it be allowed to be exceptive, and ſo that <hi>Judas</hi> was in ſome reſpect beſtowed upon our Saviour by the Father, it will not follow that he was ſo beſtowed upon him as the reſt were. Indeed the Father gave him <hi>Judas</hi> for outward Miniſtration as the reſt of the Apoſtles, but not for inward union and incorporation as the reſt. He gave him <hi>Judas</hi> for a Servant as the reſt, not for a member as the reſt; he was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon our Saviour by election as the reſt, for he was a reprobate, and therefore <hi>called the Son of perdition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why then doth Chriſt except him? Becauſe he was in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect beſtowed upon him as the reſt, and for ought appeared then in all reſpects. And therefore though our Saviour Chriſts exception be improper, as to the Grammar of the words, as <hi>Calvin</hi> very well obſerves upon the Text, yet it is not improper as to the ſence of thoſe that heard him. For any thing that they were able to diſcover, he was as much beſtowed on Chriſt, as any of the reſt of the Apoſtles. And therefore though this [but] might have been ſpared, if all things had been rightly underſtood, yet it was very neceſſary with reſpect to them who thought far better of that hypocrite then he deſerved. <hi>None of them is loſt</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>but</hi> he who though he be accounted for the preſent of the number, yet he is indeed and will in time appear to be <hi>the Son of perdition.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Now is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt doth keep them ſafe who are beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him by the Father? They are exceedingly miſtaken then who hold and teach, that Chriſt may and doth often loſe thoſe whom the Father gives him: And that not only for outward Miniſtration, but even for inward union and incorporation; That he that is in Chriſt to day, may be out of Chriſt to morrow; That he that is elect to day,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:46169:180"/>
may be reprobate to morrow; that he that is to day an heir of ſalvation, may be to morrow a child of perdition.</p>
                  <p>A Doctrine infinitely prejudicial to the honour of our Saviour, as if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he were regardleſs of that which is beſtowed upon him by his Father, and looked upon it as not worth the keeping. As if he were unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the truſt that is repoſed in him by the Father. He commits a people to him to be kept and ſaved by him. The Father doth it to this very end, that <hi>he may give eternal life to as many as he hath given him,</hi> John 17.2. And what doth Jeſus Chriſt abandon them to ruine and deſtruction notwithſtanding? No, my beloved: mark what <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaith, John 3.35. <hi>The Father loves the Son,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and hath given all things into his hands;</hi> you muſt conceive it, all things of one ſort he hath beſtowed upon him; ſo that he hath put them into his hand, to honour them and to keep and preſerve them: all his elect and choſen people: for all things of another ſort he hath (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) put under his feet to tread upon them and to ruine and deſtroy them. But what doth Jeſus Chriſt with thoſe his Father gives him in the former way? why as his Father would he ſhould do: he keeps them and <hi>he gives eternal life to them,</hi> as it is added in the next verſe. Yea they <hi>have everlaſting life</hi> (as that is the expreſſion there) they have it in the preſent world in regard of inchoation, and are as ſure of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it in the world to come, as if they had it in their own poſſeſſion. And to affirm that ſuch may periſh and be loſt for ever, is to make the Son of God unfaithfull to the Father, which is a horrid derogation.</p>
                  <p>Or if not ſo, at leaſt unable to preſerve them from deſtruction; Save them he would, but it is not in his power. Whereas the Apoſtle tell us that <hi>he is able to ſave his people to the utmoſt,</hi> Heb. 7.25. And he himſelf who is the truth it ſelf affirms, that none ſhall pluck them out of his hand, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. The world would, the devil would, the fleſh would, many would, but none ſhall. He hath power to overtop them and to maſter and controul them, ſo that they ſhall not have their will in this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>And as this Doctrine, that they may be loſt whom God the Father <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> gives to Jeſus Chriſt, is very prejudicial to the honour of our Saviour, ſo to the comfort of his poor people. Alas, my brethren, what ſolid and enduring comfort will the beſt condition that they can be in, afford them, if they be not ſure to keep it? Suppoſe <hi>they give all diligence to make their calling and election ſure;</hi> yea, ſuppoſe they make it ſure; Though they be ſure they are elect, they are not ſure they ſhall continue ſo; by this doctrine, they may be reprobates to morrow; ſuppoſe they prove themſelves whether they be in Chriſt or no; Suppoſe they prove they be in Chriſt; they cannot prove they ſhall continue ſo; by this doctrine, they may be out of Chriſt to morrow. And is not this cold comfort? Ah my beloved, how will it ſting the ſoul that is about to take her flight for another world to be at ſuch uncertainty, when all the conſolation ſhe can have is only this, that for the preſent ſhe belongs to Chriſt, but the next hour before ſhe get away out of the world, he may loſe her and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own her, and ſo ſhe is undone for ever.</p>

Believe it, you can never periſh, be your afflictions, or temptations, or corruptions what they will, or what they can: depend upon it, you are ſafe as to the main. If you belong to Jeſus Chriſt, he hath undertaken for you to the Father, and he will ſee that you ſhall not miſcarry. Let the fleſh, and let the world, and let the Devil pluck at you with all their power, and might, it is in vain; they ſhall not get you off from Jeſus Chriſt. They may pluck you, and pluck you violently in his hand, but they ſhall never pluck you out of his hand: No, my Beloved; he that hath received you from the Father, will be ſure to anſwer you ſafe and ſound to him again: And in the great day of account, he will bring you forth and ſay, Here am I, and the people which thou haſt given me: <hi>Thoſe which thou gaveſt me, I kept, and not one of them is loſt.</hi> Indeed, my Brethren, if your preſervation depended on your own care, ſtrength, abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you were in very great hazard: But ſeeing this depends upon the care and power, and faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, what can be added to your ſafety? Now the better to aſſure you, &amp; ſettle you in this particular, I ſhall lay down a few particulars as an immoveable foundation, upon which this comfortable truth is built, that Chriſt will ſurely keep them ſafe who are beſtowed upon him by the Father. And they are of three ſorts. Either ſuch as reſpect the Father who beſtows a people on the Son; or ſuch as reſpect the Son on whom this people are beſtowed; or ſuch as reſpect the people who by the Father are beſtowed upon the Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe, you may be ſure that Chriſt will keep you ſafe, if you have been beſtowed upon him by the Father; out of love, and out of duty to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Firſt he will keep you out of love to God the Father: What do you think that Chriſt will loſe that which his Father gives him? we would not loſe the gift but of an ordinary friend, eſpecially if he be dear to us, as I have noted heretofore, and much leſs would we loſe a Fathers gift; we would keep ſuch a thing with all the care and diligence we can. Now Jeſus Chriſt loves his Father better then we can love ours; and therefore as he had us from the Father, ſo he will ſurely keep us for the Fathers ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:46169:181"/>Secondly, As he will keep us out of love ſo out of duty to the Father; For as Man and Mediator he is a ſervant to the Father; And as the Father hath beſtowed a people on him, ſo he hath given him an expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to keep them, and he hath given him ample power that he may keep them: And conſequently Jeſus Chriſt will certainly preſerve them, out of duty to the Father: in reference to his injunction that he may not diſobey him: in reference to his intention and expectation, that he may not diſappoint to him.</p>
                  <p>Firſt in reference to the injunction of the Father, Chriſt will ſurely keep us that he may not diſobey him. For you muſt know, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that the Father, as he hath given us to Jeſus Chriſt, ſo he hath withall commanded him to look to us, and to ſee we do not periſh. <hi>This is the Fathers will,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that of all which he hath given me, I ſhould loſe nothing,</hi> Joh. 6.39. And he came down into this lower world to do the will of him that ſent him. And therefore certainly he will be very careful of this ſpecial charge of his: he will obſerve it very ſtrictly and exactly. He will be infinitely wary that he loſe nothing of the Fathers goods, which he hath given him to keep, and required him to keep, that ſo he may approve himſelf a faithful ſervant.</p>
                  <p>Secondly in reference to the intention of the Father, Jeſus Chriſt will ſurely keep us, that he may not diſappoint him: For as he hath received a ſtrict command, ſo he hath withall received full and ample power to keep us: His Father hath beſtowed it on him to this very end, as himſelf acknowledges, Joh. 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he might give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him,</hi> and conſequently that they might not periſh: So that this is the Fathers aim, you ſee, which Jeſus Chriſt will never fruſtrate; he hath beſtowed upon him large authority and power to this purpoſe: Power over all fleſh that he may give eternal life to ſome fleſh, to as many as God hath given him. Indeed if he were only veſted with authority and power over that fleſh which God intends that he ſhall keep and ſave, it would fall ſhort in this buſineſs; For there is other fleſh that would reſiſt and hinder our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is fleſh within us, I mean our luſts and our corruptions; and there is fleſh without us, I mean the world and worldly men that would oppoſe this great work; and therefore God hath qualified Jeſus Chriſt with power ſufficient to reach his end in this deſign of his. He hath not only veſted him with power over the fleſh to which he means that he ſhould give eternal life: <hi>But he hath given him power over all fleſh, that he may give eternal life to as many as he hath given him;</hi> that other fleſh may not reſiſt him and diſappoint him in this great buſineſs; and therefore let the fleſh without us, and let the fleſh within ſtruggle, we may be confident that we ſhall have eternal life, in ſpite of all their oppoſition: For God hath veſted Jeſus Chriſt with full power, to this end, and to this purpoſe, that he may give it, and that none may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
                  <p>As Jeſus Chriſt will ſurely keep us for his Fathers ſake, ſo he will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> keep us for his own ſake, and for the property and intereſt which he himſelf hath in us; For you muſt know, my Brethren, that we are not
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:46169:182"/>
nakedly entruſted with our Saviour as a ſervant, in which reſpect he is engaged to keep us out of duty; but more then ſo, we are beſtowed upon him as a Son, in which reſpect he is engaged to keep us out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and this is that which makes us ſafe indeed. If Jeſus Chriſt were but an hireling, and if the ſheep were not his own, he might leave them as a prey to the devouring and ravening Wolf, as he himſelf informs us in that ſame Similitude, Joh. 10.12. <hi>The hireling flees and leaves the ſheep, becauſe the ſheep are not his own, and cares not for the ſheep, and the Wolf catcheth and ſcattereth the ſheep.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt is not the Shepherd only, but the owner of the ſheep; he keeps them not for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but for love, and for the property he hath in them, and therefore certainly he will be careful of them to the utmoſt. Thoſe whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives him, he will keep: Indeed they are the Sons portion, <hi>The Lords portion is his people,</hi> Deut. 32.9. And what follows? <hi>He kept them as the Apple of his Eye.</hi> What do you think that Jeſus Chriſt will loſe his portion which his Father gives him? That he will be ſo wretchleſs, that he will not keep his own? his own goods: Nay, more then ſo; his own members, the very apples of his Eye. Will he ſuffer men or Devils to rent away his limbs from him, to pluck his very eyes out of his head? take this and take all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We may be ſure that Jeſus Chriſt will keep us ſafe, who are beſtowed upon him by his Father, as for his Fathers ſake, and for his own ſake, ſo for our ſakes too: And that upon a double reckoning or account. For firſt of all we coſt him dear; and ſecondly, we are very dear to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We coſt him dear; he paid a great price for us, and therefore he will know how he goes from us. We coſt him prayers; he hath not one of us among the Gentiles without asking: <hi>Ask of me, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance,</hi> ſaith the Father to the Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. Otherwiſe I will not. Chriſt is faign to beg for us before he gets us of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Nay, more then ſo, we did not coſt him breath only, but we coſt him blood too; <hi>He is the Lord that bought us,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls him, and bought us not with gold and ſilver, and ſuch corruptible things, <hi>but with his own moſt pretious blood,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.19. And if he loſe us in the end, he hath a very ill bargain. No, my Beloved, we may reſt upon it, that Jeſus Chriſt will never ſuffer the purchaſe of his prayers the purchaſe of his blood to periſh; he never ſpent his breath, and much leſs will he ſpend his blood in vain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as we coſt him dear, ſo we are very dear to him: His heart is infinitely ſet upon his Church and people; he loves them out of all meaſure, ſo that you may be ſure he will be loth to ſee them periſh. He looks upon them as his Jewels, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.17. and as his own peculiar trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.4. And he will keep his Treaſure and his Jewels ſafe, take his traſh who will.</p>
                  <p>And thus you have ſeen the grounds, on which you may be confident, that if the Father have beſtowed you on the Son, he will not loſe you; No, you are ſafe enough, depend upon it; it is impoſſible that you ſhould ever periſh, or miſcarry.</p>

                     <hi>This Doctrine ſerves to make men negligent, and careleſs, and ſecure; For if they be preſerved and kept ſo abſolutely ſafe by Chriſt, they need to take no care to keep themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwer, let it be conſidered, 1.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> That Chriſt doth keep men by themſelves. And hence ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> This is Religion for a man <hi>to keep himſelf unſpotted of the world,</hi> James 1.27. And <hi>Paul</hi> adviſes <hi>Timothy to keep himſelf pure,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.22. And 2. if any of you who belong to Chriſt, remit your watch and grow ſecure, and neglect to keep your ſelves, though Chriſt will not loſe you, yet you may loſe Chriſt as the Church did when ſhe lay upon her bed, and would not open, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.6. You may be wofully deſerted by him both in regard of grace and peace: And though you cannot fall away, yet you may fall moſt fearfully to the diſhonor of the Lord, and of Religion, and the irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wounding of your Names while you have a day to live. Though you cannot wholly loſe the inward habits of your graces, yet you may loſe the exerciſe of them. And though you cannot loſe the Eſſence, yet you may loſe the ſenſe and comfort of all the graces that you have: Though it be utterly impoſſible that you ſhould periſh in reality, yet you may periſh in your own conceit and apprehenſion; you may be brought to ſuch a ſad condition, that you may look upon your ſelves as repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and caſt-aways, and think your ſelves undone creatures: And though Chriſt will not ſuffer you to go to hell, yet he may make you cry in your heart and in your bones, as <hi>David</hi> did, and ſet you on the rack of ſuch unutterable agonies, and horrors and affrightments, that you may feel a Hell in this world.</p>
                  <p>Now for a laſt uſe of the Point, this may afford a ſeaſonable admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <label type="milestone">

                  <p n="1">1. Miniſters are Chriſts Shepherds in the Church, as Chriſt is the Fathers Shepherd; and as the Father commits his people to the Son to keep, ſo Chriſt commits them to his under-Officers, and to his Miniſters to keep; and therefore it concerneth them to hearken to the advice of the Apoſtle to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Act. 20.28. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to all the flock over which Jeſus Chriſt hath made you Over-ſeers to feed the Church of Chriſt, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood;</hi> yea, to the admonition of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf to <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 21.15.

your hands: Oh let it not be ſaid of you that you do not <hi>Cuſtodire gregem ſed perdere, non paſcere ſed mactare.</hi> Not keep the ſheep but loſe them; not feed the flock, but feed upon it: Be ſure that you be faithful to your great truſt, that you may give up your account with joy; and that when Chriſt ſhall call you to a reckoning, you may ſay to him, as he doth to his Father in my Text, and ſay it truly, <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me to keep I kept, and not one of them is loſt</hi> by my means.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. So Magiſtrates are Chriſts ſervants, his Shepherds in the Common-wealth, as they are called 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.17. And they muſt learn to keep them ſafe who are committed to them to be kept as Chriſt doth. They muſt be very careful of the ſheep of Chriſt that none of them miſcarry in their hands. And to this end they muſt do two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They muſt chaſe away the Wolves, that ſeek to prey upon the ſheep of Chriſt: The Wolves that prey upon their perſons or eſtates. Theſe you muſt either make to fly, or break their jaws, as <hi>Job</hi> did, and pluck the prey out of their teeth. The Wolves that prey upon their ſouls, that bring in ſoul-deſtroying errors, <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. There are ſome errors which whoſoever holds them and continues in them, <hi>ſuffers loſs, but he himſelf is ſaved,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.15. But there are others in which if any man continue, he himſelf is loſt for ever. Now they that bring in thoſe, deſtroy the ſheep of Chriſt: and therefore they that keep his ſheep, muſt take courſe with ſuch, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Law of God and Man hath put into their hands.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They muſt be very tender of the ſheep of Chriſt, which he hath given them to keep, as <hi>David</hi> was; <hi>Alas thoſe ſheep, what evil have they done?</hi> And as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was, who, as a Type of Chriſt, is ſtiled <hi>a hiding place from winde, and a covert from the Tempeſt,</hi> Iſa. 32.2. where the poor ſheep might fly for ſhelter, in a ſtorm, and there find ſure refuge. Now I beſeech you honorable and reſpected,<note place="margin">Preached at the Aſſizes.</note> who are the Miniſters of Chriſt, be you ſuch to his people; Let them have protection from you, let them be kept ſafe by you: Oh do not ſee them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured and undone, if you can help them. Oh do not ſee them loſt if you can ſave them: Keep them as you deſire that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould keep you; let thoſe who will aſſuredly find favour at the laſt day, at the bar of Jeſus Chriſt, find favour at your bar now. I ſpeak not this that you ſhould boulſter any out in any evil; God forbid; but that you ſhould be very careful that thoſe who appertain to Chriſt, be not ſo far neglected by you, as to be over-born unjuſtly and malitiouſly by thoſe who are the enemies of Chriſt and them, Oh be a covert and a hiding place to ſuch. Make them aſhamed who report (I hope untruly) that many times an honeſt man finds leſs reſpect and countenance then an enemy of Chriſt. And in a word, in all your actings, and adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, have a careful eye upon the little flock of Jeſus Chriſt, to fence it, and to mound it, and ſafe-guard it, that no damage come to it: that when the Stewardſhip is out, and the counting time is come, you may not be dejected, and hang down your heads, but may appear before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his glory with exceeding joy: that you may rejoyce in Chriſt, and Chriſt may rejoyce in you, to ſee how well and faithfully you have demeaned your ſelves in his ſervice.</p>

               <p>Proceed we now to his particular exception of <hi>Judas; but the ſon of perdition; none of them is loſt, but the ſon of perdition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How, and upon what account <hi>Judas</hi> is excepted here from the reſt of the Apoſtles, you may remember I have ſhewed you fully heretofore.

               </p>
               <p>Now he is called <hi>the ſon of perdition,</hi> not only to imply that he was a loſt creature, as conſidered in himſelf; but more then ſo, that he was deſtinated and appointed to be loſt in the eternal Counſel and Decree of God, that he deſigned him to deſtruction. A manner of Expreſſion very uſual with the Hebrews, as <hi>Calvin</hi> and ſome others after him obſerve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Text. Now this our Saviour mentions, not to lay the fault of the deſtruction of this wretched man on Gods Decree, or to take it off from <hi>Judas;</hi> But to make it to appear, that though he were a loſt creature, yet the election of the Lord remained firm, and ſtood unalterable notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: For he was not elected, but reprobated and appointed to perdition.</p>

                  <p>This was the caſe of <hi>Judas</hi> in my Text; he was <hi>Perditioni deſtinatus ac devotus,</hi> deſtinated and devoted to perdition: And therefore when he was deſtroyed and loſt, the Holy Ghoſt obſerveth of him, that <hi>he went to his own place,</hi> Act. 1.25. that is to Hell, the place which was appointed for him from Eternity: And therefore <hi>Bildad</hi> ſpeaks of ſome <hi>whom God hath caſt away,</hi> Job 8.4. And <hi>Job</hi> of ſome <hi>who are reſerved to deſtruction,</hi> Job 21.31. The Wiſe man tells us that God hath <hi>made the wicked for the day of evil,</hi> Prov. 16.4. <hi>The Lord made all things for himſelf,</hi> his own glory; yea, <hi>even the wicked</hi> for the glory of his Juſtice to be declared and manifeſted on them <hi>in the evil day,</hi> the day which is ſo to them: That is, the day of judgement and perdition of ungodly men, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calls it, 2 Epiſt. 3.7. to which day they are reſerved, as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks; you muſt conceive it in the everlaſting pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:46169:184"/>
and decree of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. As there are veſſels of mercy ordained to glory, ſo there are <hi>veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction,</hi> Rom. 9.22. Not only by their own miſdeeds, but in ſome ſence by the decree of God. Meritoriouſly indeed and in deſert they are prepared for it only by themſelves, and by their own ſins. But in deſign they are prepared for it alſo by the Counſel and the fore-appointment of the Lord. And this indeed is ſpecially intended in the place. Or elſe wherefore doth the Apoſtle for clearing of the Juſtice of the Lord in this particular, fly to his <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, his abſolute and ſoveraign power, which he hath over all his creatures, to beſtow them at his pleaſure, either to wrath, or to ſalvation: Even as the Potter is at liberty to mould his clay, to what ſhape and to what uſe he pleaſes, either to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or to diſhonour. The anſwer had been ready and at hand, if God had had no finger in the buſineſs, in preparing men to wrath, no not ſo much as by determination and decree, <hi>Paul</hi> need not have ſaid he did it by his abſolute and Soveraign power. No, if it had been ſo, he might have ſaid, God did it not all, he prepared them not at all, ordained them not at all, but they prepared themſelves to wrath and to deſtruction. But this he could not ſay; for it were quite againſt the ſaying of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iude</hi> 4. where he makes mention of ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men, <hi>who were before of old ordained to condemnation.</hi> Not only fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it by themſelves, but preordained to it by another, and that is God. Yea the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth clearly and expreſly intimate that God appointeth ſome to wrath, in that memorable place to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. where ſtirring up the Theſſalonians to exemplary holineſs of life, he quickens them with the conſideration of the high preferment which he and they and others had in that which is indeed the richeſt and the choiceſt mercy of the Lord, <hi>For God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to wrath.</hi> Others he hath; but this is our prerogative that God hath not appointed us to wrath, (as he hath done many others,) but to obtain ſalvation through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. So that the Point is plain you ſee, that God in his Eternal Counſel and Decree, hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deſigned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To open this a little to you, that ſo you may the more diſtinctly underſtand it, you muſt know, that there are two parts or acts of the decree of God, in reference to theſe whom he appointeth to deſtruction; <hi>viz.</hi> a negative, and a poſitive act.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt of theſe, the negative act, is nothing elſe but preterition, non-election, Paſſing by, and not electing ſome particular and ſpecial men to that beatitude and glory which others are appointed to. This is that will of God, by which he hath determined not to ſave them, but even to leave them in their loſt condition, that they may periſh everlaſtingly. Now this, my brethren, is expreſly and apparently implyed and included in election. For when God chooſes ſome, it follows evidently, that there are other ſome remaining, on which that act of chooſing doth not paſs. When <hi>David</hi> went to fight againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> he choſe him five ſmooth ſtones out of the brook; Who doth not preſently conceive that he refuſed other ſome? If all be taken, it is no election: ſo that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:46169:184"/>
election carries in it the firſt act of reprobation, preterition, paſſing by. When ſome are choſen, there are other ſome refuſed; when ſome are taken, there are others left.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But now there is another act of the decree of God in reference to thoſe whom he appointeth to deſtruction, which we have called a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive act. For as God leaves men, in the firſt place, in their ſins, and in their loſt condition, and doth not chooſe them to ſalvation: So in the ſecond place, he reſolveth with himſelf to condemn them and to deſtroy them for the ſin in which he leaves them, and ſo to glorifie his Juſtice in them. And this is that which ſome have ſtiled predam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, damnation in the purpoſe and decree of God. For it is one thing to decree the condemnation of ſuch as are not choſen to ſalvation: and it is another thing actually to condemn them, by executing the decree upon them. Now of this ſecond act of the decree of God it is that we ſpeak in the concluſion we are handling, That God in his Eternal Counſel and Decree hath appointed and deſigned ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſpecial perſons to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me, Why hath God done ſo? What is the reaſon of this Act of his? What doth induce him to ordain men to deſtruction?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you what is not the reaſon; And in the next place I will ſhew you what it is.</p>
                  <p>The ſins of men are not the reaſon why God ordains men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are the cauſe indeed why he deſtroyes them, but not why he ordaines them to deſtruction. Its true, ſin is conſidered in this ſecond act of reprobation, which we have ſtiled predamnation. For as the Lord condemns men for their ſins, in the great and dreadful day, ſo he accordingly decrees from everlaſting to condemn them for their ſins. He doth in time, as he decrees from all eternity; Juſt ſo and no otherwiſe. But mark it my beloved, however ſin be thought upon in the decree, yet it is not the moving cauſe of the decree, but only of the execution of it. And as it is not the fore-ſight of faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the one ſide that inclineth God to chooſe men: ſo on the other ſide it is not the foreſight of infidelity and diſobedience that inclines him to reject them and appoint them to damnation. Indeed God damns men for their ſins, yea he decrees to damn men for their ſins; but yet it is not for their ſins that he decrees it. Sin is the Cauſe, and is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the cauſe of the accompliſhment of the decree: but not of the decree it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But if ſin be not the reaſon then why God appoints men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, what is the reaſon then?</p>
                  <p>Truly there is no reaſon out of God, no moving or impulſive cauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the decree out of his own boſome. His <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is the only reaſon why he appointeth ſome to wrath, and others to ſalvation: the pleaſure of his own will. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.18. And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in that very Chapter concludeth the decree of God, both of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and of reprobation, to be abſolutely free from any motive or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:46169:185"/>
out of God himſelf, becauſe it paſſed upon the children, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> being yet unborn, having neither done good or evil, as you may ſee at large, Rom. 9.11, 12, 13. <hi>For the children being not yet born, that the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works but of him that calleth, it was ſaid, The elder ſhall ſerve the yonger, &amp;c.</hi> As it is written, <hi>Jacob have I loved,</hi> that is to chooſe him; <hi>and Eſau have I hated,</hi> to reject him. And conſequently neither election not rejection was of works, not of any thing in them, ſeeing it took hold upon them before they had a being in the world.</p>
                  <p>Yea but it will be ſaid perhaps, though they were yet unborn, and though they had done neither good nor evil, yet God fore-knew, and God foreſaw they would be born, and that in time they would do good or evil, and ſo accordingly he moulded his decree, electing him whom he foreſaw would do good, rejecting him whom he foreſaw would do evil.</p>
                  <p>But how then was it not of works, if it were of works foreſeen of the one ſide or the other? will works foreſeen ſtand better with the freeneſs of the purpoſe and decree of God, then preſent works or works in being? Not a whit. And therefore this is cleerly and apparently the force of the Apoſtles reaſon. The decree of God is free, and not of works: it is not cauſed by any thing that man doth: For it took hold of <hi>Iacob</hi> and of <hi>Eſau,</hi> being yet unborn, before they had done either good or evil, or were conſidered doing good or evil as a motive or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to prevail with God to chooſe the one or to refuſe the other.</p>
                  <p>So then you ſee the reaſon of the point. Some certain men God appointeth to perdition. Why? becauſe he will, becauſe it is his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> But you will ſay perhaps, <hi>This is very hard meaſure, that God ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain men to deſtruction, upon this account becauſe he will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>And is it not as hard meaſure, that the Creator ſhould not be allowed to have his will upon his creature? If you could make a thing of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, you would look to have the free diſpoſal of it at your own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Nay, my beloved, to uſe the inſtance the Apoſtle gives, <hi>the Potter looks to have the free diſpoſal of his clay, and of the ſelf ſame Lump to make one Veſſel to an honourable, another to a ſordid uſe.</hi> Or if he pleaſe, as ſoon as he hath finiſhed them, to daſh the one to ſhivers, and to ſave the other. If any ask a reaſon of him, it is enough for him to ſay that he doth this becauſe he will, becauſe it is his pleaſure ſo to do. He made it, and he may deſtroy it; And yet he gives but form to what he makes, he works on matter made before by God. But God creates a thing of nothing; he gives it form and matter too; and why may not he diſpoſe it as he will? Why ſhould not his authority and power be yielded and allowed to be as great upon the creature which he makes of nothing, as the Potters on the clay which he could never make?</p>
                  <p>And yet what ever Gods decree concerning any man may be, which he reſerveth in his own breaſt and boſome, he never damneth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes a man till he deſerve it. The Potter breaks a veſſell it may be for no fault at all, but to ſatisfie his fancy, or to manifeſt his power, and to ſhew what he can do. But God the great Creator of the world,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:46169:185"/>
doth never ſo with any creature; if he daſh any man to pieces, it is becauſe he hath deſerved it very juſtly by his ſins. If he condemn him, there is a meritorious cauſe. And he may truly ſay to ſuch a perſon, Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But in the ſecond place it will be ſaid perhaps by ſome,<label type="milestone">

                     <hi>If this be ſo that God in his Eternal Counſel and Decree, hath apointed and diſigned ſome certain ſpecial perſons to deſtruction, it is in vain for ſuch to hear and pray, and uſe the means of attaining to ſalvation. They were as good to fit ſtill and do nothing: for all will be to no purpoſe. If they be reprobated, they muſt be deſtroyed: the Counſell of the Lord muſt ſtand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they be reprobated? But who are reprobated, can they tell?<note place="margin">Sol.</note> Haſt thou known the mind of the Lord? Art thou aſſured that thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated and appointed to deſtruction? If ſo indeed, there were ſome colour for thee to neglect the means of attainment to ſalvation. But know, my brethren, that it is impoſſible for any man to be infallibly aſſured of his reprobation without immediate revelation, as perhaps <hi>Saul</hi> was. Its true, he may be ſure of his election: never of his reprobation. The Scripture urges and perſwades men to aſſure the one, never to aſſure the other. It giveth marks and evidences of the one; it gives no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the other. Indeed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt (where it is found) follows after of reprobation: but who is able to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be guilty of this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or no? As for my own part, I am confident that God hath ordered matters ſo, that no man ſhall be able to determine that he is rejected by him; And that to this intent, that all men may be held in diligent attendance on the means of reconciliation and attonement with him, not knowing what the iſſue and event may be. And what then? wilt thou take that to be certain which is very doubtfull, and on ſo weak a ground as this, neglect and ſlight the means, which may for ought thou knoweſt, be powerfull to the ſalvation of thy pretious ſoul for ever? Wilt thou conclude thou art rejected, and do as if this reſolution were infallible, when yet it is apparently a moſt uncertain thing, of which thou canſt not be aſſured? When the decree concerning reprobation is a ſecret and a doubtfull thing; and the command requiring thee to make thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure is a plain and certain thing: wilt thou neglect the precept and command that lies before thee, and walk by the decree that is obſcure and hidden from thee?</p>
                  <p>Shouldſt thou not rather reaſon in the caſe in hand, as Merchants and Adventurers in worldly things are wont to do? Perhaps the Lord may have a bleſſing yet in ſtore for me; Once I am ſure he hath required me to uſe the means, and therefore though there be ſome hazard in it, I will not be behind in my endeavour; at his command I will let down the net. Even ſo perhaps the Lord may have appointed me to life and glory: once I am ſure he hath commanded me to uſe the means of attaining to ſalvation: And therefore though I know not what the iſſue and event may be, I will attend upon them, be carefull in the uſe and practice of them, to the utmoſt of my power. I know, if I neglect them, I muſt periſh: if I uſe them, I may live eternally: And therefore I will rather

                  <p>A Doctrine evidently croſſing with the truth which we have plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully proved and confirmed from the Scripture, that there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and ſpecial reprobation, and therefore cannot be an univerſal ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Now that you may not be miſled in this particular, or drawn to think that God hath choſen all men to ſalvation on condition, leaving it wholly to themſelves and to their own free wils, either to ratifie it, or infringe it; ſo making his decree like a <hi>Noveriut univerſi,</hi> If men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, perſevere not, then the election muſt be void.

I ſay, that this corrupt opinion (which is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently vented now adayes) may not take with any of you, I ſhall lay down ſome arguments againſt it, and anſwer others that are brought for it.</p>
                  <p>This univerſal and conditional election overthrows the end of God, all which he aims in all his Counſels and Decrees, and in all his diſpenſations, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of his free grace. This was that which the Lord had in his eye when he appointed men to glory, even <hi>that he might make known the riches of his</hi> own <hi>glory,</hi> on thoſe which he prepared to glory, as you have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. Now how ſhall he attain this end by chooſing all men to Salvation, if they will themſelves? how is the glory of his mercy magnified and advanced? where is the freeneſs of his grace more to one man then another? ſince he doth alike for all, electeth all alike to glory and ſalvation; prepareth heaven no more for one man then another: ſo that if any man be ſaved, he may thank himſelf, he may glory in himſelf, and not in God. And therefore it is very notable that the Apoſtle making this the end of the decree of God, <hi>viz.</hi> the glory of his grace, withall diſcovers that he electeth men to life, not according to their wills, as they will either chooſe it, or refuſe it, but according to his own, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Having predeſtinated us by Jeſus Chriſt, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> How ſo? according to the pleaſure of his will. To ſhew that he works freely in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs without impulſion or provocation from external cauſes. And ſo he muſt if he will atttain his end.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> ſo it hinders our duty. It cannot chooſe but wonderfully cool and dead our hearts in rendring thankfulneſs to God, when we conſider with our ſelves that he hath done no more for us in this buſineſs of election and ſalvation then he hath for all the world. Our Saviour Chriſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to quicken his Diſciples to thanskgiving, ſhews them the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge and the preferment which they had in the mercy of the Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. and 13.16, 17. And the ſame courſe the Prophet <hi>David</hi> takes with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſal. 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſhewed his word to</hi> Jacob, <hi>his ſtatutes and his judgements to</hi> Iſrael. <hi>He dealt not ſo with other Nations,</hi> and therefore you are ſpecially engaged to praiſe the Lord. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that ſoul ſhall find it ſelf moſt quickned and enlarged to the praiſes of the Lord, that ſees his ſpecial and peculiar favour to it ſelf, which millions are rejected from. Oh, will the ſoul conſider with it ſelf in ſuch a caſe, Why hath God pitched on me neglecting others? whence was it that he took me into his decree? what did he ſee in me, more then in thoſe whom he laid by? why he did chooſe me? In our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons who are men (beloved) there is ſomething ſtill that carries and inclines us to a choice. Some fitneſs in the object of it, ſome relation to our ſelves, ſome motive or inducement that prevails upon us. But now my brethren, we are all alike to God in the act of his election; we lay together in the ſame corrupted Maſs, all weltring in the ſame blood, and tumbling in the ſame gore; and when he came to chooſe a little number in compariſon of thoſe he left, Oh what a mercy was it that he ſhould pitch on thee and me! which if he had not done, we had been loſt for ever. Truly, my brethren, did we ſit down and weigh it well in our adviſed and deliberate thoughts, it would tranſport and carry us beyond our ſelves. It would make us to break out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be God who hath choſen us:</hi> us who deſerved no more then others, who were no fitter for his choice then others. And yet us, when he hath rejected others. <hi>Oh bleſſed be the Lord for this mercy.</hi> But now, my brethren, none of this, if all be choſen to ſalvation with this condition that they will accept it, they may have it if they will; The damned reprobate in hell by this account hath as much reaſon to be thankfull as the triumphant Saint in heaven. Why, may this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Catiffe ſay, God did as much for me as him; only indeed I did not ſo much for my ſelf. And may the glorified Saint in heaven ſay, The Lord hath done as much for thoſe in hell, as ever he hath done for me. He hath elected them as well as me, and he hath aſſiſted them as much as me; for he is to all alike; only they have not uſed their own free-wills as well as I have done; and this is the only cauſe that they are damned, and I am ſaved. And therefore I wil ever thank my
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:46169:187"/>
ſelf and not God. At leaſt I have no greater cauſe to think him, then the damned have. If there be any difference between them and me, it is not God that made it, but my ſelf. God did for them and me alike. And that they are not in the ſame condition with me, the only reaſon is, becauſe we did not for ourſelves alike. And therefore they are every way as much obliged and bound to God as I am.</p>

God for his own part chooſeth all men to ſalvation, he would have all men to be ſaved. How comes it then to paſs, whence is it that they are not ſaved? Becauſe they will not themſelves. God will, and they will not; who carries it in this buſineſs? Their will takes place, and not Gods. The will of God you ſee, by this opinion, is ordered and diſpoſed by the will of man. He chooſeth all men on condition; but his final reſolution and abſolute determination is ſuſpended upon the operation of the will of man; He is at liberty to make it good, or make it void at his pleaſure: If he will be ſaved, he may; if not, he muſt be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though God for his part have ordained him to ſalvation. What is this but to make God in ſome reſpect an underling to man? to make the will of God ſubſervient to the will of man, which is a moſt blaſphemous derogation. Indeed by this opinion the Lord doth not ſo much in the buſineſs of election and ſalvation as man doth. God chooſeth man upon condition if he do thus and thus; but man is he that ſtrikes the ſtroke, and that makes it all ſure: So that he elects himſelf much more then God doth; Whereas our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>you have not choſen me; but I have choſen you,</hi> John 15.6. Not you me by your deſerts and the good uſe of your free will; but I you of my free favour.</p>

A manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion very uſual, as I might give you divers inſtances out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: It is ſaid <hi>that all</hi> Judea <hi>went to</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt and were baptized of him in Iordan,</hi> that is, ſome of all parts; <hi>That Chriſt healed all diſeaſes,</hi> that is, ſome of all kinds. So in the place forealledged, <hi>God will have all men to be ſaved,</hi> that is, ſome of all ſorts. And this was neceſſary to be urged in oppoſition to the Iews, to check their folly and preſumption, who in a kind of envious pride, reſtrained election and ſalvation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone, as if no other people ſhould be ſaved but they: And in ſavour of the Gentiles, over whom the Iews inſulted as a rejected and a

Aſſuredly, my Brethren, if God would have all men to be ſaved, all men univerſally, it is becauſe he cannot ſave them, that they are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The only cauſe why any one doth not what he deſires and wills to do, is becauſe there is a failing in his power; and were it not for want of this, there is no one in the world but would bring his will to paſs. And therefore to affirm that <hi>God deſires and wills that all men ſhould be ſaved</hi> without exception, and that the reaſon why he doth not ſave them, is the obſtinacy and perverſeneſs of their wills, by which they finally reſiſt the work of grace, and hinder God from doing his deſire and will upon them, is to make God too weak for man, who hath the better of him in the conteſtation: which is blaſphemous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is objected further, If God elect not all men to ſalvation, he is partial, ſince <label type="milestone">

                  <p>To this I anſwer, why ſhould he not be partial, if you will call it ſo,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> in the diſpoſal of a free gift, preferring one before another? Why ſhould he not do with his own what he pleaſes? this is not matter of debt, or matter of juſtice, but matter of mercy. Suppoſe he chooſe a few, what is he therefore bound to chooſe all? Indeed he is not bound to chooſe any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if he chooſe a few only, and leave the reſt who are incomparably the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>3</label> greater number, to periſh in eternal flames and torments, though he be not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, it may be thought that he is cruel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> That he is infinitely unutterably merciful that he chooſes any ſoul out of the corrupted maſs, takes ſuch a loathſome and polluted creature to himſelf. And that he leaves the reſt in that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn condition whereunto they brought themſelves, and from which he is no way bound to free them, he is manifeſtly juſt; and if he be but juſt, he is not cruel.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but he doth not only leave them in their ſins, but determines to condemn them for their ſins in the pit of Hell for ever. And is not this a piece of juſtice to condemn them for their ſins? Do not their ſins deſerve the Condemnation? So that if you look one way, he is merciful; and if you look the other, he is juſt: and if you lay them both together, mercy triumpheth over juſtice. The Lord is infinitely gracious that any are appointed to ſalvation; and he had been but righteous if all had been appointed to deſtruction. True, he rejecteth more then he electeth; but mercy is more glorious in electing one, then juſtice in rejecting all. For juſtice doth but take them as it finds them, but mercy makes them what it finds them not. There is a cauſe of juſtice in the creature; there is no cauſe at all of mercy. When God rejecteth men, he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to condemn them for their ſin &amp; diſobedience; but when he elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, he determines not to ſave them for their grace and their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

                     <hi>and to change his reſolution in many things foretold in Scripture: For inſtance, he foretold by</hi> Jonah <hi>that</hi> Nineveh <hi>ſhould be deſtroyed, at the end of forty days,</hi> Jonah 3.4. <hi>yet when they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he did not as he had foretold, ſo that he altered in appearance; yea it is ſaid expreſsly,</hi> that he repented of his Commination, <hi>ſo that he brought it not to execution;</hi> God repented of the evil which he had ſaid, that he would do unto them, and he did it not, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.10.</p>
                  <p>For clearing this,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> you may remember that univerſal rule which God lays down, for the better underſtanding of all Prophetical Praedictions in a way of Commination, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.7. The ſum is this, that they have all of them annexed to them, or implyed at leaſt, if not an expreſt condition: And ſo had this againſt the <hi>Ninivites; Yet forty days and</hi> Niniveh <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> conceive it, if they be not humbled, that was the reſerved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But they were humbled &amp; repented; though they were preſerved, God did not otherwiſe then he determined, and yet indeed he is ſaid to have <hi>repented</hi> becauſe he did ſo that he ſeemed to repent: For as a man if he have threatned that thus and thus he is reſolved to do, and after do not ſo, if he have power, is ſaid to change his mind, and to repent of what he ſaid: Even ſo the Lord when he had threatned <hi>Niniveh,</hi> and had concealed the condition, becauſe he ſpared it afterwards, and did not juſt according the letter of the Commination, is ſaid to have repented, becauſe he ſeemed to do that which in a man would have diſcovered change and alteration of his reſolution. And even as anger is aſcribed to the Lord, <hi>Non per affectum, ſed per effectum,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſay; The paſſion or affection of it is not properly attributed to God, but the effect and fruit is, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it.</hi> Even ſo repentance is not in the nature of the Lord, but the effect and iſſue of it is uſually aſcribed to him. The recalling or undoing of a thing which as far as we could judge by his words, or by his works, or our deſerts, or any other evidence that was before us, ſeemed unto us to have been his intent and purpoſe to have done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the Author of the Propheſies, as well as other parts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is unchangeable, ſo he is true; Yea, <hi>He is the God of Truth,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſtiles him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. And therefore that which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells muſt be accompliſhed and fulfilled. Obſerve it well, my Brethren, the Prophet doth not ſay, He is the true God in himſelf, and in his nature, but <hi>he is the God of Truth</hi> in his diſcoveries, and in his revelation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to men. All that comes from him is truth; <hi>He is the faithful and the true witneſs,</hi> Apoc. 3.14. Not only true and faithful as a God, but true and faithful as a witneſs. In all the teſtimonies that he gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:46169:190"/>
or of his Son, or of his works already done, or intended to be done, there is nothing elſe but truth. He cannot be the Author of a falſehood, <hi>it is impoſsible,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells you, Heb. 6.18. <hi>It is impoſsible that he ſhould lye.</hi> He can aſſoon deny himſelf, put off his Deity, ceaſe to be God, as father an untruth; and therefore that which he foretels muſt be accompliſhed in his ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as the Author of the Propheſies is unchangeable and true, ſo the Word of God it ſelf, of which the Propheſies are part, is ſo alſo. The Word of God is unchangeable and true, even as God himſelf is, and therefore all the Propheſies and the Praedictions of it muſt be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Word of God is an unchangeable, an unalterable Word; when he hath ſaid a thing, and ſaid it abſolutely, that muſt ſtand, there is no revocation of it in the ſenſe that he hath ſaid it. <hi>Thy Word, O Lord,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David, is ſetled in heaven,</hi> Pſal. 119.89. It is an Eſtabliſhed thing, never to be removed again. And therefore it is ſaid to be <hi>ſetled in heaven;</hi> There are great changes here below continually, but there is none above in heaven: and there the Word of God is ſetled above the reach of any alteration. <hi>All fleſh is graſs,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>all the glory of man, as the flower of graſs; the graſs withereth, and the flower thereof fadeth away, but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as it is unchangeable, ſo it is true; yea, it is the Word of Truth. It is an Epithite that is impoſed upon it often: <hi>Thy Word is true from the beginning,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.160. And ſo it ſhall be to the end. And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord endure for ever,</hi> not in their being only, but their truth. You know the Scripture is often called <hi>a teſtimony,</hi> or <hi>a witneſs:</hi> Either it is a teſtimony that the Father gives us of the Son, or that the Son gives us of the Father; either it is a witneſs to us of things that have been done, or elſe (which is a little ſtronger) it is a witneſs to us of things that ſhall be done. Now this is a condition abſolutely neceſſary to a teſtimony or a witneſs, that it declare the truth and nothing elſe. Or elſe how ſhall it be depended and relyed upon? and ſo how ſhall the Scripture be <hi>the Word of Faith,</hi> as it is called, unleſs it be <hi>the Word of Truth?</hi> How ſhall this teſtimony challenge faith from us, unleſs it utter truth to us? How ſhall it be believed, if it be not wholly true? and therefore truth is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſcribed to it as a witneſs: <hi>The teſtimonies of the Lord are ſure,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. That which they tell, hath been; and that which they foretell, ſhall ſurely be accompliſhed and fulfilled.</p>

How ſhould their hearts diſſolve within them, when they hear his threatning words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't againſt them? How ſhould the Adulterer tremble when he hears that flaming Commination, <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will judge!</hi> how ſhould the drunkard tremble when he hears thoſe dreadful woes that

are denounced to drunkards, up and down the Prophets everywhere? How ſhould the wretched worldling tremble, when he hears that dreadfull threatning, <hi>that no covetous perſon hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God?</hi> How ſhould the lier, and the dogg that barks and ſnarls and ſnaps at holineſs, and the unclean wretch tremble when they hear that ſuch ſhall have their <hi>everlaſting portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone!</hi> And ſo for other ſinners againſt whom there are heavy things foretold in Scripture, how ſhould they ſhake and quiver, when they read and hear them!</p>
                  <p>But alas there are abundance who ſteel and fortifie their hearts againſt them, who give no credit to the threatnings of the word, as if they were but <hi>bruta fulmina,</hi> but empty cracks: who when they hear them thundred out againſt them, ſay with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 5.12. <hi>It is not he, neither ſhall evil come upon us, nor ſhall we ſee ſword or famine.</hi> Oh my beloved, do not belye the Lord in this faſhion; do not delude your own ſouls. Believe it, <hi>Judgement is towards you,</hi> as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5.1. although it be not actually upon you. The wrath of God commeth, it is a comming ſtill, and in the end, depend upon it, it will come home. What do you think that if you do ſuch things, you ſhall eſcape the vengeance of God? No, be aſſured that if you perſevere without repentance, you ſhall feel it with a witneſs. There is not any thing denounced againſt you in the Scripture, but ſhall be fulfilled upon you to the utmoſt.</p>

You that are members of the Church, look over all the Book of God, collect together all the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, from the beginning of it to the end; conſider all the choice and pretious mercies that are contained in thoſe promiſes, and ſatisfie your ſouls with a certain expectation of them all. There is not one of all thoſe promiſes ſhall fall unaccompliſhed to the ground, or fail of execution in the Lords time. And therefore look on all the good things promiſed there as ſure mercies, (ſo they are called the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi>) which ſhall not fail you when the ſeaſon comes. And when you meet with any thing that ſpecially concerns you in ſuch a caſe or ſuch a condition, that might be a ſupport and comfort to you in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the like, Oh give not way to one unbelieving thought, do not forſake your own mercies.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the threatnings, That which the Lord denounced to <hi>Noah,</hi> that he might publiſh it to all the world, that he would utterly deſtroy all fleſh from off the earth, and by a flood of water too, was as impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable as any thing almoſt could be, as like to be derided by the wiſe men of the world; Yet <hi>Noah</hi> being warned of God, believed it, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly prepared the Ark, as you may ſee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So for the promiſes of Scripture, how improbable ſoever, the Saints of old have cloſed with them. What an unlikely promiſe was it that was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould have a Son when he was full a hundred years of age, and a ſeed that ſhould be as innumerable as the ſtars of heaven? and that by <hi>Sarah</hi> too, a withered and a barren wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? What ſtrong objections might they both have brought againſt it? And yet they did not argue, but believed that it ſhould be juſt as the Lord had ſpoken: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. 4.20, 21. <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God, through unbelief, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God.</hi> Yea, and of <hi>Sarah</hi> too, though ſhe were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what doubtfull and incredulous in the beginning, yet even of her he ſaith, <hi>She iudged him faithfull that had promiſed.</hi> That great and Maſter promiſe of the reſurrection of the body from the duſt, is far above the principles of nature and philoſophy, and therefore the Philoſophers at
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:46169:191"/>
                     <hi>Athens</hi> laughed at it. Yet <hi>Job</hi> believed this ſeeming Paradox, as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>Job</hi> 19.26. <hi>I know</hi> ſaith he, he uſes ſuch a word you ſee as inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates a full perſwaſion. I am confident of this, <hi>that though after mys kin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh I ſhall ſee God.</hi> And ſo let us, my brethren, whatſoever is foretold in Scripture, let us ſtedfaſtly believe that it ſhall ſurely be accompliſhed and fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the firſt argument or reaſon, with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth his petition to his Father, in behalf of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Diſciples, that he himſelf would undertake the keeping of them; <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own name.</hi> Which hath been taken, as you may remember, from his own effectual preſervation of them during the time that he had been amongſt them. And therefore he would have his Father keep them now, becauſe he himſelf had kept them, and kept them very ſafe till now. <hi>While I was with them in the world I kept them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before our Saviour adds a ſecond reaſon to enforce this ſupplication and requeſt of his, he interpoſes a diſcovery of the end, why he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, and why he is ſo earneſt in it: Saith he, I put up this Petition to thee while I am reſident in this world; I do it in the hearing of my Apoſtles and Diſciples, that they might have their comfort much encreaſed by this means. <hi>And now I come to thee, and theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the words you ſee are the account our Saviour gives his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Petition which he makes for his Apoſtles and Diſciples, or rather of the circumſtances of the making of it. Why he makes it in the world, why he did not defer the making of it till he came to heaven; and ſate down at the right hand of his Father, there to be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Interceſſor for his people, but rather choſe to make it here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went, in the preſence and the ears of his Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, while they were by, and hearkning to him. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi> And here we have two things to be examined and reſolved.</p>
                  <p>What our Saviour means by his joy, which he would have fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in his Apoſtles and Diſciples, why he calls it His joy, and not theirs. <hi>That they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves,</hi> not their own joy ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, but <hi>my joy fulfilled in them.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>How this joy ſhould be fulfilled by his preſenting this Petition for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them to his Father, in their hearing, before he left this world, which way this circumſtance ſhould tend ſo much, and be ſo available to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of that joy.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, our Saviour calls the joy which he would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> have to be fulfilled in his Diſciples, <hi>his ioy.</hi> Not that he was the ſubject of it, or that it was inherent in himſelf. But either, Firſt, becauſe he was the object of it, <hi>that they might have my ioy,</hi> that is to ſay, the joy which they take in me, <hi>fulfilled in themſelves.</hi> Or Secondly, as <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks, becauſe he was the author of it. <hi>That they might have my ioy,</hi> the joy which they have from me, <hi>fulfilled in themſelves.</hi>

Either as it manifeſted Chriſts affection to them, and his care of them, in which they could not but exceedingly rejoyce.

But this he did before he went, in their hearing, he earneſtly beſought his Father to take ſpecial care of them, to keep them through his own name; they heard it with their own ears, how earneſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate he was, which could not chooſe but be an extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to them, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould have ſuch dear and ſingular regard to them.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe it might fulfill their joy, as it aſſured them of their ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, after Chriſt was gone from them.</p>
                  <p>There is no queſtion to be made, they were in many doubts and fears when he was about to leave them. And had he gone without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any care of their ſafety, their ſorrows would have been increaſed. If he had only prayed in ſecret for them to his Father, and deſired him to keep them, this would have added to their ſafety; but what would this have added to their joy? But when they heard him being ready to depart, to yield them up in ſuch a ſerious ſolemn manner to his Father, and to make this his laſt requeſt to him while he was here in this world, that he would keep them, this could not but aſſure them that they ſhould be kept, and ſo fill them full of joy. And hence our Saviour having put up that Petition for them, <hi>Holy Father, keep them through thy own name;</hi> And that becauſe <hi>while I was with them in the world, I kept them;</hi> Adds this immediately, <hi>and now come, I to thee: and theſe things ſpeak I in the world,</hi> before I come; I ſpeak them here among them, that my Diſcples being ear-witneſſes to my importunate and earneſt interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them, may have the joy, either which they take in me, or which they receive from me, the more abundantly fulfilled in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The words thus opened, yield us out three Obſervations.</p>

                  <p>If they have any true and real joy, it comes from him, they have it from the Lord Chriſt: And therefore it is called his joy, becauſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it is his, and comes from him to them by way of diſpenſation and communication, <hi>that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi> So in
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46169:192"/>
another place he tells his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that if they were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to him, they ſhould abide in his love; And adds immediately, <hi>theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that my joy might remain in you,</hi> (that is to ſay) the joy that I give you, <hi>John</hi> 15.11. Indeed it is the fruit and the effect of Chriſts kingdom, erected in the hearts of his people, as the Apoſtle ſhews us, Rom. 14.17. <hi>His Kingdom is not meat and drink, but righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt. You ſhall be ſorrowfull,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy, John</hi> 16.20. And who can turn it into joy but Chriſt only?</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me how and in what reſpect is Chriſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the joy of his people? Beloved, I might inſtance in a multitude of things, but I ſhall draw them all to three heads. Chriſt is the Author of the joy of his people,</p>
                  <p>As he is their Prophet to inſtruct them. The ſtate of ignorance my <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> brethren, is a ſtate of darkneſs, ſo it is often ſtiled in Scripture. And that is an uncomfortable ſtate, full of fear, and full of ſorrow. But when Chriſt comes with light, and information, and inſtruction, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Prophet to them, he gives them extraordinary comfort. In that he gives them light, he gives them joy; for both of them are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Pſal. 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and joy for them that are upright in heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As he is their King to rule them: you heard but now that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſtands in joy. And hence his ſubjects are exhorted to rejoyce in him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.2. <hi>Let the Children of</hi> Zion <hi>be joyful in their King.</hi> Now as a King, my brethren, he is many wayes the author of the joy of his people, I will name a few of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As he ſubdues their enemies, and gives them peace. And this he doth, my brethren, for he is the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and the Prince of peace. And when he doth it, he is an extraordinary comfort to his people. When he ſubdues their enemies within them, and ſo gives them inward peace. When he maſters and brings under their ſtubborn and rebellious Luſts and ſtrong corruptions which are ſuch a daily trouble and vexation to them. O what a joy is it to his people, when (according to his Covenant) he ſaves them from thoſe enemies! then they ſerve him without fear, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. and if without fear, then certainly with great joy: So when he ſaves them from their enemies without them, and ſo gives them outward peace, then he gives them joy too. Such times have ſtill been celebrated and obſerved with extraordinary gladneſs and rejoycing. Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when <hi>Babylon</hi> goes down, the arch-enemy of his Church and his people, then Chriſt hears many Halelujahs, for the Lord God om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent reigneth. Then they that ſtand upon the glaſſie ſea, are in a very chearie frame, They ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the ſong of the Lamb, <hi>Juſt and true are thy wayes, O thou King of Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As a King Chriſt is the Author of the joy of his people as he gives them his ſpirit. For this he doth under the notion of a King, and when he doth it, then he fils them full of joy. The Spirit is the Comforter, that is his name, ſo he is ſtiled very often, to ſhew us what his Office,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:46169:193"/>
work, and buſineſs is: And therefore joy is made a companion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to ſhew us that they uſe to go together, Act. 13.52. <hi>The Diſciples,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and the Apoſtle tells us, that joy is one eſpecial fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is live, joy:</hi> And hence the Holy Ghoſt is called <hi>the Oyl of gladneſs,</hi> Iſa. 45.7. As it is <hi>the Oyl of gladneſs, it makes glad the heart of man, and it makes his face to ſhine:</hi> And conſequently when our King pours out this Oyl upon his people, he pours out joy and gladneſs with it. Then his joy is fulfilled in them, becauſe they have this oyl from him; <hi>He is anointed with it above his fellows;</hi> it flows down from him the head, even to the loweſt members of his body.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As a King Chriſt is the Author of the joy of his people, as he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes recompences and rewards to them: For this he muſt do as a King too, and when he doth it, he makes them overflow with joy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will have them to be out of meaſure glad, even in the expectation of it, Luk. 6.23. <hi>Rejoyce and leap for joy,</hi> ſaith he: and why ſo? <hi>for great is your reward in heaven:</hi> And if they have ſuch cauſe to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the expectation, how much more in the fruition? When Chriſt ſhall ſay to every one of his, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> into the ſelf-ſame joy which I thy Lord and Maſter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred firſt into, and took poſſeſſion of before thee: Then indeed the joy of Chriſt ſhall be communicated to them. Then they ſhall have his joy fulfilled in them to the very utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt is the Author of the joy of his people, as he is their Prieſt to ſacrifice and intercede for them. Both ways he is the Fountain of their comfort. I ſhall a little touch them in their order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As he is their Prieſt to ſacrifice, he is the Author of their joy, for by this means he ſatisfies the juſtice of his Father for them, he frees them from the guilt of all their ſins, he reconcileth them to God: And is he not in this reſpect the cauſe of extraordinary comfort to his people? Is it not a ſad thing for a perſon to live at enmity with God who made him, and will judge him in the great day? If peace with God be ſo infinitely ſweet, is not enmity with God full of fear, and full of horror? is it not a doleful thing for any perſon to be dead in Law, bound over to the everlaſting wrath and vengeance of the great God; in danger every hour to be haled and dragged away to execution, and to be caſt into the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone? and is it not a joyful thing to be delivered out of ſuch a ſtate as this is? Now this our Saviour as a Prieſt hath done for his people, in a way of ſatisfaction, and ſo hath given them cauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great joy, as the Angel intimates when he informs the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds where he was born, and what he was to do, Luk. 2.10. <hi>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Chriſt is his peoples Prieſt to intercede for them, he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their joy: It is an extraordinary comfort to them, that Chriſt appears in heaven for them in all cauſes, to offer up and to ſecond their Petitions, to plead the cauſes of their ſouls before his Father; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my Text, he gives them as it were a taſt of his future Interceſſion, that thereby they might gueſs what he would do when he was come to
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:46169:193"/>
heaven; and that to this end he might repleniſh them with joy and comfort: <hi>Theſe things ſpeak I in the world, while I am yet among them, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves,</hi> That hearing what I do now, while I am here, they might a little gueſs what I am like to do hereafter, when I am once ſate down at the right hand of my Father, and ſo might be full of comfort, yea though I am departing from them, while they conſider with themſelves, If he do ſo much now, ſurely when he comes to heaven, he will do much more.</p>
                  <p>Is Chriſt the Author and the Fountain of the joy of his people? Then <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> certainly they that are out of Chriſt can have no true and ſolid joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are divided from the Fountain of it: They cannot have his joy in them, becauſe they have no union with him: and therefore they are frequently forbidden to rejoyce in Scripture, let their caſe otherwiſe be what it will, or what it can: <hi>Go to ye rich men, weep and howl,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 5.1. Why, might they ſay, why ſhould we weep, for we have all things at our hearts deſire? yet <hi>weep</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, although not for the preſent miſery, yet <hi>for the miſery that ſhall come upon you. There is no peace,</hi> and conſequently no joy to wicked men: And therefore this me thinks ſhould caſt a damp upon the mirth and jollity of ſuch people. There are very many of them, who though they be as lewd, and vitious, and prophane as it is poſſible for men to be, yet they are out of meaſure chearful, they give themſelves to nothing elſe but mirth and joy. Now I beſeech you ſeriouſly conſider with your ſelves, whence comes this joy? you have it not from Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Fountain only of the joy of his people, and conſequently it is feigned and unſound. And therefore ſay to this falſe joy of yours, as the Wiſeman counſels you, <hi>What is it that thou doſt?</hi> Is there any true cauſe why we ſhould be thus over-merry? have we any reaſon for it? Examine it, and you ſhall find that it is mad laughter, as it is ſtiled in the Scripture: For as a mad man laughs he knows not why, even ſo do wicked and ungodly men; they have no reaſon to rejoyce, but rather to lament and howl, and melt away in ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Is Chriſt the Author, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then I beſeech you my Brethren; do you <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> fetch your joy and comfort thence: Drink you out of the Fountain, and not out of broken ciſterns. It is the fault of many, who do indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Jeſus Chriſt, they draw not all their comfort from him, but too much from other things, perhaps from creatures: Nay, which is worſe, ſometimes from ſinful and unlawful pleaſures: and ſo they have much joy within them, which they never had from Chriſt, of which he is not the Author. However they be full of joy ſometimes, his joy is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them, but their own. Oh, my Beloved, think upon it when you rejoyce ſo much in worldly comforts, in houſes, and eſtates, and means, and friends, and outward ſuccors, is this the joy of Chriſt in you? did it come from Chriſt to you? be you ſure you had it there? Nay, my Beloved, when you rejoyce ſometimes in ſinful ſatisfactions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, is Chriſt the Author and the Fountain of this joy in you? Alas, this is an earthly, ſenſual, ſinful joy. The joy of Chriſt which he beſtows upon his people is an heavenly, ſpiritual, holy joy; ſuch as no worldly
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:46169:194"/>
thing can raiſe in you, ſuch as the world can neither give nor take from you: And therefore I beſeech you who are Chriſts, go not to the world, and much leſs to the Devil for your joy: Fetch not your comfort from any of theſe things below; but go to Jeſus Chriſt, and fetch it there, he hath enough in him, and that which he hath is right. Rejoyce not in the creature, but in Chriſt, <hi>and then rejoyce with exceeding great joy, with joy unſpeakable and glorious;</hi> that when your hearts are dilated to the utmoſt, when they are full up to the brim, and even over-flow with joy, it may be truly ſaid of you, that not the joy of this world, and much leſs the joy of ſin, but the joy of Jeſus Chriſt, his joy is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in you.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE. 2.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to be full of holy joy.</head>
                  <p>THis he declares to be his purpoſe and intention in my Text, the thing at which he aims in making this Petition in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, while he was in the world among them, and while he was in their hearing: <hi>Theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi> By which it is apparent, that Jeſus Chriſt hath a ſingular regard to the comfort of his people, that he would have their hearts repleniſhed with the conſolations which they have from him. He is not ſatisfied that they have ſome degrees of joy begun; No, he deſires to have this joy compleated and fulfilled in them to the very utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the Chapter next before, he gives them counſel and direction how they might attain to this, how they might come to have their hearts brim full of holy joy; by which he makes it to appear, that he for his part was willing that it ſhould be ſo, Joh. 16.24. <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that your joy may be ful.</hi> The Apoſtle hath a phraſe that looks much this way, 2 Cor. 1.5. <hi>As the ſufferings of Chriſt abound much in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt; q. d.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation which we have by Chriſt, which he diſpenſeth, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth to us, is an abundant conſolation. He doth not give us ſlight and ſlender comforts, his conſolations are not ſmall; No, it is uſual with him when his hand is in, to exceed and to abound, to do over and above for his people; <hi>Be you glad and rejoyce for ever, in that which I create,</hi> ſaith he, Iſa. 65.18. <hi>For behold, I create</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>a rejoycing, and her people a joy;</hi> Though there be no appearance of it for the preſent, no probability from whence it ſhould ariſe, yet I will do it out of nothing: I will not only make them joyful, but a rejoycing and a joy; I will make them all joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="343" facs="tcp:46169:194"/>But not to reſt in generals, I ſhall proceed to ſhew you more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and diſtinctly, that Jeſus Chriſt hath made it ſufficiently to appear, that he would have his people to be full of joy: and this he hath done many ways.</p>
                  <p>By publiſhing the Goſpel to them, which as it is a Goſpel of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſo of Conſolation; and therefore it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, good news; or as the Angel tells the Shepherds, Luk. 2.10. <hi>good tidings of great joy.</hi> In which reſpect it is very notable, that when our Saviour was about to preach the Goſpel, he was anointed with the Spirit, which is called <hi>the Oyl of gladneſs. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>becauſe he hath anointed me,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. And what follows? why then <hi>he preaches good tidings to the meek, he binds up the broken-hearted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth liberty to Captives, and opening of the priſon doors to thoſe that are bound there,</hi> which is very joyful tidings: <hi>He comforts thoſe that are in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, appoints to thoſe that mourn in Sion</hi> (not to thoſe that mourn abroad, but to thoſe that mourn in Sion, in the Church,) <hi>beauty for aſhes, the Oyl of joy for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs:</hi> So that you ſee, my Brethren, it is all joy, and all comfort. By which it is apparent, that our Saviours ſpecial aim and drift in publiſhing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is, that the people might be full of joy. And therefore it is much to be obſerved, that when our Saviour entred on his Miniſtry, aſſoon as he had been baptized and tempted, he preached his very firſt Sermon, upon this comfortable Goſpel Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.17. to ſhew what was to be the main intent and drift of his miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt gives his people pretious promiſes, and ſeals them with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his own blood, <hi>that they might be full of joy.</hi> Indeed this is the great end, my Beloved, both of the promiſe, and of the confirmation of it. It's true, if Chriſt had been reſerved, if he had kept his purpoſe and intention in his breaſt, and in his boſom; if he had made his people no promiſe, the execution of his merciful deſigns had not been leſs ſure and certain in it ſelf, but it had been leſs ſure to us; we had not had the leſs benefit, but we had had the leſs comfort; For he would ſurely have fulfilled his own intentions to his people, though he had never been obliged by promiſe to perform them.</p>
                  <p>So, when the promiſes were made, there is no doubt they would have been obſerved and kept, though they had never been confirmed: yet Chriſt hath ratified them with his own blood, as the Apoſtle ſhews us, Heb. 9.16. <hi>Not with the blood of Bulls and Goats, but with his own moſt pretious blood.</hi> And why hath he done this? why doubtleſs, that there might be nothing wanting to his peoples comfort. The promiſe is not made a whit more certain by our Saviours ſealing of it with his blood, but we are made the more certain: The promiſe is not made a whit the more ſure, but we are the more aſſured, and ſo we have the more comfort. What do we think of God, that he who is the God of Truth, would not have kept his promiſes, that he would have broken with us, had they not been thus confirmed? No, certainly my Brethren, he would have been firm and conſtant, but we might have been aſſaulted with continual doubts and fears, we ſhould not have attained to ſuch unſhaken and ſuch ſweet
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:46169:195"/>
aſſurance. And therefore Chriſt hath ſet his ſeal to all the promiſes, he hath ſealed them with his blood, to this end, <hi>that we might have ſtrong conſolation,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18. He hath ſhed his blood you ſee, that our comfort might not be weak, but ſtrong comfort; that our joy might not be imcompleat, but full joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt gives his people glorious Ordinances, that they might be full of joy. For Ordinances are not for our profit only, but they are for our comfort too. Oh how was <hi>David</hi> taken with them? How did they fill his heart with joy? when he was baniſhed from them for a time, how did he melt to think upon the overflowing Conſolations he had ſometimes found in them? How did his heart pant and gaſp after them? Oh with what ſelf-conſuming wiſhes did he long to be reſtored to them? <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.4. No queſtion he deſired many things, but one thing he deſired above the reſt, <hi>that he might dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of his life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple</hi> where publick Ordinances were diſpenſed: Which ſhews the infinite delight he took in them. I might diſtinctly ſhew how ſpecial Ordinances ſerve for the comfort of the Lords people; <hi>I will bring them to my Mountain, ſaith the Lord, and make them joyfull in my houſe of prayer,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. So for the word, Jer. 15.16. <hi>Thy word was to me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet there, <hi>the joy and the rejoycing of my heart. With joy ſhall ye draw water,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>out of the wells of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Iſa. 12.3. Some underſtand the Ordinances by the wells in that place. You ſee particularly then what the end of Chriſt is, in give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ordinances to his people, and what uſe they ſerve for. Not only to help onward their Salvation, but their Conſolation too. By which it is apparent, that even in theſe diſpenſations he hath a great aſpect upon their comfort.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſt gives his people cleer diſcoveries and revelations of himſelf, <hi>that they might be full of joy:</hi> you may obſerve how they were overjoyed to whom he ſhewed himſelf after his reſurrection from the dead, they were not able to contain themſelves. And ſo when Chriſt reveals himſelf to any ſoul at this day, when he comes in and ſhews himſelf to it, it is ſometimes almoſt tranſported to an extaſie of joy. Eſpecially when he hath hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf awhile, then ſuch diſcoveries of himſelf are out of meaſure ſweet and pretious. When this Sun of righteouſneſs hath been overcaſt awhile, ſo that the Saints have walked in darkneſs dayes and years, without a glimps of this reviving light, Oh with what inward raviſhment doth it break forth upon the ſoul again! The wife while ſhe enjoyes the conſtant preſence of her loving husband, it may be thinks not much upon it, ſhe is not much affected with it. But if he have been long away, ſo that ſhe hath not heard for many years neither where her husband is, nor when he means to come again, and after all her fruitleſs expectations of him, hath reſolved with her ſelf, that out of queſtion ſhe ſhall never ſee him more, and then at laſt, when ſhe is wholly our of hopes, in ſtrikes her husband on a ſuddain at the door, ſhe is not able to contain her ſelf for joy, his preſence is incomparably ſweet and pleaſing to her. Even ſo when poor diſtreſſed ſouls have waited long for Chriſt, and thought

that they ſhould never ſee him more with comfort, and then at length he comes and ſhewes himſelf to them; his gratious preſence is extremely pretious; He makes them full of joy with his countenance, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.28.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſends the Comforter to his people, that they might be full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> joy: when he promiſed him you know to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, they were full of ſorrow; and he did this as an antidote againſt it. <hi>Come, be not troubled,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I will ſend you another Comforter that ſhall abide with you for ever,</hi> John 14.16. <hi>I</hi> have been a Comforter to you, I confeſs; but ſeeing I am ready to depart from you, I will not leave you comfortleſs; no, <hi>I will ſend you another Comforter,</hi> one that ſhall comfort you as much as I have done, and one that ſhall ſtick to you too, and ſhall not leave you, as I am about to do, but <hi>ſhall abide with you for ever.</hi> So that you ſee one ſpecial end of Chriſt in ſending down the Holy Ghoſt into the hearts of his people; is to comfort them and cheer them; to be to them not only a ſpirit of Sanctification, but a ſpirit of Conſolation, and ſo diſcovers that he hath a great regard to the joy of his people.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt gives deliverance to his people, <hi>that they may be full of joy.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> He hath divers other ends why he becomes a Saviour to them in the day of their diſtreſs; but this is not the leaſt of all, that he may put new joy into their hearts, and a new Song into their mouths. When he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to the ſalvation of his people, in doing ſo he appeareth to their joy, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.5. That is the End and Drift of his Appearance.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt hath purchaſed Heaven for his people, <hi>that they might be full of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> ioy;</hi> For Heaven, as it is a place of the heigth of holineſs, ſo it is a place of the heigth of happineſs. Here indeed we are in <hi>Bochim,</hi> in a place of weeping; we go through a vale of tears, and digg up Wells, but they are of ſalt water, the rain alſo fills the pools. But when we are arrived at Heaven, we ſhall weep no more, but all our tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes. We ſhall not have a wrinkle in our faces, nor a tear upon our cheeks, nor a ſad thought upon our hearts, but all ſhall be ſmooth and clear and ſweet, and that for ever. Then we ſhall be full of joy; Chriſts joy ſhall be fulfilled in us, yea <hi>we ſhall have the fulneſs of joy,</hi> Pſalm 16. ult. Indeed full joy importeth nothing but enough to fill us, ſo much as we are capable of, as is commenſurate to our capacity, as we are able to receive. But on the other ſide the fulneſs of joy importeth all the meaſures and degrees of it; So that there can be nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it; there is nothing wanting to it to make it abſolute in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; It is not to be raiſed higher any way; And this hath Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and purchaſed for us. By theſe things it is evident that Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to be full of holy joy.</p>
                  <p>But wherefore will he have it to be ſo? Why would he have his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be full of holy joy?</p>
                  <p>Out of ſelf-reſpect he would have it to be ſo, becauſe by reaſon of the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> neerneſs of his union with his people, he hath a kind of ſhare in their comfort. As his joy is their joy, according to his own expreſſion in
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:46169:196"/>
my text, <hi>that they may have my ioy fulfilled in themſelves:</hi> So upon the other ſide, their joy is his joy. And as there is a ſocial glory of the head and of the members; as the School-expreſſion is; <hi>as Chriſt is glorified in the glory of his people,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.12. ſo there is a ſocial joy of the head and of the members; Chriſt rejoyceth in the joy of his people. The Comfort of the members redoundeth alſo to the Comfort of the head. As Chriſt delights in the proſperity, ſo in the joy of his people. When they are joyfull, <hi>he rejoyceth over them with joy, and joyeth over them with ſinging,</hi> as his own expreſſion is, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Chriſt would have his people to be full of holy joy, to recompence them for their ſorrow. They are deſcribed to be ſuch as mourn, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. That uſes to be firſt with them, they uſe to begin there; But then they do not uſe to end there. And therefore it is added preſently, <hi>for they ſhall be comforted. Bleſſed are they that mourn for they ſhall be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> And Chriſt would have their comfort to be anſwerable to their ſorrow: <hi>That as his ſufferings have abounded in them, their conſolation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo may abound by him,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. Indeed <hi>they go forth weeping, bearing pretious ſeed,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.6. They ſow in ſhowry weather, in a weeping time. In ſuch a time did <hi>David</hi> ſow the ſeed of true repentance for his ſin; he wept ſo much that he made his bed to ſwimm, <hi>and watered his Couch with his tears:</hi> In ſuch a time did <hi>Peter</hi> ſow the ſame ſee; in a time of bitter weeping, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>ult.</hi> But then the harveſt makes them ample recompence, for all the dark and ſad and ſhowry weather in the ſowing time. They come again with joy, and they bring their ſheaves with them. They ſcatter it by grains, but they gather it by ſheaves; they have twenty, thirty, forty, yea an hundred fold for one.</p>
                  <p>So that if any now ſhould ask me, You ſay that Chriſt would have his people to rejoyce; but what? would he not have them mourn too? Yes he would have them mourn, but in order to rejoycing. Sorrow is an unperfect paſſion, and is not for it ſelf, but for ſome higher uſe, as all the reſt of the declining paſſions or affections are. As hatred is for love, and fear for confidence, ſo ſorrow alſo is for joy, unto which it is ſubſervient. As lancing is not for it ſelf, but for eaſe and remedy: and as a potion is not properly for ſickneſs (though it cauſe it for a ſeaſon) but for health: ſo ſorrow is for joy, and joy is the end of ſorrow in the Saints. And Chriſt intends it to be ſo; <hi>You ſhall be ſorrowfull</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples) <hi>but your ſorrow ſhall be turned into Joy,</hi> John 16.20. <hi>He gives to them that mourn in</hi> Zion, <hi>beauty for aſhes, the oil of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for mourning, and the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. <hi>The ranſom'd of the Lord</hi> go out lamenting, but they <hi>return to</hi> Zion <hi>with Songs and everlaſting Joy upon their heads,</hi> Iſa. 35. ult.</p>

Sorrow is a kind of ſtraightning the heart; a ſad heart is a ſtraigthned heart, it is ſhut up, it cannot pray, it cannot praiſe, it can do nothing with enlargement. And therefore the Apoſtle calleth mourning <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:46169:196"/>
whether it do not make them indiſpoſed to duty, unfit to hear, unfit to pray, and in a word unfit for any part of Chriſts ſervice. But holy joy upon the other ſide dilates the heart, it ſpreads it, and it widens it, and conſequently doth not only make it fit for duty, but it makes it large in duty. It makes it to abound, and to exceed in every ſervice that is ſuitable to joy; It carries it beyond the ordinary rate. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to be full of joy, that they may be full of fruit, and that they may abound in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt would have his people full of holy Joy?<label type="milestone">

Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to rejoice, yea to be full of Joy as their very hearts can hold; but they will not ſuffer it, but alwayes ſeek as much as lies in them to interrupt their comfort, and to diſturb their peace and joy. They diſturb them by their perſecutions with the hand and with the tongue, and which is worſe, they diſturb them by their ſins; They rail at holineſs and holy men, blaſpheme religion, and the name of Chriſt, of purpoſe to diſquiet and to vex his people, who cannot chooſe but mourn and weep for theſe things.

Now I beſeech you my beloved, conſider what the will of Chriſt is, and let him have his will in this buſineſs; uſe all means poſſible to have your hearts brim-full of holy Joy; And to this end I ſhall preſcibe you ſome directions.</p>
                  <p>Be converſant and ſtudious in the word of Chriſt. There is the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fountain of living waters, whence every may draw ſufficient to refreſh his fainting ſoul in all his troubles and afflictions. <hi>The ſtatutes of the Lord are right,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>rejoycing the heart,</hi> Pſal. 19.8. <hi>Through comfort of the Scriptures we have hope,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 15.4. (Philoſophers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have taught us many wayes to fence and fortifie our hearts againſt ſorrow.) But when the Lord ſhall ſet afflictions home upon the ſoul, and put a ſting into them too, there is nothing in the world that can cement and cheer us, but the comfort that is fetched out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. We may run in our diſtreſs to other means as <hi>Saul</hi> when he was
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:46169:197"/>
with a melancholy humor to the minſtrel; but we ſhall find that nothing goes the right way, and that we graſp at nothing but ſome empty ſuccors of contentment, unleſs we comfort our ſelves with theſe words, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ult. David</hi> was cut ſhort of nothing that the world could have afforded to revive his drooping ſpirit; yet he profeſſeth freely, that he muſt have fainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had been ſtaid with better comfort: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Word had been my comfort, I ſhould have periſhed in my affliction,</hi> Pſal. 119.92.

And therefore at this Fountain let us draw if we mean to have comfort; but chiefly let us wait upon the publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word of God, which is called the Miniſtry of reconciliation, in which there are divulged glad tidings of good things, which ſhould carry ſomething in the power and efficacy of it to work joy: For God doth commonly diſpenſe it rather by the way of hearing them by the way of reading the Scriptures: And hence ſaith <hi>David, Make me to hear of joy and gladneſs, that ſo the bones that thou haſt broken may rejoyce,</hi> Pſal. 51.8. It is the Publique Ordinance, it is the Publique Ordinance that is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter one of a thouſand that comforts the dejected ſoul, as you may ſee, <hi>Job</hi> 33.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Imploy your ſerious thoughts upon the meditation and ſurvey of that delitious place, where <hi>there is fulneſs of all joy and pleaſures for evermore,</hi> into which you that are Chriſts, aſſoon as you are paſt through the veil of tears, ſhall enter, and there continue and abide for ever: There is the place where you ſhall ſigh and weep, and mourn no more, where all your tears will be wiped away from your eyes; and ſurely did you think upon this joy with which you ſhall be filled there to over-flowing, this would preſerve you here from being ſwallowed up with over-much ſorrow; we <hi>rejoyce,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. How? not in the fruition; No, <hi>in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 15.4. Indeed the Saints of God while they compaſs and carry their afflictions according to their preſent ſtate, are very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and diſconſolate, and ſo at once they do an injury to Chriſt, who hath reſerved ſuch pretious comforts for them in the world to come: And to themſelves who have received good aſſurance that they ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enjoy them in their ſeaſon; but did they walk by faith, and not by ſight; did they not look ſo much upon the difficulties that they meet with in the way, but on the things that are not ſeen, the inviſible pleaſures of which they ſhall be made partakers in the end, they ſhould ſoon find cauſe enough <hi>of joy unſpeakable and glorious;</hi> yea, even amidſt the greateſt tribulation of this preſent life; you ſee how frolike the poor Worldling is, if he have gotten a few thouſand pounds, and built a goodly houſe, and bought a little earth about it; and yet his title to it is ſo uncertain and unſound, that the very following night for ought he knows, the Lord may turn him out of all, and take away his ſoul from him, and make him roar in Hell before the morning. But you who by the hand and ſeal, and earneſt of the Lord himſelf, have a moſt certain ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to that happineſs and joy which neither tongue of men or Angels can

expreſs, if you have but a wicked diſobedient child, a froward wife, a ſickly body, or a low eſtate, do waſte away your lives in heavineſs and diſcontent, and ſo you undervalue heaven, and the incomparable riches of Chriſts mercy to your ſouls. And whence proceedeth this, but from the fleſhineſs of your corrupt hearts, while you walk by ſenſe only? and therefore I beſeech you, take a little pains to make your ſelves conceive and underſtand your happineſs, and ſpend a little time upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the bleſſedneſs that is reſerved for you in the heavens, and this will draw and ſwallow up your preſent ſorrows and afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt would have his people full of holy joy? you <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> then who have your hearts repleniſhed with it, take heed that neither ſin nor Satan ſteal away this Jewel from you, which is the legacy that Chriſt bequeathed you when he was even about to leave this world. But firſt, before I preſs you any further in this kind, this caution would be fitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed; be ſure the joy you have be Chriſts joy, the joy which he works by his Spirit, which he would have you to be full of, and that you have <hi>his joy fulfilled in your ſelves;</hi> for you muſt know my Brethren, that as there is a kind of joy that is a fruit and effect of the Spirit, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. ſo there is another kind that is a fruit and effect of the fleſh; there is a laughter that is madneſs, a rejoycing that is not good, as the Apoſtle hath it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.16. And <hi>nulla eſt verior miſeria quam falſa laetitia:</hi> There is no truer miſery then falſe joy and feigned felicity. A very hypocrite may have his raptures and flaſhes of exceeding comfort. The ſecond ground you know received the Word of God with joy; and thoſe that followed <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>rejoyced in his ſight;</hi> and ſuch as after fall away, may find a kind of taſte and ſweetneſs in the Word of God, and in the powers of the world to come. And therefore we had need to prove the joy and comfort that we have, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Chriſts joy, the joy which he works in his people by his Spirit. The marks to try it may be ſuch as follow.</p>
                  <p>The joy of Chriſt which he works by his Spirit, is chiefly moved <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with ſpiritual things: It's true, there is a joy allowable for earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; as when the Lord vouchſafes us rain and fruitful ſeaſons, and the like; in doing ſo he fills our hearts with joy and gladneſs, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.17. But this is as if we rejoyced not, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.30. it is not worthy to be named with the joy that ariſeth from the ſenſe of the favour of God and ſpiritual bleſſings conferred on our ſouls. Here then examine, my Beloved, when your joy is moſt; when you are freed from ſome affliction, or when you have obtained conqueſt over ſome corruption? when inward grace, or elſe when outward wealth, when Corn and Wine, and Oyl increaſeth? Alas, how evidently do the greateſt part of men diſcover the unfoundneſs of their joy? who take abundantly more comfort in theſe outward things, the thriving of their Trades, their ſpeeding of their pleaſures and paſt-times, then in the thriving of the means of grace, or any other thing that moſt eſpecially concerns Gods glory or the Churches good? They make it to appear where lies the toot and Fountain of their joy, and conſequently of what kind it is, which if they be deprived of their riches, or honors, their hearts like <hi>Nabal</hi>
                     <pb n="350" facs="tcp:46169:198"/>
dye within them, their joy is daſhed, and their comfort gone. Whereas the Saint of Chriſt whoſe heart is filled with ſpiritual joy, retains it in a meaſure in the loſs of earthly things, and profeſſeth with the Prophet <hi>Habbakuk,</hi> chap. 3.17. <hi>Though the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall there be any fruit in the Vine, if the labour of the Olive fail, and the field yeild no meat; if the Flock be cut off from the fold, and there be no Herd in the ſtall, yet I will rejoyce in the Lord; yea, I will joy in the God of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The joy of Chriſt which he works by his Spirit, proceeds from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience teſtifying good, and not from a conſcience teſtifying nothing. <hi>For our rejoycing,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. There is as <hi>Barnard</hi> ſtiles it, <hi>Conſcientia mala &amp; quieta,</hi> an evill conſcience that is quiet, which being lulled aſleep by Satan, ſaith nothing to diſquiet him that owns it, and ſo he lives as jocund and as metry for a time as he whoſe heart moſt really acquitteth him from any thing that may diſturb or interrupt his joy. But yet this kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, beauſe it comes from nothing elſe but a Vacation in the Court of Conſcience, (if I may call it ſo) a reſpit of the accuſations there, is moſt uncertain and unfound. Aſſoon as term begins again, when Satan as he ſeeth occaſion, ſhall ſet the ſins of ſuch a man before his face, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſhall awaken and accuſe, that joy and comfort will be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſorrow, yea into ſuch tormenting pangs of horror, that no tongue is able to expreſs. But if thy joy ariſe from a conſcience teſtifying good, that in ſimplicity and ſincerity of heart, thou haſt had thy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in the world, this is the joy that Chriſt would have fulfilled in thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The joy of Chriſt which he works by his Spirit, hath its matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and not without the perſon rejoycing. There be many (my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) That have nothing in themſelves, whereof they have a juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to rejoyce, and therefore ſeek it up and down without. And from this kind of joy the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> diſſwadeth as unſound, Gal. 6.4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work, and he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now men are ſaid to rejoyce in another, eſpecially in two caſes: As firſt, when they compare themſelves with ſuch as are extremely vitious and prophane, and finding that themſelves are not ſo bad as many others are, they cheer and comfort up themſelves with this, as the Phariſee did, <hi>I thank thee God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I am no extortioner,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican,</hi> Luk. 18.11. and yet they may be bad enough for all this. And ſecondly, when men take comfort only in the good opinion that others have conceived of them, and not in any good that hath a true and real being in themſelves. And this St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuggeſteth is a falſe deceitful joy, and therefore preſſeth <hi>every man to prove his own work,</hi> to ſift and try his own actions; and if on tryal they be good indeed, then he hath ground and matter to <hi>rejoyce in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and not in another</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now my Brethren, are there not too many ſuch among us, who when they look on drunkards, whoremongers, blaſphemers, and men
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:46169:198"/>
of the moſt infamous and vitious lives, that paſs them and exceed them in prophaneſs, take joy and comfort in themſelves, but never prove their own works, their own lives. And thus while they compare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with others more looſe and vitious then themſelves, they rejoyce in another and not in themſelves; they think themſelves are very good, becauſe others are more evil. And even as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> juſtified <hi>Sodom, Ezek.</hi> 16.5. ſo drunkards and adulterers juſtifie them, and are oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their joy. Others there are who finding that they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good opinion and repute with others, and that they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by men of judgement, and of conſcience too, are comforted in this exceedingly; and here is the foundation of their Joy: Oh ſuch a godly man, or ſuch a Miniſter approves of them, and is familiar to them; and hence it comes to paſs that when they once begin to loſe the good opinion and conceit of men, they are like perſons ſtracken in the head, their joy is blaſted and their comfort gone, becauſe the ground and matter of it was without, and not within. O then let us endeavour my Beloved, to have our comfort in our ſelves; and if it have a ſpring and fountain in the heart, it will not fail; there will be a ſufficient ſupply of joy and comfort there, though men neglect us, and caſt away their good opinion of us: Whereas if it proceed from that which is without us, it will be like a ſtanding Pool that is not nouriſhed with the Spring, but with a ſodain fall of rain; aſſoon as heat of Summer comes, away it dryeth and is ſeen no more.</p>
                  <p>And now my Brethren, having proved your joy, and found it to be right, the joy of Chriſt, which he would have to be fulfilled in you, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it as your lives, and ſee that neither ſin nor Satan ſteal away this jewel from you; and to this end, you muſt eſpecially beware of ſinning againſt Conſcience, which is the ſubject and the ſeat of joy. As long as you do well to Conſcience, Conſcience will ſay well to you; but if you wound your Conſcience with the guilt of ſin, Conſcience will wound you with the horror and the ſting of ſin; and if by ſinning againſt light you waſte your Conſcience in regard of grace, Conſcience will waſte you in regard of peace and comfort: yea, it may ſet you on the rack of ſuch affrightments as no tongue is ſufficient to expreſs. What was the cauſe that <hi>David</hi> cryed ſo often in his bones, and in his heart, that they were broken, that it was melted in the midſt of his bowels, but becauſe he ſinned ſo groſly againſt the light of his own underſtanding, and the convictions of his own conſcience? But if in ſincerity you have your converſation in the world, this will be your rejoycing. And if you walk according to the rule, <hi>peace ſhall be upon you as upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> This joy of Chriſt ſhall be fulfilled in you, and your joy ſhall none take from you.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have diſpatched the firſt and ſecond Obſervation; Chriſt is the Author and Original of the joy of his people; Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to be full of holy joy.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE 3.</hi> Their clear and perfect knowledge of his interceſsion for them, is one eſpecial means to fill them full of this joy.</head>
                  <p>It is the means our Saviour uſes in my text, and certainly it is avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this end. That he might cheer the hearts of his Diſciples, and repleniſh them with comfort, he lets them hear him pleading for them to his Father. He doth it in their preſence, and while they are liſtning to him, as being very well aſſured that this will make their joy abound, and overflow the banks. And this is the account he gives his Father of the buſineſs, having been very earneſt with him to keep them through his own name, as he himſelf had done, as long as he had been among them, and urged many things in their behalf. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſpeak in the world,</hi> before I come away to thee, I ſpeak them here among theſe men for whom I am a Suitor to thee, in the ears of my Apoſtles and Diſciples, who are by and liſten to me, that being witneſſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to my importunate and earneſt interceſsion for them, they may by this means, <hi>have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True, you will ſay; this was an extraordinary comfort to them for the preſent; but what was this to them after Chriſt was gone from them? Or what it this to us in theſe times?</p>
                  <p>Yes, my beloved, it was much to them, even after Chriſts departure for the fulfilling of their joy: For when he was aſcended into heaven, they could on all occaſions, reflect upon the prayer that they heard him make in their behalf, while he was converſant upon the earth: when they were in any fear or any danger, when they were even ready to be overcome with grief and ſorrow, they could conſider with themſelves, We perfectly remember that while our Maſter was among us, we heard him earneſtly beſeech his Father for us, that he would keep us, and that he would Comfort us, and that he would Sanctifie us, and that he would ſave us, (as all thoſe things and many more you ſhall obſerve along the Current of his prayer here,) and we ſhall ſurely find the fruit of it in ſuch a time as this is. Yea, we have reaſon to believe that what he did for us, in a way of interceſſion, while he was here upon the earth, he doth the ſame in heaven to this day, and will do till we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to that place. And why then ſhould we not be cheerfull in the midſt of theſe troubles? And this our Saviour cleerly aims at in the words, <hi>Theſe things ſpeak I in the world, while I am yet among them, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves:</hi> That hearing what I do now while I am here, they might a little gueſs what I am like to do hereafter, when I am once ſate down at the right hand of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an everlaſting Interceſſor or for them; and therefore might be full of comfort, yea though I am departing from them, while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with themſelves, If he do ſo much now, ſurely when he comes to heaven, he will do much more.</p>
                  <p>And as for us who live in theſe times, it is a means to fill us full of comfort too, Chriſts ſpeaking theſe things in the world, and ſo giving
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:46169:199"/>
us a taſte of his future interceſſion: For hence it comes to paſs that this prayer of our Saviour being uttered in the ears of his Apoſtles, it is pend accordingly, and left upon record in Scripture. And ſo we have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen, a form, a modell of our Saviours interceſſion for his people, which he hath left behind him, for us to look upon on all occaſions, and to gather comfort from. What he doth in heaven for us, we are not able fully and exactly to diſcover. But this he did on earth before he went; he did it openly, and there is a memorial of it, for ever, in the Church. And by this we may conjecture what he doth in heaven for his people at this day, and will do to the worlds end. For certainly he is not leſs regardfull of them now in Heaven (which is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of acting the ſecond part of his Mediatorſhip which conſiſts in interceſſion) then he was upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>So that whatever our Condition be, how ſad or ſorrowfull ſoever, if we would know our Saviours interceſsion what it is for us in heaven, we may ſurvey this counterpane thereof on earth, which is recorded for this very end, That we may have an exemplar, and a pattern of it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually lying by us in the Scripture to have recourſe unto, and to fetch overflowing comforts from in all caſes.</p>
                  <p>Now to cleer this a little further to you, I ſhall proceed to ſhew you in a few particulars, that the perfect knowledge of our Saviours interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is one eſpecial means to fill his people full of holy joy.</p>
                  <p>It is a means to comfort them exceedingly in reference to all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of their enemies, whether without them or within them. Do you not think it was a comfort to the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had got a Champion to ſtand up for them, againſt the daring inſolencies of <hi>Goliah,</hi> who had ſo long defied the armies of the living God? It made them even ſhout for joy. And ſo it is a comfort to the poor ſoul, when he hath been long contending with the world which ſets upon him mightily with all its blandiſhments and its allurements on the one ſide, and with its threats and perſecutions on the other ſide, and with the Devil who fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aſſaults him with his fiery darts, and his violent temptations, and with his own corruptions and his luſts, that warr againſt the ſoul as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: And when he is about to faint and ſink away, he conſiders with himſelf, Why though I have all theſe againſt me, yet I have Jeſus Chriſt for me, and he is pleading-hard on my behalf, that I may not have the worſt in theſe Encounters, but that I may be more then a Conqueror. I ſeem to hear him ſaying to me, Theſe enemies of thine have deſired to winnow thee, and to deſtroy thee, <hi>but I have prayed for thee that thy faith may not fail;</hi> Thy courage and thy ſtrength may fail a little, but thy faith ſhall never fail. When Chriſt was here upon the earth, he earneſtly beſought his Father for me, <hi>that he would keep me through his own name:</hi> and what he did on earth, I know he doth in heaven much more; and he cannot be denyed. So that I am as ſafe as the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power of God can make me.</p>
                  <p>Oh what a matchleſs comfort and encouragement is this! The poor perplexed ſoul but now was toſsing on the boyſtrous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of violent temptations, and of raging paſsions, and of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:46169:200"/>
luſts, and even ready to be caſt away: But now as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, the ſoul is glad becauſe it is at reſt, and it is brought to the deſired haven. Ah my beloved, when a man who is mightily aſſaulted by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and temptations, and perſecutions and afflictions, and when the ſtones and buffets are about his ſoul, can look up as <hi>Stephen</hi> did, Acts 7.56. <hi>and ſee the heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of God,</hi> this cannot chooſe but fill him full of comfort. Nay ſayes the ſoul, If thou art there pleading for me to the Father, and ſtanding up in my defence, I know it is impoſsible that I ſhould periſh or miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The knowledge of our Saviours Interceſsion for his people, is a means to comfort them in reference to all the accuſations that are laid againſt us at the barr of Gods juſtice. The Law comes in with a black bill againſt us, layes very heavy things to our charge, and taxes us with many grievous violations of it, which we are no way able to deny; <hi>Sathan</hi> for his part, is the grand accuſer of the brethren, and he objecteth heynous things againſt us, and layes it on with full load; And then our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences perhaps accuſe us, as faſt as any of the other two. They are not able to gainſay the allegations, either of Sathan or the Law, but are forced to acknowledge, that all the curſes that are written in the Book of God, are very juſtly due to us. What ſhall we do, or how ſhall we keep up our hearts from ſinking into utter deſperation in ſuch a caſe as this is? As for our parts, we have nothing to alledge in, or of, or from our ſelves, why the ſentence of the Law ſhould not be pronounced againſt us; But this is that which fills us full of Comfort, that Jeſus Chriſt hath enough to ſay for us, and that he ſits in heaven for this very end to make interceſsion for us, when any thing comes in againſt us there, to appear in our behalf, and to plead our cauſe. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 John 2.2. <hi>and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> We have ſuch an Advocate as is a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So that when Sathan, and when ſin accuſes, and makes a dreadfull noiſe againſt us, he can wipe all off again with one word: Saith he. This perſon hath offended, I confeſs; but what of that? There is a full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation made, it is well known that I have done it; and what hath any one to ſay to this man? If he have out-ſinned my ſatisfaction, even let him be condemned. But if not, let him be acquitted; or what do I ſit here for? How can this chooſe but raviſh and tranſport the ſoul into an Extaſie of joy, and make it to triumph with the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.33. <hi>Who can lay anything to my charge? who is he that condemneth?</hi> Let me but ſee the man that durſt to do it. So that no marvail though our Saviour Chriſt be called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the forecited place, which ſignifieth both a <hi>Comforter</hi> and <hi>Advocate:</hi> To ſhew that Jeſus Chriſt doth comfort us exceedingly, by undertaking for us as an Advocate, and pleading for us with the Father.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The knowledge of our Saviours Interceſſion for his people is a means to comfort them in reference to the many weakneſſes and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our own prayers. Oh how are we dejected and caſt down ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when we are dull and flat and cold and ſpeechleſs in our addreſſes
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:46169:200"/>
to the Majeſty of God. When we are ſo deſerted, and our hearts are ſo ſhut up, that (as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> once) we cannot ſpeak in prayer, but only chatter like a Swallow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.14. when we know not what to ſay, nor what to plead, we are ſo barren; when we are deſtitute of matter and expreſſion, this puts us many times into a very ſad condition and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms our hearts with ſorrow; As <hi>David</hi> once complained in ſuch a caſe, Pſal. 77.3. <hi>I remembred God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I was troubled; I complained and my ſpirit was overwhelmed.</hi> But now, my brethren, is it not a matter of exceeding comfort to conſider that we have an Interceſſor to help us out with all this? That he puts in to God the Father for us, and takes our Suites into his hands; That he excuſes what is wanting in our prayers, and ſupplies it in his own; That he is lively there where we are dull; that he is quick where we are flat; that he is full where we are ſhort. My Clyent, ſaith our Advocate, means this and this; this is the meaning of the ſpirit in him. He is not able to expreſs himſelf as many others can, but this is that which he intends and aims at. His words are not ſo ready and ſo apt, but he hath as ſincere a heart as the moſt voluble and fluent of them all: and he is one for whom I have laid down my life, and ſhed my blood, for whom I have deſerved all the good that he can ask and ſtand in need of; And therefore I beſeech thee Father, let him have what he deſires, give him a ſpeedy and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious anſwer for my ſake. Ah my beloved, is it not able to fill our hearts brimfull of joy, when we remember that we have ſuch an Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate as this is?</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of our Saviours Interceſſion for his people, is a means <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to comfort them in reference to the defects of all our graces. For we come ſhort in all of them, there is not one of them compleat. There is much lacking in our faith, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. and ſo there is in all the reſt which ſpring from faith. For if there be a failing in the root, there cannot chooſe but be a failing in the branches. And this is that which makes us walk ſo heavily and ſadly many times, when we conſider with our ſelves how ſlender the degrees and meaſures of our graces are, ſo that we know not where to find comfort. What ſhall we do in ſuch a caſe to keep our ſpirits from deſpondency? Why truly among many other wayes, this is a very ſpecial one to fix our thoughts upon the interceſsion of our Saviour for us, and to conſider ſeriouſly with our ſelves, that this is one great buſineſs that he urges to his Father, that he would ſanctifie his people; That he would give them out more grace, and more holineſs. This prayer of our Saviour in my text, as I have hinted formerly, is but a Counterpane of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual interceſsion that he makes for his in heaven. And it conſiſts eſpecially of two branches, which comprehend the two main things that he deſireth of his Father for his people, Preſervation and Sanctification. The latter he is large upon, <hi>ſanctifie them with thy truth,</hi> and ſo on. They were ſanctified before, for they were not of the world, and he deſires they might be ſanctified yet more; That they might have larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all the graces of the ſpirit. And is not this an extraordinary
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:46169:201"/>
comfort to thoſe who are but meanly furniſhed, and who have but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtock of grace, that Jeſus Chriſt is alwayes interceding to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their behalf for a more full ſupply? It was a ſuit that he begun on earth, and he is ſtill purſuing it in heaven to this day, and will do to the worlds end, he will never give it over; ſo that we may be confident we ſhall have ſuch degrees of holineſs and grace beſtowed upon us, as are neceſſary for us.</p>

What our Saviour doth in heaven in a way of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, if it were unknown to us, though it might profit us and benefit us very much, it could not comfort as at all. But when we know that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſuch a ſingular regard to us, and that his heart and his affections work towards us ſo ſweetly, and ſo ſtrongly now he is in heaven, at ſo great a diſtance from us (I mean as he is man) that he is always taking all advantages, to further and promote our buſineſs with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſpeaking to him upon all occaſions for our good; and in a word, that he is ſo extremely kind and loving to us, ſo infinitely tender of our welfare every way; This cannot chooſe if it be duly weighed, but fill our hearts up to the brim, and make them over-flow with joy.</p>

We are here in an unquiet and unſtable world, in which we meet with many cauſes of diſcomfort from within, and from without, and many times they take extremely deep upon us, ſo as almoſt to make our lives a burthen to us. Now if we would be free from ſuch diſtempers, let us endeavour to look more into our Saviours Interceſſion. And if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it well, it will fill us full of comfort, that will ſwell high, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly above all the afflictions of this preſent life. Indeed the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of our Saviour is of it ſelf a large volume, too much for us to read over, and that Volume ſealed too, ſhut up in heaven, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open it, or look into it: But he hath given us a brief <hi>compendium,</hi> and a ſhort abridgement of it, in the Prayer that he made for his Apoſtles and Diſciples, and in them for all the Church, that is or ſhall be to the worlds end, that we may read it and acquaint our ſelves with it: He ſpake that prayer in the world, that they might hear it from him, and ſo might have his joy fulfilled in them: And that we might hear it from them, and ſo might have his joy fulfilled in us. In which regard, my Brethren, it is left upon record in publique in the Church for ever, that all his people might have recourſe thereto, on all occaſions for their Comfort. And therefore when we are in any trouble, when ſorrow ſeizes deep upon us, let us ſtudy this prayer in all the parts and branches of it, that from thence we may conjecture what he doth in our behalf, now he is fitting at the right hand of his Father. And this let us depend upon, that if he ſpake one word in our behalf in any caſe while he was here upon earth, he ſpeaks a hundred for us now he is heaven. And truly if this Counterpane of our Saviours Interceſſion were dived into and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:46169:201"/>
ſtudied more, there would be more holy joy among the Saints. Their troubles and their ſorrows would be leſs, and they would be more full of comfort then they are.</p>

               <p>AND thus of the firſt argument, with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth his Petition to his Father in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that he himſelf would undertake the keeping of them: Which hath been taken as you may remember, from his own ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual preſervation of them, during the time that he had been among them: Together with the reaſon which he interpoſes why he made this Petition for them in the world.</p>
               <p>Proceed we to the ſecond argument with which he backs it, and it is taken from the place in which he was about to leave them, wherein he was aſſured they would ſtand in need of ſpecial preſervation from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And therefore he deſireth him to keep them through his own Name, becauſe our Saviour for his own part, was even ready to depart from them, and to abandon them in ſuch a place, where they would be in danger every day, and every hour, as being hated and maligned upon all hands, and that for the truths ſake. <hi>I have given them thy Word, and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the words have in them a diſcovery of the condition and eſtate of Chriſts Diſciples in the world, together with the cauſes of it. Firſt the condition and eſtate of Chriſts Diſciples in the world is mentioned here, although not in the firſt place: and it is ſuch as cannot but be grievous and uncomfortable to them; For they are very ill beloved; yea, they are hated univerſally almoſt; <hi>the world hath hated them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And then the cauſes of it are annexed, by what means it comes to paſs that they are ſo maligned in the world; and this is not for any evill that is in them, or done by them. But either firſt, becauſe they receive the Word of God, not into their knowledge only, but into their practice and obedience too; <hi>I have given them thy Word, and the world hath hated them:</hi> So that it hates them for the Word, and for the Truths ſake. And ſecondly becauſe they are not of this world, but of another; therefore the world is ſo envenomed, and ſo malitiouſly bent againſt them: <hi>The world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> They like them much the worſe, becauſe they are in this reſpect like me. At this time let us look into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and eſtate of Chriſts Diſciples in the world, <hi>the world hates them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The world is taken divers ways; I think more differently then any other phraſe almoſt in Scripture. Sometimes we find it uſed for elect and ſanctified; ſometimes for reprobate and unſanctified perſons. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:46169:202"/>
for the elect and ſanctified, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, Joh. 4.42. <hi>This is the Chriſt the Saviour of the world,</hi> that is, of all the choſen and elect of God, not limited to <hi>Jewry</hi> only, but whereſoever ſcattered over all the world. <hi>God was in Chriſt</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. Not all the world at large, but all his choſen people, whatſoever, or whereſoever living in the world. Sometimes the world is taken for reprobate and unſanctified men: So that, <hi>The world lies in wickedneſs,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.19. as <hi>Auſtin</hi> intimateth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, there is <hi>mundus mundus, &amp; mundus inmundus.</hi> Indeed it is ſo differently taken, that ſometimes they that are hated, are the world; and ſometimes they that hate them, are the world: And in this latter ſenſe, you are to underſtand it in my Text: <hi>The world,</hi> that is, the reprobate and wicked of the world, <hi>hath hated them,</hi> ſaith: our Saviour to his Father; <hi>The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> It is the manner of the world to hate them that are Chriſts Diſciples.</head>
                  <p>They that belong to Jeſus Chriſt are uſually but ill-beloved among ungodly and unſanctified men. The world is generally ſet againſt them, to malign them and oppoſe them, and do them all the ſpite and miſchief that they can. So it was in Chriſts time, and ſo it will be to the worlds end: And therefore it is made the Epithite of wicked men that they are ſuch as hate the righteous; you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.21. They are not only angry with them, but they hate them, and that to the very death. They deſire their extirpatation and deſtruction, that they may have no more a being; no nor ſo much as the memorial of a being, if it might be poſſible, <hi>that their name may be no mere remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred,</hi> Pſal. 83.4. And therefore you ſhall find the Saints complaining of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the hatred of the world, and of the rage and malice of ungodly men againſt them. And Chriſt fore-warning his Diſciples what they muſt expect in this world, <hi>You ſhall be hated,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>of all Nations,</hi> Mat. 24.9. That ſeems to be very much; yet in another place he goes further; <hi>You ſhall be hated of all men;</hi> you muſt conceive it of all worldly wicked men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22. I ſhall add no more for proof; you ſee it is the manner of the wicked world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what ſhould be the reaſon why they hate them ſo? It may be you will ask as <hi>David</hi> once, <hi>What hath the righteous done?</hi> what evil hath he wrought? what have Chriſts Diſciples done, that they are ſo maligned in the world? Why truly, my Beloved, if you would know the reaſon of it, it is not for any evil they have done, that they are ſo railed at, and that they have ſo much ill will on all hands; there is no juſt and real cauſe of all this hatred which they ſuffer from the world: No, my Beloved, as they hated Chriſt himſelf without a cauſe, as <hi>David</hi> once complained as
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:46169:202"/>
his Type, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.19. ſo they hate Chriſts Diſciples too, thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt, without a cauſe, without any juſt cauſe. So that you ſee here is a Doctrine, of which no man in the world can give you one good reaſon. It is the manner of the wicked world to hate them that are Chriſts Diſciples; but it is without reaſon, without any good reaſon: However they have reaſons to themſelves, ſuch as they are, of this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. And I might give you many ſuch reaſons, more then a good many: For though there be not any reaſons why they ſhould, yet there are many reaſons why they do hate Chriſts Diſciples, and I might be large upon them: But I ſhall confine my ſelf to thoſe which Chriſt hath mentioned in the Text it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The wicked world hates Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe they entertain the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Word of God, becauſe they love it and obey it, and conform their lives to it; and this is the account our Saviour gives his Father of the buſineſs, <hi>I have given them thy Word, and the world hath hated them;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid for that cauſe: I have ſo given them thy Word, that they have entertained it as thy Word in their faith, and love, and practice, and obedience; and hence it is that they are ſo maligned, and deſpite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entreated in the world. And ſo it is at this day; As long as men make no account and reckoning of the Word, as long as they profeſs it only, but are not very zealous for it, nor very careful to walk in every thing exactly by it, they may live pretty quiet with their neighbors: But if they come once to contend, and that with earneſtneſs for every truth that is contained in the Word; if they will not in any caſe, by any means depart in any thing from that Rule, the world will be about their ears up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſodain, and ſhew a great deal of malignity and rage againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But why ſhould this exaſperate the world againſt them, you will ask me? I cannot tell you why it ſhould, but I will tell you why it doth: For by this means they croſs the world, and they condemn and ſhame the world. And this is that which ſets the world ſo much againſt them.</p>
                  <p>By this means they croſs the world; and this they are not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it makes their very hearts to riſe againſt them: And they croſs them three ways, they croſs them in their judgements, and they croſs them in their wills, and they croſs them in their lives and converſations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt by this means they croſs them in their judgements and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Till men receive the Word of God, they can in every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their judgements and opinions to the world. They can think as they do, and they can ſpeak as they do; they can agree and hold with them in every point, and ſo they walk on lovingly together; there grows no difference or debate between them. But when they come to entertain the Word to be their rule in every thing, both in opinion and in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, now they are forced to differ from the world, to claſh with them, in many things to contradict and oppoſe them, and gain-ſay them. And this breeds diſaffection and diſlike, yea enmity and hatred againſt them: Nay, they are forced ſometimes, if they will keep exactly to the Word of God, to croſs the world in thoſe opinions which they are moſt intent upon, and for which they are moſt eager; and this they can by no means bear from them: As they that entertained Chriſt to be the Son of God,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:46169:203"/>
and the Saviour of the world, when he was converſant upon the Earth, and in the times that followed next after his Incarnation, Paſſion and Aſcenſion, they did exceedingly enrage the world againſt them: The generality of men would not endure to heat of Chriſt, or the Religion that embraced and worſhipped him; and therefore whoſoever undertook to own him and profeſs him, was ſure to meet with all the violence and rage and malice that the world could pour upon him. He might have croſt the world in many other truths, and not have found ſo ill meaſure; but this drew out their rage and malice to the utmoſt: And this is that (as I conceive) which our Saviour Chriſt aims particularly at in my text, <hi>I have given them thy Word,</hi> thy Goſpel Word; of that he ſpeaks, and they have entertained it and embraced it, and therefore <hi>the world hates them.</hi> And if you look into the ſtories of the Church, you ſhall obſerve that whoſoever cloſed with the Goſpel in thoſe early times, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the faith of Chriſt, from which the world was ſo exceedingly averſe, he was expoſed thereby to all the miſery that humane cruelty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> could deviſe to inflict.</p>
                  <p>But after when this Goſpel-Truth came to be better ſetled and digeſted in the world, ſo that they were content to hear of Chriſt and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with a little patience, then there roſe up other things in which they would not be gain-ſaid: As to leap down to <hi>Luther,</hi> time, who ever ſtuck to him, and to the doctrine which he taught, againſt the Pope and his adherents, got the world about his ears. And ſo in every age, there are ſome paſſages of holy Scripture, and the truths delivered in them, againſt which the world is violently bent: and whoſoever ſticks to theſe, the world hates him out of meaſure, and doth him all the miſchief that it can. And therefore this is called the Word of Gods patience, Apoc. 3.10. <hi>Thou haſt kept the Word of my patience;</hi> that is, thou haſt not only kept my Word in general, but more particularly thou haſt kept thoſe portions of my Word, and thoſe parcels of my Truth, which muſt have patience to the keeping of them. A man may keep ſome Truths deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Word without patience, as being univerſally received by all, oppoſed by none: But there are others, which if a man maintain and hold them, he ſhall ſurely ſuffer, he ſhall be perſecuted for them. And he that keeps theſe notwithſtanding, keeps the Word of Gods patience. The patience which God works in his people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They that embrace the Word of God, as they croſs the wicked world in their opinions, ſo they croſs them in their wills: They cannot do in every thing as the wicked world would have them; they cannot yeild to every thing, which they obtrude and force upon them, and this is another reaſon why they are ſo exaſperated and enraged againſt them. Were it not for the Word of God, to which they are reſolved to yield obedience, they might comply in every thing, and ſo the world and they might be very good freinds. But when the Word forbiddeth what the world requireth, &amp; that moſt vehemently too perhaps, they are forced to croſs the world, and and ſo the Word brings the world and them out. Theſe men, ſay they, are ſo preciſe and holy, that they muſt have Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for every thing they ſay or do, they will do nothing but what they
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:46169:203"/>
have a warrant for out of the Word of God. But we will make them ſtoop and yield, and we will make them turn another leaf ere we have done: and when they cannot have their wills, becauſe the other cannot bend or vary from the Word of God when they are croſt in that which they are ſo reſolved upon, this heats the furnace of their wrath ſeven times hotter then ordinary: and this the Prophet <hi>David</hi> found, Pſal. 119.161. <hi>Princes have perſecuted me without a cauſe; but my heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word:</hi> Either he muſt have them againſt him, or the Word of God againſt him. They threatned him if he obeyed the Word: the Word upon the other ſide, that threatned if he diſobeyed it. Whom did he fear moſt? why ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>My heart ſtandeth in awe of thy Word;</hi> I fear it more then I fear them: And this was that which got him much hatred and bitter perſecution too, as you may ſee in that place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that receive the Word of God, as they croſs the wicked world in their opinions and their wills, ſo in their converſations too; they do not live and walk as they do; their ways are of another faſhion, and this is another reaſon why the world is ſo malitiouſly bent againſt them. Were it not for the Word of God, and the rules that it preſcribes, there need to be no difference between them and other men, and ſo there would be no diſlike. But now they are not, neither can they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and faſhiond to the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. they cannot walk according to the courſe and cuſtom of the world <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. The world runs out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly into all licentious courſes, but they run not out with them. They walk not as the Gentiles, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. they ſleep not as do others, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.5. And this the world cannot abide them for, becauſe they are ſo ſingular, and will not do as they do.</p>
                  <p>They that receive the Word of God, as they do croſs the world, ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they condemn and ſhame the world: For while they walk exactly by the Rule, their holy and unblemiſht lives and converſations do make the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and licentious courſes of ungodly men the more odious, and bring the more contempt upon them. And as the righteous is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, becauſe he dwelleth by a bad neighbour; ſo on the other ſide, the wicked is the more abominable, becauſe he dwelleth by a good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; his vile and wicked actions ſhew the worſe, becauſe there are ſo good examples juſt by.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen the firſt reaſon of the point; the wicked world hates Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe they entertain the Word of God, <hi>I have given them thy Word,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a ſecond alſo added in the Text, It is the manner of the world <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> to hate them that are Chriſts diſciples, <hi>becauſe they are not of this world</hi> but of another. Therefore the world is ſo envenomed, and ſo malitiouſly bent againſt them. <hi>The world hath hated them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world:</hi> If they were of their own ſociety, and of their own Countrey, they would love them well enough, as Chriſt himſelf informeth his Diſciples, Joh. 15.19. <hi>If ye were of the world, the world would love his own, but becauſe ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Is it the manner of the wicked world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then you ſee one eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reaſon why Chriſts Diſciples are ſo vilified and abuſed in the world. They dwell among a company of men that hate them, and that to the very death. And hence it is my brethren, that they do them all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that they can: It is a wonder to us, many times, that all the world almoſt ſhould be upon the skirts of the ſmall number that belongs to Chriſt, that they ſhould be continually perking at them, and raiſing ſcandalous reports upon them; we know not what to make of it. Why, whats the matter, think we, that they ſhould be ſo ill-entreated, and ſo unworthily and baſely uſed on all hands? Truly nothing elſe but this, the world hates them; and all theſe injuries, and wrongs, and moleſtations are the effects of that hatred.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Is it the manner of the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the greater cauſe there is of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the power and mercy of the Lord that keeps them, and preſerves them, notwithſtanding this hatred. Though all the world be bitterly envenomed and enraged againſt them, they cannot have their will upon them; no, they are ſafeguarded ſtill, as if a little Lamb were kept among a company of Wolves and Lions. Tis not for want of multitude or malice in the enemies of Chriſts Diſciples, that they have yet a being in the world, but by the power and goodneſs of a gratious God, upholding them, and providing for their ſafety. <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes;</hi> And we ſhall marvail at it, and admire the Lord the more, if we conſider yet a little more diſtinctly but theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The diſparity in number between Chriſts Diſciples and them that bear ſuch mortal hatred to them; For Chriſts Diſciples they are very few, a little flock, a ſmall number, a petty inconſiderable company of men. But they that hate them, and deſire their ruine, are the world, a world of wicked and ungodly men. So that you ſee, there are enemies enough to eat up Chriſts people, (as <hi>David</hi> ſaid they did in his time, <hi>They eat up thy people, as a man would eat bread</hi>) to devour them, and to bring them all to nothing in a moment. And if you do compare them with the multitude that are againſt them, and conſider what a deadly and enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed hatred they bear againſt them, their preſervation will appear to be a ſtrange thing, the greater and more admirable is the power that keeps them and upholds them in ſuch a poſture and condition as this is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as there is a great diſparity in number between Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and them that bear ſuch hatred to them, ſo in diſpoſition too, which magnifies the power that keeps them yet more. For Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples they are frequently compared to Sheep and Lambs, poor harmleſs things that are ſo far from being able or deſirous to offend &amp; hurt others, that they are no wayes able to defend themſelves. And they that hate them on the otherſide, are compared to Dogs, and Wolves, and Bears, and Lions. How eaſie is it for ſuch ſtrong and cruel creatures to make a prey upon the ſilly Lambs? So Chriſts Diſciples are reſembled to a Lilly for their tenderneſs and ſoftneſs; and they that hate them on the other ſide, to Thorns for their injurious and offenſive quality, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.2. They are ſharp, and rough, and boiſtrous; and theſe alas are
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:46169:204"/>
ſweet and harmleſs, and how ſhall they ſubſiſt among them? They are not like to hurt the world, but the world is very like to hurt them. Thorns you know, are apt to prick, and rent and ſcratch; and on the other ſide, the Lilly by reaſon of her tenderneſs, is very lyable to wrong and very capable of ſuch impreſsions. The Greater cauſe there is of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration at the power of God, by which the Church of Chriſt is kept, in ſuch a dangerous condition and eſtate as this is.</p>
                  <p>Is it the manner of the wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then ſurely it concerneth Chriſts <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>3</label> Diſciples to be very cautious how they walk in the midſt of ſuch men. If they were among their friends, there needed not ſuch curious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection. For friends will make the beſt of every thing, and conſtrue matters in the mildeſt and moſt favourable way.</p>
                  <p>But ſince they are amongſt their enemies that hate them, it ſtands them very much upon to look exactly to their words and wayes. And that upon a few Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>For, Firſt, if there be any thing to be miſconſtrued, they will be ſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to make an ill interpretation of it, they will miſtake your words (as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks) and miſtake your actions too, and turn them all the wrong way. Becauſe they hate you, they will lie upon the the catch, that they may pick ſome matter of exception and reproach againſt you. And if there be but any ſhew, or colour for it, they will glory out of meaſure as you may ſee <hi>Michal</hi> for an inſtance <hi>when</hi> David <hi>danced before the Ark.</hi> And therefore <hi>David</hi> calls them <hi>his obſervers, Pſal.</hi> 5.8. for ſo the Hebrew word imports, and ſo you find it in the Margine. And if they once get any matter by the end, Oh with what Joy and exultation will they vent it! Aha, ſay they, our eyes hath ſeen it, our ear hath heard it. And therefore we have need of wiſdom, yea the wiſdom of an Angel, to know how to demean our ſelves before ſuch perſons as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>Seconly, And as by reaſon of their hatred of you, they will be very <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> buſie, and inquiſitive, to catch at any thing againſt you. So if they find it in the leaſt degree; they will be ſure to make the moſt of it. They will be very carefull that it ſhall not loſe a Jot by their means. And therefore we have reaſon to be very wary of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing that may be capable of miſconſtruction, yea though we know it to be Lawfull; And to avoid the appearance of evil, That ſo theſe enemies of ours, who watch and hope to take us tripping, may be aſhamed, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.8. as being diſappointed of that which they expected and deſired. For ſhame you know, is the fruit of diſappointment, that they may be aſhamed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no evil thing to ſay of you.</p>
                  <p>If they can miſ-interpret any thing you ſay or do, they will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wound your names with it, but the name of God himſelf, and the credit of religion.</p>
                  <p>So that it is not a ſufficient Plea to ſay, that we are very well perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that we have done no evil, and therefore if they make an ill conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, the fault is theirs, and we muſt bear it, we cannot help it, we muſt endure their ſcandals and reproaches; No, my beloved, this is not enough, it ought to be our care, as much as lyes in us, to prevent
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:46169:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe ill Conſtructions, and to take away occaſion from thoſe that long and ſeek for it. For theſe reproaches do not reſt in us. If we alone did bear them, if they did reach no further then our perſons, it were well. But God and his Religion, and his Goſpel, are miſerably wounded through our ſides, by this occaſion; and therefore we muſt ſee that we do nothing, as far as it is poſſible, from whence theſe enemies of ours may take advantage to wound ſuch pretious things as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And as they will take occaſion, if there be any colour for it, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Gods name, ſo to undo and damn their own ſouls. If they find weakneſſes and flaws, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n thoſe who are Chriſts Diſciples, this ſets them off the further from religion. If they ſee them to fall ſhort, or take them tripping any way, in any thing that falls within their compaſs to diſcover, this ſtrangely hardens them againſt profeſſion. I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there are many ſouls in hell, who have been kept aloof from Chriſt, and from Religion, by the incircumſpect and careleſs walking of thoſe who have either been really, or have been taken to be Chriſts Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. And therefore let it be our care, that while we go to heaven with our friends, no enemies of ours may go to hell by our means.</p>

Only to ſtay them and ſupport them in ſuch a troubleſome condition, let them take notice of a few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God and Jeſus Chriſt love you, and love you very dearly, though the world hate you. And whether do you think the love of God will do you moſt good, or the hatred of the world will do you moſt hurt? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you my beloved, ſet the one in oppoſition to the other, and when you are diſquieted at any time, to think how you are hated and maligned and abuſed in the world, conſider on the other ſide, how you are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of God; how dear are you to Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who loved you and gave himſelf for you.</hi> And if you weigh the matter well, you will find infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater cauſe to cheer your hearts with his love, then to deject them with the worlds hatred.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was in the ſame condition with you when he lived in the world. You fare no worſe then he did. And this is that which he himſelf propounds to his Apoſtles and Diſciples to the very ſame end, <hi>John</hi> 15.18. <hi>If the world hate you,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>you know that it hated me before it hated you.</hi> Are you hated in the world? let not that ſeem ſtrange to you; you know your ſelves, it hated me before you, or elſe <hi>it hated me</hi> who am before you; <hi>It hated me</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>It hated me</hi> prius, <hi>or it hated me</hi> priorem, for it may be both wayes rendred. <hi>It hated me before you,</hi> in regard of time, or me who am before you
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:46169:205"/>
in regard of Dignity, as <hi>Calvin</hi> very well obſerves upon the place.</p>
                  <p>And ſhould not this Conſideration quiet us and make us patient? we are hated in the world; why ſo was Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Why ſhould we look to be exempted from that to which our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was expoſed? yea, he was hated in the firſt place, and we are hated after him, and in reference to him; Though he were abſolutely holy, harmleſs, ſeparate from ſinners, he was hated notwithſtanding. Alas, my brethren, how unholy, how faulty, how injurious many times are we to others? And then what wonder is it that they take offence at us? Though Chriſt were far above us every way, though he were our Lord and Maſter, he was exceedingly maligned in the world. And why ſhould we expect in this regard to be above him, to fare better then he did? No, let it be ſufficient for us, that we are no worſe, no nor ſo ill intreat-as our Lord and Maſter was.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The hatred of the world is no impediment at all, no barr, no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to your bleſſedneſs. Indeed, it fits you rather and qualifies you for it, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf inſinuates, in his Sermon on the Mount, Mat. 5.12. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all evil of you falſly.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> to the ſame effect, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. ſaith he, <hi>If you be reproached for the name of Chriſt, happy are you.</hi> So that malignity and injury, and evil uſage from the world, are no way inconſiſtent with our happineſs, neither with our preſent nor our future happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our preſent happineſs conſiſteth in the title that we have to Chriſt, the intereſt we have in him, and the Communion we have with him. Can the hatred of the world put an end to this Communion? No, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 3.35. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword?</hi> as it is written, <hi>for thy ſake are we killed all the day long. Nay, in all theſe things we are more then Conquerours through him that loves as. For I am verily perſwaded, that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heigth, not depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> Nay, to ſay truth, Chriſt loves us moſt, and hath moſt communion with us, when the world is moſt againſt us. Then he is ſpecially preſent with us, as he was with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 18.9. and with the Martyrs in the Dungeon, in the Stocks, in the flames. And it is certain that Chriſt doth then reveal himſelf moſt ſweetly to his people, when the world diſcovers moſt malignity and rage againſt them. So that it is not all their hatred can keep a Chriſtian from the love and fellowſhip of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo by Conſequence it cannot keep him from his preſent happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And for our happineſs to come, it cannot hinder that neither. It doth not lie ſo looſe, my brethren, that all the world can take it from us. No, it is in Gods keeping; he openeth and no man ſhutteth; he ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and no man openeth. He opened Heaven upon <hi>Stephen,</hi> when the world was ſhewing the utmoſt of its rage againſt him. And verily a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is as near the complement and the perfection of his happineſs, when
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:46169:206"/>
he ſuffers all the wrong and ignominy and contempt that the world can pour upon him, and ſometimes nearer then he is at other times; for that may be the way to it. And hence, ſaith Chriſt in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alledged text, Mat. 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men revile you; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and be exceeding glad,</hi> And why ſo? <hi>For great is your reward in heaven.</hi>

               <p>AND thus far of the ſecond Argument with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth his Petition to his Father in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that he would <hi>keep them through his own name, viz.</hi> becauſe our Saviour for his own part was even ready to depart from them, and to abandon them in ſuch a place where they were hated univerſally almoſt; <hi>the world hath hated them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Why then a man would think the only way were to remove them out of ſuch a place, where they are ſo ill beloved, and ſo maligned upon all hands. If the world hate them, becauſe they are not of the world, what ſhould they do there any longer? the beſt way were to take them thence, and to tranſlate them to a place where they are likely to have more quiet. No, ſaith our Saviour, I diſown that; that is not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and drift of my Petition, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that theſe words my brethren, are an Explication of that which is delivered in the former verſe, that it might not be miſtaken. Not that our Saviour was afraid his Father would miſtake his meaning, but he knew they might miſtake him, who heard him ſpeaking to his Father. And therefore as a learned Writer notes upon the text, he ſpeaks unto his Father as a man, for mens ſake, becauſe he ſpeaks in their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He tells them plainly and expreſly what he doth not pray for, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world.</hi> And then he tels him clearly what he doth pray for, <hi>but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Begin we with the firſt part of the explication, in which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our tells his Father plainly and expreſly what he doth not pray for; <hi>I do not pray that thou ſhould take them out of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that the point to be obſerved hence, is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> Removal out of this world, is not the proper ſubject matter of Petition.</head>
                  <p>You ſee our Saviour Chriſt diſowns it clearly in my text, he would by no means have it thought that he deſires his Father to remove his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:46169:206"/>
hence by death, to take them out of the world: No, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that is not the thing I pray for; <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world:</hi> And even as he diſowns it in his prayer, ſo ſhould we; for we muſt walk in every imitable thing, as we have him for an example: And out of doubt, he ſpeaks not this for the direction of his Father, that he might not be miſtaken (as I noted even now) but on the other ſide, for the inſtruction of his Apoſtles and Diſciples, who were by and heard him pray: That they might learn not to exceed their bounds in their petitions: And when they ſeriouſly conſider how they are hated, and maligned, and abuſed in the world, they might not yet deſire the Lord on this account, that he would take them hence, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he would preſerve and keep them here, as you have it in my Text; <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the ground is evident.<label type="milestone">

                     </label> Removal out of this world is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject matter of Petition, becauſe it is not ſimply in it ſelf a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Indeed by accident I muſt acknowledge death and departure hence, is turned exceed ngly to the advantage of the Saints. For by it they are freed from evils penal, and from evils ſinful; from ſuffering, and from ſinning; they are admitted to moſt near communion with him whom their ſoul loves, and whom their hearts do even gaſp after, from whoſe immediate preſence they are unavoidably debarred, as long as they remain in this world. But properly life and continuance in the body is the bleſſing, and therefore it is properly to be deſired. We find it uſually to be propounded in the promiſe, as the reward of holineſs, and of obedience. And in this form we have it in the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the firſt Commandment with promiſe, the only one that hath a promiſe of the ſecond Table, the only one of all the ten that hath a diſtinct and particular promiſe. And now you will expect, I know, there ſhould be ſome tranſcendent mercy comprehended in ſuch a ſingular and extraordinary promiſe as this is. And yet it is but long life in this world, <hi>that thy days may be long in the land,</hi> &amp;c. That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is a pregnant one to this effect, Pſal. 91. <hi>ult. with long life will I ſatisfie him, and ſhew him my ſalvation.</hi> Firſt I will ſatisfie him with long life, he ſhall live ſo long on earth, till he be full of days, even as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack that is full of meat, till he deſire to live no longer, till nature be ſpun out to the uttermoſt extent, and after I will ſhew him my ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I will bring him to the place where he ſhall live for evermore.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, becauſe continuance here is properly and in it ſelf a bleſſing (as on the other ſide the contrary thereto, the rooting out of the land of the living is properly and in it ſelf a curſe) that holyeſt Saints have deprecated taking hence: They have been ſo far from praying that God would take them out of the world, that they have rather prayed againſt it; <hi>Lord take me not away in the midſt of my days,</hi> Pſal. 102.24. How did they plead ſometimes for their indangered lives, as a priſoner at the bar! and when the Lord was pleaſed to leave them in the world a little longer, they were exceedingly affected and enlarged to thankfulneſs: As <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was you know, who penned a Pſalm of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:46169:207"/>
praiſe on this occaſion, and this was the burthen of it, <hi>The living, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, they ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day.</hi>

                     </label> But you will interpoſe and ſay perhaps, <hi>Some of the choiceſt Saints of God have prayed expreſly to be taken hence, and therefore it ſhould ſeem to be the proper ſubject matter of Petition.</hi>

                     </label> 1. To this I anſwer, ſuch as prayed aright, did not make their removal hence by death the proper ſubject matter of their prayers. They did not ſeek it ſimply and abſtractly by and for it ſelf, but in relation to ſome other thing which they could not have without it. It's true indeed, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul deſired to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt;</hi> he could not be with Chriſt (he knew) unleſs he were diſſolved firſt; and therefore that he might injoy him, he was contented to be diſſolved for that end. Or otherwiſe he would have been far enough from deſiring diſſolution: And therefore in another place he ſpeaks clearly, <hi>We would not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>viz. of life and of the body,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.4. that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the thing that we deſire; <hi>But we would be clothed upon with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in heaven.</hi> If it might be poſſible, we would be clothed upon with that, without the putting off of this. Indeed he ſaith before, in the Name of all the Saints, <hi>We that are in this Tabernacle do groan, being burthened.</hi> But yet it was not life conſidered in it ſelf that was their burthen; but with its evil adjuncts and aſſociates which do continually cleave to it, and which cannot be ſevered from it in this world. So that if you take life, you muſt take that which comes with it. In this reſpect indeed, it is a burthen to the holyeſt Saints, becauſe it is accompanyed with ſuch a burthen of corruption, as makes them groan and faint under it. But if it be conſidered ſimply and abſtractly in it ſelf, it is not a burthen from which the Saints do groan to be delivered; no, it is a bleſſing rather, of which they groan to be deprived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Moſt of the Saints who have deſired God to take them hence, have failed and ſinned in thoſe deſires of theirs. It was their weakneſs and infirmity, they did it out of fear and deſpondency of Spirit, out of paſſion and impatience. And thus it ſeems <hi>Eliah</hi> did when he fled from <hi>Jezabel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.4. And thus it is extreamly probable that <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>Num.</hi> 11.10, 15. For it is ſaid <hi>he was diſpleaſed,</hi> and in that angry fit he ſaid to God, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou afflicted me? If thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of hand, and do not let me ſee my wretchedneſs.</hi> And thus it is apparent <hi>Jonas</hi> did, who being croſt in a <hi>punctilio,</hi> in a point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, out of a pettiſh, fooliſh, childiſh humour, will go die forſooth, God muſt take away his life; Theſe imperfections of the Saints are left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record in Scripture, not as marks to be aimed at, but as rocks to be declined.</p>

                     </label> Now to proceed, to make ſome Application of the point; My Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, is it ſo, that removal out of this world, is not the proper ſubject matter of Petition? Then let not any of us make it ſo, when we are put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up our ſupplications and requeſts to God. When we conſider how the world hates us, how it pours contempt upon us, how it follows us with troubles, perſecutions and afflictions; ſo that we ſee but little hope that we ſhould ever live contentedly, and quietly, and freely here;
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:46169:207"/>
it may be we are weary of it, and ever ready to deſire the Lord that he would remove us from it. To wiſh with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in a pang of diſcontent, Numb. 11.1. <hi>Would God we were dead.</hi> And with <hi>Eliah, It is enough, Lord take away our lives,</hi> 1 King. 14.4. It's that which many of us are too apt to do, when we are over-loaden with the cares and troubles of this world, to reach after deliverance, and redreſs, and eaſe by this means: And therefore when we find our hearts are running out in ſuch a way as this is, let us call them in again, let us correct our ſelves, and ſay as our Saviour in my Text, O Lord, we pray not that thou wouldſt take us out of the world, we are far from ſuch impatience, we are content to wait thy leiſure to tarry till thy time come. And here to keep you from ſuch extravagancies and irregular deſires, I ſhall preſent you with a few things.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſpecial mercy of the Lord to give us life, and to continue us in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this world, though in a comfortleſs and ſad condition. <hi>David</hi> was in a ſorry caſe, afflicted, perſecuted and oppreſſed when he put up that prayer to the Lord, <hi>Deal bountifully with thy ſervant,</hi> or <hi>be beneficial to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that I may live and keep thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.17. He counted it a benefit to live, how troubleſome ſoever his condition were. It's that which even Nature teaches us to reach after; <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi> And yet a life with nothing elſe, ſome will count worth nothing. You know my Brethren, all that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did promiſe to ſome very gratious men in times of common trouble and calamity, was only this, they ſhould have their lives for a prey, and that was all, for great things were not to be looked for, <hi>Jer.</hi> 39.38. and 45.5. And yet that was a great mercy.</p>
                  <p>If we be not taken hence, perhaps we may enjoy the mercy to out-live <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> troubles: It is mercy to live in them, but it is greater mercy to live be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them; and this if we be quiet, and content, and patient, for ought we know, may be our portion. And this was that which <hi>David</hi> promiſed to himſelf, when he was almoſt over-come and over-whelmed with his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and diſtreſſes: <hi>I ſhall not die, but live,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and declare the works of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 118.17. Me thinks he gathers up his ſpirits, when he was about to faint; why yet, ſaith he, <hi>I ſhall not dye, but live</hi> for all this, as near as I am brought; yea I ſhall live to glory and triumph in Gods works, in that which he ſhall do for me: to live in dangerous times, and to get through them, though but with an eſcape, is mercy. But to get through them with a conqueſt, is far greater mercy. To live in troubles, though in the end they overcome us, is an honor. But to live in them, ſo as in the end to overcome them; to be as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle was, in deaths often, and yet to live and to triumph, this is happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed.</p>
                  <p>Conſider, in the worſt of times, and in the midſt of greateſt troubles,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> you may be ſerviceable to the Church of Chriſt. Perhaps more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then in better times, becauſe the Church may need you more. This cauſed <hi>Paul,</hi> who elſe had certainly deſired diſſolution, to pitch upon continuance in the body; <hi>For me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to die is gain, it is beſt to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt: But to abide in the fleſh is more needful
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:46169:208"/>
for you,</hi> Phil. 1.24. And therefore that I ſhall reſolve upon, as <hi>David</hi> once, I ſhall prefer the Church before my own joy, yea, before my chief joy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And as you may be ſerviceable to the Church in the midſt of greateſt troubles; ſo you may be inſtrumental to the glory of the Lord, perhaps more inſtrumental then in better times. It was the weakneſs of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that God muſt take away his life, when by his own confeſſion, there was none almoſt to ſtand up and appear for God and for his Truth againſt the great corruptions in thoſe times, but he only: Then ſhould he have deſired to have lived, when God had greateſt need of him: It's true, that death in ſuch a caſe would be a benefit and eaſe to us; yea, but our life would be a glory to the Lord; and this we ſhould deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other. This world is the proper place where we bring glory to the Lord; in the world that is to come, we are glorified by him; Oh let us be ſo ingenuous to deſire to be a while where we may bring God glory, rather then where we may have glory from him. Let us not be ſo eager for our wages, for our reſt, till we have finiſhed our work, and ſerved our generations, and when we have done ſo, then God will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie us with himſelf for ever.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the firſt part of our Saviours Explication, in which he tells his Father plainly and expreſly, what he doth not pray for: <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldſt take them out of the world.</hi> The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, in which he tells him what he doth pray for; <hi>But that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no difficulty in the terms, requiring any tedious Explication. Some diſpute indeed there is about the meaning of the word <hi>Evil,</hi> from which our Saviour prays his Father to keep thoſe that belong to him. There want not ſome Expoſitors who underſtand this <hi>Evil</hi> here to be the world it ſelf, which indeed is <hi>very evill,</hi> which lies in wickedneſs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.19. As if our Saviour ſhould have ſaid, <hi>I pray not that thou ſhouldeſt take them out of the world, but that thou ſhouldſt keep them from the</hi> world, which is <hi>evil</hi> in it ſelf, and which will ſurely draw them into evil too, by her temptations, and her ſugred baits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou keep a watchful eye upon them, and take them into thy tuition.</p>
                  <p>Others take evil in the ordinary notion of it, and ſo it comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and involveth in it all ſin, and all affliction, according to the known diſtinction of it, into the evil of fault, and the evil of pain, whereof the latter is the fruit and iſſue of the former. So that our Saviour in their apprehenſion prays his Father, that he would keep his Apoſtles and Diſciples from all the evil in the world; For all may be reduced to theſe two heads. Not that he would remove them from it, but that he would preſerve them from the evill in it.</p>
                  <p>Others conceive the <hi>Evil</hi> mentioned in my Text, to be the Devil. For he is often called the <hi>evil one</hi> in Scripture, as you may ſee that place for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Beza</hi> is very reſolute for this interpretation: For <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as he conceives) is rather taken for a perſon then a thing: And beſides, the Article, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> which is adjoyned puts the matter out of queſtion, <hi>That

                     </gap>, that is, from the wicked one. And ſo we find the ſame expreſſion uſed by the Apoſtle, 1 Joh. 2.13. <hi>I write unto you young men, becauſe you have overcome</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>the wicked one,</hi> that is, <hi>the Devil.</hi> As for my own part, I ſee no reaſon to reject this, or either of the other Expoſitions, but to take our Saviours prayer in the largeſt and moſt comprehenſive ſenſe, which will be moſt for the ſupport and comfort of the Church. And ſo accordingly the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhall be this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> God can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, from all evil as long as they remain in this world.</head>
                  <p>Whether the evil be the evil of corruption, or the evil of affliction, the evil of ſin, or the evil of puniſhment. Whether the evil be the world; as ſome conceive, or the Devil, as others think; God can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt from all theſe in ſuch a ſenſe as I ſhall open to you by and by. Both theſe are manifeſt in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Saviours here; <hi>I pray,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou wouldſt keep them from the evil:</hi> From what evil? none is excepted, and therefore out of doubt, he means from all evil. He prays that God would ſo preſerve them, that nothing that is really and truly evil (not in it ſelf and in its nature only, but to them) nothing that is ſo to them, might come upon them. And ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt deſires it of his Father, it is very evident that he is able ſo to keep them, or elſe it were a vain Prayer; and it is as manifeſt, that he will keep them ſo, or elſe it were a fruitleſs and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual prayer. God can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt from all evil.</p>
                  <p>For clearing of the obſervation, I ſhall ſhew you particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, that God can and will preſerve them from the evil of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and from the evil of corruption, and from the evil of affliction: And if he keep from theſe, he keeps from all; from the world and Devil too, though neither of them be expreſly mentioned; for if the world, or Devil hurt us, it muſt be either by temptation or affliction.</p>
                  <p>God can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> evil of temptation. Whether you underſtand it of the temptation of the world, or the temptation of the Devil, or the temptation of our own hearts: God can and will preſerve us from it, or the evil of it, as I ſhall ſhew you evidently from the Scripture. Either he will preſerve from the aſſault, or from the prevalence, or from the hurt of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes the Lord preſerves thoſe that belong to Chriſt from the aſſault of the temptation. He doth not give the Tempter leave to tempt them: For you muſt know, my Brethren, that the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not once inject a wicked thought, or ſuggeſt a ſinful motion, without allowance granted him from God: you may behold him bound and chained, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.2. and that to this end, <hi>that he may deceive no
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:46169:209"/>
more,</hi> untill the time and ſeaſon of his chaining be expired, and after looſed at the Lords appointment. And he will looſe him only when himſelf pleaſeth. So that the Devil cannot tempt us when he will; he muſt confine himſelf within the compaſs of his chain. Indeed if God enlarge him once, he may go forth and entice us, and prevail, as you may ſee in that example, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.22. But if he limit him, he cannot move, nor meddle with us any way. <hi>This roaring Lyon walketh up and down,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. <hi>ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Not whom he will, it is not ſo, but <hi>whom he may devour.</hi> There are ſome whom he may aſſault, and others whom he may not; ſome <hi>whom he may devour,</hi> and others whom he may not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If God preſerve, not thoſe who belong to Jeſus Chriſt from the aſſault, he uſes to preſerve them from the prevalence of the temptation. Perhaps he gives the tempter power to tempt them, but then he doth not give them up into the tempters power. And then the Devil or their own corruptions may entice them long enough, before they can prevail againſt them, unleſs he give them up to Sathan, or their own luſts, unleſs he leave them, as it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the ſame caſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. You know that Sathan was permitted to ſet upon our Saviour Chriſt himſelf; but though he had obtained leave to tempt him, he had not leave to overcome him. So at his earneſt motion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a commiſſion from the Lord to worry <hi>Job.</hi> But he had only pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to tempt him; <hi>Job</hi> was not given up to his power, and therefore though he did his worſt, he could not foll him in the combate. So he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſift add winnow <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſo far forth, it ſeemeth, he obtained his deſire, that he winnowed him indeed; But though he winnowed him, he could not hurt him, becauſe he had a God to keep him, a Chriſt to intercede for him: <hi>Simon, Simon,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Satan hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired</hi> to have you, that he may <hi>winnow you as Wheat,</hi> Luke 22.31. <hi>But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not.</hi>

                  <p>We want not many ſweet and pretious promiſes to this effect diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſcattered up and down the Scripture, that God will either keep us from temptation, or if he ſuffer and permit us to be tempted, he will not give us up into the power of the temptation, but will preſerve us ſo <hi>that the very gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt us, Mat.</hi> 16.18. If Sathan or the world deſire to ſet upon us, the Lord will either ſave us and deliver us from the temptation, which he knoweth how to do, be the temptation what it will, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. or elſe he will ſupport us in it, according to his Covenant with us, for he is faithfull and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above meaſure, as the Apoſtle ſhews, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. And though he do not free us from it, yet he will uphold us in it, as he did the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. who having <hi>received a thorn in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan to buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him,</hi> and ſeeking earneſtly to God that he would free him from this troubleſome unpleaſing gueſt, although he could not be delivered from it, yet he was fortified againſt it, and had this anſwer to his prayer, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee, and my ſtrength is perfected in weakneſs.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="373" facs="tcp:46169:209"/>3. If the Lord preſerve not thoſe who belong to Jeſus Chriſt, neither from the aſſault, nor from the prevalency of the temptation: at leaſt he keeps them from the hurt of the temptation. He keeps them from the evil of it, according to our Saviours prayer in my text, <hi>I pray that thou wouldſt keep them from the evil.</hi> I muſt confeſs the holieſt Saints in caſe may not be aſſaulted only, but overcome and foiled in a temptation. <hi>David</hi> a man who hath as large a teſtimony from the Holy Ghoſt himſelf for his uprightneſs as any man almoſt in ſacred ſtory, yet he was tempted of the Devil. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. yea, and not tempted only, but ſeduced and drawn away. And that which was <hi>David,</hi> caſe, that might be the caſe of any other. But then God ſuffers it for mercifull and gratious ends which himſelf beſt knows.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps to try them, as he permitted <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to be foiled for that end; God left him to try him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. and thus he deals with many that belong to Chriſt. It may be they are apt to pleaſe themſelves with a too good opinion of their own graces, becauſe they look upon themſelves at ſuch a time when there is no temptation to diſcover what they are. And therefore God in ſuch a caſe permits them to temptation for their good, and then they ſee thoſe groſs corruptions in themſelves which they could not have imagined. <hi>Peter</hi> did little think till he was tried, he had been ſuch a Coward as he prov'd. What, that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a ſilly Maid ſhould make him flatly to deny his Lord, and Maſter, and that with oaths and execrations too! No, it is evident he thought himſelf a ſtout and valiant man, for he was reſolute that death it ſelf ſhould never work ſo far upon him: And therefore he was brought to the encounter, that he might ſee how much he was miſtaken of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and how far ſhort his real graces came of his imaginary fancies and conceits.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God ſuffers thoſe who belong to Jeſus Chriſt to be foiled in a temptation, to make them the more humble, and the more watchfull, and the more prayerfull, and ſo by conſequence the more holy, even all their lives after. And thus however the temptation doth them one way ſome hurt, yet in another way it doth them much more good, and ſo upon the whole they are better for it, not the worſe. And thus God keeps them from the evil of temptation.</p>
                  <p>And as God keeps them from the evil of temptation, ſo from the evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of corruption. Indeed he doth not keep them ſo that they have no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in them; for this is unattainable in this world; neither doth he keep them ſo, that this corruption doth not ſhew it ſelf at all in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward converſation. No, it hath both its <hi>eſſe,</hi> and its <hi>operari</hi> in the holieſt Saints. But yet he can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, either from the act and guilt or hurt of corruption that is in them. I ſhall a little touch upon them in their order.</p>
                  <p>In a qualified ſence he keeps them from the act of their corruption, ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that they act it not at all (as thus, ſometimes and in ſome certain things he keeps them and withholds them from) or not at leaſt as other men. <hi>They alſo,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of the Saints, <hi>do no iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 119.3. They ſin not ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.6. neither can they
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:46169:210"/>
ſin. Conceive it not ſo freely and ſo remorſeleſly as others; For the ſeed remaineth in them. <hi>The ſpirit luſts againſt the fleſh,</hi> ſo that they cannot do the evil that they would, at leaſt not all the evil that they would, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15. God keeps them by this means from much evil, which elſe they would fall into, as to inſtance in particulars.</p>
                  <p>He keeps them wholy from the great and unpardonable ſin, the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>There is a ſin to death,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.16. <hi>to death,</hi> not in the merit of it only, for ſo is every ſin to death, if you look to the deſert, but in the iſſue and event. And this God ſurely keeps them from, that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that they never fall into it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He keeps them uſually from the groſſer acts of ſin, which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the defilements and <hi>pollutions of the world,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. being the common mire and kennel in which the filthy Swine of this world wallow, and which are termed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, the works of the fleſh,</hi> which are manifeſt even to the the dimmeſt eye even to the light of nature it ſelf, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.19. Such are adultery, drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, perjury, theft, and ſuch like. Now from theſe foul and groſs cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which croſs the principles of common life and honeſty, in which the lewdeſt and prophaneſt wallow, God uſually keeps them that belong to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He keeps them from committing any known ſin, reſolvedly and with full conſent of will. Indeed there may be a velleity, an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and an imperfect will to ſin in thoſe that belong to Chriſt; but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect will there cannot be. For fleſh and ſpirit being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven and commixt in every faculty, and conſequently in the will, the will ſo farr as it is ſanctified and renewed, can never give allowance to the act of ſin. And whereas wicked and ungodly men are totally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and univerſaly devoted to it, they act it wholly, and with every part and power, being nothing elſe but fleſh: It is not ſo with thoſe that are renewed. And hence ſaith <hi>Paul, it is not I that do it, Rom.</hi> 7.17. yet in the verſe immediately before; he ſaid, <hi>what I would not, that do I.</hi> So that there is a double I in <hi>Paul,</hi> I ſpiritual, and I carnal; I do it and I do it not. Not I that am ſpiritual, or in that part wherein I am ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, but I that am carnal, or in that part wherein I am carnal. <hi>It is not I that do it, but the fleſh that dwelleth in me.</hi> And thus God keeps them from the acts of ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Or if he do not alwayes keep them from the acts, he alwayes frees them from the guilt of ſin; and ſo in that reſpect, he keeps them from the evil of corruption, and therefore he aſſures it to himſelf, as his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy ſin. It is God that juſtifies,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. And with relation to this act of his, he is called <hi>a deliverer,</hi> Rom. 11.26. <hi>There ſhall come out of</hi> Zion <hi>the deliverer, and he ſhall turn away ungodlineſs from</hi> Jacob. <hi>For this is my Covenant with them when I ſhall take away their ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God alwayes keeps them that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, from the hurt of the corruption that is in them; he turns their very ſins againſt their nature, by accident to their advantage; <hi>if all things,</hi> then all theſe things
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:46169:210"/>
                     <hi>work together for the beſt to them.</hi> God doth them good, even by their ſins, and by their falls: he makes that to promote and further their ſalvation, which ſeemeth moſt directly to hinder it and to oppoſe it. Oh the riches of his mercy! Bleſſings and Ordinances, by accident, do hurt to wicked men; And even ſins by accident do good to Gods people.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſhewed you, that God can and will preſerve thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, from the evil of temptation and corruption.</p>
                  <p>And as God keeps thoſe that belong to Jeſus Chriſt from the evil <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of temptation, and from the evil of corruption, ſo from the evil of affliction; I muſt confeſs he doth not keep them ſo that they are utterly exempt from all affliction. They have their ſhare and portion of it many times, as well as any other men. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. not of the wicked only, but the righteous too. Yea their afflictions oftentimes are more and greater then the afflictions of the wicked are. The Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was too ſenſible of this, ſo that <hi>his ſpirit fretted at it,</hi> and he was <hi>envious at the fooliſh,</hi> as himſelf confeſſeth, Pſal. 73.3. <hi>when he ſaw the proſperity of wicked men. Their ſtrength is firm,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there are no bands in their death. They are not in trouble like other men, nor are they plagued like other men,</hi> no nor like better men; <hi>Their eyes ſtand out with fatneſs, they have more then heart can wiſh: Theſe are the wicked,</hi> ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, <hi>they proſper in the world.</hi> But how fares it with <hi>David</hi> all this while? why verily, ſaith he, <hi>I have cleanſed my heart in vain, and waſhed my bands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued and chaſtned every morning.</hi> And this is that which Chriſt forewarned his Diſciples of, that in the world they muſt have troubles, there would be no avoiding of it. But yet however, God keeps them from the evil of affliction in the ſence that I ſhall open to you, in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes when he ſees it beſt, he keeps them from affliction, that it doth not touch them for a conſiderable time together. He environs them with loving kindneſs round about, ſo that no trouble or calamity can find a way to enter and to ſeize upon them, according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſe, Pſal. 5. ult. <hi>For thou Lord wilt bleſs the righteous, with favour wilt thou compaſs him as with a ſhield.</hi> And thus he dealt a while with <hi>Job,</hi> as Satan enviouſly ſuggeſted to the Lord, <hi>Job</hi> 1.10. <hi>Haſt thou not made a hedge about him, and about all that he hath on every ſide? thou haſt bleſſed the work of his hands, and his ſubſtance is increaſed in the Land.</hi> So <hi>David,</hi> though he were a man of many troubles and afflictions, yet he had his Halcyon dayes. There was a time when God had made his Mountain of proſperity ſo ſtrong that he was verily perſwaded he ſhould never be removed. And there are many promiſes of ſpecial preſervation from dangers and diſtreſſes made to thoſe who have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God and Chriſt. I might heap up a multitude of ſuch; but there is one Pſalm of <hi>David</hi> that ſeems to be a ſhort <hi>Compendium</hi> and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them all, <hi>viz.</hi> Pſal. 91. <hi>He ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler, and from the noiſome Peſtilence. He ſhall cover thee with his feathers,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46169:211"/>
his truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler: thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terrour by night, nor for the arrow that flyeth by day, nor for the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, nor the deſtruction that waſteth at noon-day. A thouſand ſhall fall at thy ſide and ten thouſand on thy right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes ſhalt thou behold it.</hi> Thou ſhalt ſee it ſeize on others, but for thy own part thou ſhalt be exempt from it. <hi>There ſhall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling; For he ſhall give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee.</hi> Now theſe and ſuch like promiſes the Lord makes good to his, even in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry letter of them, when in the infiniteneſs of his love and wiſdom he ſees it moſt expedient for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or if God do not keep them from affliction that it doth not touch them, he keeps them that it doth not ſtay too long with them. The rod of trouble though it ſtrike them, yet it doth not reſt upon them. It is on and off again in due time. Its true God often ſuffers thoſe who belong to Jeſus Chriſt to be brought into affliction, but then he doth not leave them there, his manner is to bring them out again. To deliver them from evil, according to that paſſage in the Lords prayer. And therefore he is ſtiled the deliverer of his people, and the God of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>He that is our God, is the God of ſalvation, and to the Lord God belong the iſſues from death,</hi> not from inferiour dangers only, but from death it ſelf. And hence ſalvation is aſcribed to him as his peculiar: <hi>It is of the Lord,</hi> ſath <hi>Jonah,</hi> Chap. 2.9. <hi>Salvation belongeth to the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 3.8. <hi>and his bleſsing upon his people.</hi> It is his work to ſave us from diſtreſſes and afflictions; the ſecondary means are ſubordinate to him, they move but as he acts them. And this is very uſual with him; if he prevent not the afflictions of his people that they do not come upon them, yet he delivers them at length from thoſe afflictions, aſſoon as they have done their work in them, yea, let them be as many as they will, Pſal. 34.19. <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivereth them out of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Or if God do not keep them who belong to Jeſus Chriſt from the evil of affliction, by way of preſervation, or deliverance from it, he keeps them many times by way of preſervation and delivery in it. So that though it ſeize upon them, it is no pain or trouble to them. And thus he kept the three Confeſſors, he did not ſave them from the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, but he ſaved them in the furnace, Dan. 3.27. <hi>The fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was a hair of their head ſinged, neither were their Coats changed, nor the ſmell of fire did paſs upon them.</hi> According to that pretious promiſe, Iſa. 43.2. <hi>when thou paſſeſt through the waters I will be with thee, and through the rivers, they ſhall not overwhelm thee, when thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burned, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if not thus, he qualifies his people ſo with inward peace, and comfort, and aſſurance, that they feel not what they feel. They are ſo raviſhed and tranſported to an extaſie of holy joy, that they are in a ſort inſenſible even of the greateſt torment that humane cruelty can deviſe to inflict. <hi>Unto the righteous,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>ariſeth light in darkneſs,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:46169:211"/>
glorious comfort even in the midſt of greateſt troubles,</hi> Pſal. 112.4. <hi>Thy light ſhall riſe in obſcurity,</hi> ſaith God, Iſa. 58.10. <hi>And thy darkneſs ſhall be as the noon-day;</hi> Such light did there ariſe to ſome of the bleſſed Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, when it was darkeſt with them, in regard of outward comforts, ſo that they ſung in the priſons, in the irons, in the flames; they were not able to contain themſelves, by reaſon of the ſodain flaſh of joy that came breaking in upon them, which made them to forget the miſeries and torments which they ſuffered; yea, though the fire did kindle on them, and conſume them into aſhes: yet many of them warbled out me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious accents in the flames, profeſſed that they were amidſt the fire as in a bed of down and ſpices, where they felt nothing elſe but admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joy and comfort. Theſe men you ſee did more then conquer, they did triumph in the very midſt of their unparalleld and matchleſs ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: ſo that they might have taken up that comfortable ſpeech of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.37. <hi>In all theſe things we are more then Conquerors.</hi> And what were thoſe things? ſee at the 35. verſe, <hi>In tribulation, and diſtreſs, and perſecution, and famine, and nakedneſs, and peril and ſword:</hi> then which there are no greater outward evils in the world: <hi>In all theſe things we are more then Conquerors through him that loved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Or if God do not keep his people from the ſmart, at leaſt he keeps them from the hurt of their afflictions. The world indeed may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them, and that to the very death; they may take away their names, their eſtates, their lives from them; but though they kill them, they can never hurt them. God keeps them from the evil of all this, <hi>from the evil</hi> in the world, as you have it in my Text; what ever comes upon them, they are no loſers in the main, but gainers rather. <hi>All things are for their ſakes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. for their profit and advantage; <hi>Yea, though the outward man periſh,</hi> by reaſon of the length or violence of the affliction, <hi>the inward man is renewed day by day. Their afflictions work out for them a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> They may ſuffer grievouſly, their ſufferings may deprive them of the life of nature, but they cannot deprive them of the life of grace, or glory: They may be perſecuted, but they cannot be forſaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and finally; they may be caſt down, but they cannot be deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. They may be deſtroyd as men; but they can never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyd as Saints: In this reſpect they are like Mount Sion that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be removed: <hi>The rain deſcended,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and the floods came, and the wind blew and beat upon the houſe, and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock,</hi> Mat. 7.25. <hi>q.d.</hi> Nothing can hurt or overthrow him that is built on Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhall ſtand faſt for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
                  <p>Nay to go a little further, God doth not only keep them that belong to Jeſus Chriſt from the hurt of their afflictions, but more then ſo, he doth them much good by them; that they may ſay as <hi>David</hi> doth when all is ended, <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted.</hi> I give you but a taſte of this, and I have done with Explication.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes he awakens them by their afflictions; they are ſleepy and ſecure, and God jogges and ſtartles them, and rouzes them by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:46169:212"/>
this means; <hi>When men are bound in fetters,</hi> ſaith <hi>Elihu, and held faſt in the cords of their afflictions, ſo that they are not able to unloooſe themſelves and get away:</hi> what then? why <hi>then he ſheweth them their works, and their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that they have exceeded in: q.d.</hi> At ſuch a time his manner is to repreſent their ſins to them, with all their circumſtantial aggravations: See an example of it in the Lords own people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21. when <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren ſaw themſelves taken for ſpies in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo in preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their lives, the ſin they had committed many years ago, came as freſh into their minds, and lay as heavy on their Conſciences, as if it had been newly done. I know that troubles and diſtreſſes, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of death it ſelf, hath not always this effect on all men; the Lord hath poured on ſome the ſpirit of ſlumber: but uſually they have on Gods people.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes God abates their pride by their afflictions: There is not any ſin that makes a man more odious to the Lord then pride doth, or is a greater bar to his ſalvation; <hi>All that are proud in heart are an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to him,</hi> Prov. 16.5. neither is there are any man but hath ſome reliques of this leaven in him, which puffeth up his heart, and makes him ſwell beyond meaſure: Yea, the choiceſt of the Saints, have mighty inclinations to it, eſpecially if all things go on their ſide. As it is ſaid of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he was put into a proſperous eſtate, his heart was lifted up, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.25. and therefore God expoſes them to ſharp afflictions, that he may hide the pride of man, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Joh</hi> 33.17. that he may leſſen and abate, and wear it out, till it be not to be ſeen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sometimes God draws his people nearer to himſelf by their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. <hi>In their affliction they will ſeek me early,</hi> ſaith the Lord of his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. It ſeems they had been wofully regardleſs of the Lord in former times of happineſs, and peace, and comfort; but ſaith the Lord, <hi>In their affliction they will haſten to me,</hi> they will be eager after me, and never reſt till they have found me: And this you ſhall obſerve to be the diſpoſition of the ſons men; yea of the beſt and holyeſt of them; they look not after God ſo much at any time, as when they are in greateſt exigencies and diſtreſſes. And as the ſails, though they be ſome addition to the burthen of the ſhip, yet they help it on the faſter to the Haven: So croſſes and afflictions, though they be a burthen to us, yet they haſten us to God, and draw us on the faſter to the port of happineſs: And therefore God relating divers judgements which he was reſolved to bring upon his own people, by which he meant to ſtrip them naked of all outward comforts, at length concludes that this ſhould be the iſſue of it, Iſa. 17.7. <hi>At that day ſhall they look unto their Maker, and their eyes ſhall have reſpect unto the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a miſerable thing, yet ſo it is, as long as we have any thing on earth to reſt upon, we enquire not after God: With <hi>Noahs</hi> Dove, if we can find a twig to pitch upon, we are regardleſs of the Ark; and therefore God by heavy croſſes and afflictions ſtrips us of theſe outward helps, and ſtrikes away the earthly things by which we ſtand, and when we know not what to do; when we are driven out of all our
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:46169:212"/>
holes, then our eyes are upon God; when we look on every hand, and refuge fails us every way, and no man careth for our ſouls, then we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves to God, and ſay to him, <hi>Thou art our refuge,</hi> Pſal. 142.4. It ſeems that <hi>David,</hi> though he were a holy man, was very apt, while he was furniſhed with theſe outward favors, to rely too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſo far as to neglect the Lord. But when the Lord by croſſes and afflictions took them from him, or made him ſee the vanity and inſufficiency of them, then he cryed out, <hi>And now Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee;</hi> now I have tryed how fickle, and how vain the creature is; now I perceive by ſenſible experience, that no help is in it; <hi>Now Lord what wait I for?</hi> &amp;c. And thus I think I have ſufficiently cleared the point; God can and will preſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </label> This ſerves to let us ſee the admirable and tranſcendent happineſs of all that have an intereſt in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, in this reſpect that they are ſafe from all evil. <hi>God will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold no good from them,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks; and then upon the other ſide, he will keep all evil from them, as you have it in my Text. Beloved, we are here in an uncomfortable place, a wicked world, in which we are expoſed (as conſidered in our ſelves) to all evil. We are exempt from no temptation; No not the blackeſt and the bloodleſt, to the very worſt of ſins. We are ſecure from no affliction, no not the ſharpeſt and the moſt extream. If there be any worſe then other, which we conceive would be moſt bitter and intolerable to us, it is going in the world, and it may ſeiſe on us as well as others: Yea, we are always bearing with us in our boſoms, that which is infinitely worſe then both the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the evil of corruption: ſo that we ſeem to be in a very ſad condition. But yet this comfort waits upon us ſtill, the Lord will ſurely keep us abſolutely free from the evil of them all. The worſt of them may do us good, but it ſhall never do us hurt, as long as there is any vertue in our Saviours Interceſſion, as long as he hath any intereſt in God the Father.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when we look upon the world, and ſee it marching out againſt us with bloody perſecutions and afflictions; when we look upon the Devil, and ſee him ready to aſſault us with his fiery darts, and fierce tentations; when we look inward to our own hearts, and ſee ſuch ſwarms of helliſh luſts and baſe corruptions there, and are ready to cry out in the anguiſh of our ſouls, <hi>Oh miſerable men that we are, who ſhall deliver us!</hi> let us look up to Jeſus Chriſt, and think upon his powerful Interceſſion with the Father, that he hath prayed him to preſerve and keep us from all the evil in the world, and ſo let us be quiet and ſecure: Let us ſay as <hi>David</hi> once, <hi>Though I walk in the valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> among men, among Devils, among temptations, and corruptions, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of all ſorts, of all ſizes, <hi>yet I will not be afraid;</hi> for Chriſt hath interceded for me to the Father, and he will certainly preſerve me from the hurt of all theſe; He will keep me from every evil work, and preſerve me to his heavenly Kingdom.</p>

               <p>AND thus far of the Second Argument with which our Saviour preſſeth and enforceth his Petition to his Father, together with the Explication of it. To this he adds a repetition of that which he delivered word for word before, as you ſhall ſee if you compare them both together. <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> He ſaid before, <hi>I have given them thy Word, and the world hath hated them, becauſe they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> And here again, <hi>they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee my Brethren, Repetition of the ſelf ſame thing, and in the ſelf ſame words in Prayer, is not to be condemned in all caſes. Our Saviour as he is our Mediator to pray for us, ſo he is our Maſter too, to inſtruct us how to pray; <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſay the Diſciples to our Saviour, Luk. 11.1. <hi>teach us to pray as</hi> John <hi>alſo taught his Diſciples.</hi> And he teaches us to pray not by his precept only, but by example too. And in the latter way he teaches us in this place, to fetch over things again that have been ſaid before in prayer, yea, ſometimes in the very ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. And in another place the Holy Ghoſt obſerveth of him, that he prayed a ſecond and a third time, ſaying the very ſame words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.44. He could have varied, but he would not varie, becauſe his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and affection led him into the very ſame tract wherein he had gone once or twice before. And ſo when repetitions are not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, but out of choiſe, becauſe the zeal and fervor of the ſpeaker draws him and invites him to it, they are ſometimes of very good uſe. Indeed our Saviour, I acknowledge, interdicteth repetitions: but mark, what repetitions my Beloved; Battologies, vain repetitions: <hi>When ye pray,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>uſe no vain repetitions, as the Heathens do,</hi> and as the Papiſts do, who uſe to babble over ſo many <hi>Pater Noſters,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> and think to be heard for their much ſpeaking, as it is added there in that place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.7. Obſerve it well; our Saviour ſaith not, uſe no repetitions; <hi>but uſe no vain repetitions.</hi> And when they flow from the ſtrength of the affection, that knows not which way to get off from ſome conſiderable and important thing, as you may note in <hi>David,</hi> and other Saints in Scripture, they are not vain, but to very good purpoſe.</p>
               <p>What was our Saviours purpoſe in the repetition that he uſes in my Text, is diverſly conceived by thoſe that write upon it. Once this is evident to me, there is the ſame occaſion for the repetition, that there was for the mention of the ſelf-ſame thing before. Before, the hatred to which they were expoſed in the world, and here the evil which they were like to ſuffer from the world, of both which this was the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe indeed they were not of this world but of another. There, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>the world hath hated them;</hi> how ſo? <hi>They are not of the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:46169:213"/>
world, even as I am not of this world.</hi> Here ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I pray thee Father, keep them from the evil of the world.</hi> Why, are they like to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer evil from the world? how ſo? The ſame again, <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> And he would have it to be very well obſerved, that all the hatred and injurious dealing, to which his poor Diſciples were expoſed in the world, proceeded not from any fault of theirs, but it was meerly upon this account, becauſe they were not of the world, but were conformable to Chriſt himſelf in this particular: The world likes them much the worſe, becauſe they were in this reſpect like Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now inſiſt upon the words as conſidered in dependence, and as they are a reaſon of the evil uſage which Chriſts Diſciples uſe to meet withal in this world; For this I did when I laſt met with them; But I ſhall take them abſolutely as conſidered in themſelves: And ſo they yield us out this general Obſervation.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE</hi> That Chriſts Diſciples are in this reſpect like Chriſt himſelf, that they are of another world as he is.</head>
                  <p>There are two things in the point, which I ſhall clear diſtinctly and in order: Firſt Chriſt himſelf is not of this world, but of another. Then Chriſts Diſciples are in this reſpect like him. They are like him many ways, in many things, and eſpecially in this among the reſt, <hi>That they are not of the world, as he is not of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, That Chriſt himſelf is not of this world,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but of another, you ſee it is his own expreſs aſſertion in my Text, <hi>I am not of this world:</hi> He doth not ſay, I am not in this world; for that indeed he could not ſay when he made this prayer; Nay, he ſaith the contrary but a verſe or two before, <hi>Theſe things ſpeak I in the world. But I am not of this world,</hi> this he affirmeth here, and in divers others places: Though he were really a man, yet he was not like other men, at leaſt not like worldly men in this regard, as he told the Phariſees, Joh. 8.23. <hi>Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to open this a little, I ſhall ſhew you particularly and diſtinctly that Jeſus Chriſt when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world, but of another, eſpecially in theſe reſpects. As firſt becauſe he came from another world. And ſecondly, becauſe he lived in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world. And thirdly, becauſe he went to another world; I ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe in order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Jeſus Chriſt when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world, but of another, becauſe he came from another world: And he was more properly of the world he came from, then of the world he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in for a little ſpace only. And thus he argues with the Jews, in the fore-alleadged Scripture, Joh. 8.23. <hi>Ye are from beneath, I am from above,</hi> ſaith he. And what doth he infer upon it? <hi>Ye are of this world, I am not of this world.</hi> You ſee both the clauſes anſwer one another; <hi>Ye
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:46169:214"/>
are from beneath, and</hi> therefore <hi>ye are of this world. I am from above, and</hi> therefore <hi>I am not of this world;</hi> In this reſpect he is called <hi>the Lord from heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47. Obſerve it, not the Lord in heaven, <hi>but the Lord from heaven:</hi> and that not only with relation to his ſecond, but alſo to his firſt coming; <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven,</hi> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, Joh. 3.13. <hi>but he that came down from heaven.</hi> So that when he was incarnate, he came down from heaven in a ſenſe; for of this our Saviour ſpeaks in that place: And to this ſpeech of Chriſt it is that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alludeth, when ſpeaking of our Saviour Chriſts aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. he addeth preſently by way of Explication, <hi>Now that he aſcended, what is it but that he alſo firſt deſcended into the lower parts of the earth?</hi> So then, deſcend he did at firſt from heaven, as after he aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up again to heaven. And becauſe he came from heaven, he is more properly of heaven, then of earth; as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates very clearly, when he calls him <hi>the Lord from heaven,</hi> heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47, 48. Becauſe from heaven, therefore heavenly, <hi>not of this world, but of another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world, but of another, becauſe he lived in another; Here he breathed, but there he lived; he did not live the life of this world, but the life of heaven; and that not in expectation, as we do, but in fruition; He lived the life of perfect righteouſneſs and perfect holineſs, the life of Angels; yea, a life above Angels while he was here in this world: That life which is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by us, nowhere but in heaven only, Chriſt lived here in this world; and this perhaps was partly aimed at by our Saviour in that ſpeech of his, Joh. 3.13. <hi>No man hath aſcended up to heaven, but he that came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, even the Son of man which is in heaven:</hi> He was then come down from heaven, he was then upon the earth when he ſpake theſe words. And yet he addeth, he was then in heaven too, even the Son of man which is in heaven. And he was then in heaven, not only as the Son of God, but as the Son of man too. Virtually he was there, though he were not locally: His life did reliſh infinitely more of heaven then of earth.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it is very notable that he diſclaimed all medling with theſe earthly things; he would not once ſo much as touch with them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a Judge or a divider, as himſelf profeſſeth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.14. nor as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor neither. It's true, he was a King, as he implicitely acknowledges to <hi>Pilate;</hi> and he had a kind of Kingdom while he was here in this world, but it was not of this world; <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.36. And therefore he did nor erect it outwardly, with any outward policy and ſplendour among men, but he did only ſet it up in the hearts of a few deſpiſed people, to whom he ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is within you;</hi> Luk. 17.21. And ſo in every thing, my Brethren, he avoided ſuch a converſation as might intimate him to be one of this world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt when he was here in this world, yet he was not of this world, but of another, becauſe indeed he was but going to another world; From another world he came, as you have heard before, and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:46169:214"/>
to another world he was about to go. Only he tarried here a little, about ſome weighty and important buſineſs which his Father ſent him down into this lower world to do, and as ſoon as that was ended, he returned to heaven again. So that you ſee, brethren, he converſed here but as a Meſſenger from God the Father, whoſe errand he came down upon, and to whom he was to go, aſſoon as he had finiſhed what he came for. And therefore he avoided any kind of ſetlement in this world, any way of making this his fixed habitation, as he told the Scribe that was about to follow him, Mat. 8.20. <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</hi> Yea, he profeſſed that he was not in the world, while he was here, becauſe indeed he was not to continue here; he was ſhortly to depart, he was as good as gone already, as in this Chapter I am handling, ver. 11. <hi>And now I am no more in the world, but I come to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e.</hi> And this for cleering of the former member of the point, that Chriſt himſelf is not of this world, but of another.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond branch, that Chriſts Diſciples are in this reſpect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> like Chriſt himſelf, this lies before you in the letter of the text, <hi>They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</hi> And this our Saviour often minds them of, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, to name no more at this time, John 15.19. <hi>Ye are not of the world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but I have choſen you out of the world.</hi> Indeed, as Chriſt is, ſo they are in this world, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7. So in this world, that they are not of the world. And that in all the three reſpects wherein we have clearly ſhewed you that Chriſt is not of this world, but of another.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts Diſciples came from another world, and ſo in that reſpect they are not of the world, as Chriſt is not of the world. I ſay they came originally from another world, although not as they are men, yet as they are Saints and Chriſtians: So they are from above of God, they are his off-ſpring, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Athenians, <hi>God is their Father, for they are begotten of him,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. And God is their Mother too, for they are born of him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9. So that you ſee, they are no leſs then a divine and heavenly generation. And they are <hi>members of the New Jeruſalem,</hi> which <hi>John ſaw coming down from heaven,</hi> Apoc. 21.2. They are only for a while let down from heaven in a ſheet, as the creatures were to <hi>Peter</hi> in a viſion, and ſo taken up again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Chriſts Diſciples came from another world, ſo they live in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and ſo in that reſpect they are not of the world, as Chriſt is not of the world; <hi>Their Converſation is in heaven,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. With the woman, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12. they tread the <hi>Moon,</hi> this variable and <hi>unconſtant</hi> world under their feet. Trample with a diſdainfull and a holy ſcorn upon earth and earthly things. Honors are too ignoble to command them, riches too poor to buy them, pleaſures too fleeting to allure them. Sometimes they are tranſported (as it were) rapt and taken up into heaven in ſweet Soliloquies, and in holy contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations, raviſhed beyond themſelves with cleer and comfortable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of their Fathers love. Indeed they get above the world, they ſoare higher then the earth, <hi>their treaſure is in heaven, and there are
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:46169:215"/>
their hearts alſo:</hi> Their life is Angel-like: <hi>they live with men indeed, but walk with God,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Enoch. They have their eyes on him</hi> (as Moſes) <hi>they ſee him who is inviſible,</hi> and they are taken up with him in all their wayes and actions. They are acquainted very well with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, (to uſe the phraſe of holy <hi>Job</hi>) they converſe with God here, come very often to his houſe, now and then ſup with him, ſpeak with him twice a day at leaſt, and that in a familiar way, untill at length they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a more neer and intimate enjoyment of the Lord for ever, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. till they be caught up (as they were firſt let down,) to meet him, and ſo <hi>to be for ever with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſts Diſciples are going to another world, and ſo in that reſpect they are not of the world, as Chriſt is not of the world, becauſe the world is not their fixed habitation; It is the character of wicked wretches, that they are men of this world, and that <hi>they have their portion here,</hi> Pſal. 17.14. In which reſpect the Prophet ſets them in oppoſition to the Saints. And ſo ungodly men are ſtiled <hi>the inhabitants and the indwellers of the earth,</hi> very often in the Book of Revelation. But now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian on the other ſide, is not a dweller but a ſtranger on the earth. And this the Saints of God have frequently profeſſed in the Scriptures. The Fathers, they acknowledged (as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerveth, Heb. 11.13.) <hi>that they were forreigners and pilgrims here.</hi> And <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle notes, <hi>ſojourned in the Land of promiſe.</hi> Obſerve it well, he did not dwell there, <hi>but ſojourned as in a ſtrange Countrey,</hi> Heb. 11.9. And why? becauſe he looked for a City where he meant to dwell: he had it not, but he expected it and looked for it. And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth in the name of all the faithfull, that they had no continuing City here (no City that they meant to ſettle in) but they ſought for one to come. This was the City that the Fathers ſaw a great way of, and made towards. And ſo deſpiſing all the happineſs and glory of the preſent world, where they were ſtrangers, and in which they were tarrying only for a little ſpace, they ſet their eyes and hearts on this which was their own Countrey, Heb. 11.19. <hi>They deſired a better Countrey which was an heavenly, where God had prepared for them a City.</hi> And the ſame diſpoſition you may note in others of the faithfull mentioned there in that Chapter.</p>

Then let us prove our ſelves by this my brethren, whither we be Chriſts Diſciples, yea or no. If we be the indwellers of the earth, if we be at home here, if we have our portion here, no portion in the other world, we are none of Chriſts Diſciples. No, no; if we belong to him we are ſtrangers in the earth, we are abſent from our home while we are here; <hi>we are not of the world as Chriſt is not of the world;</hi> and whether we be ſo or no, we may diſcover by theſe evidences following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They that are not of this world, are not in all reſpects conformed to it; <hi>they faſhion not themſelves according to the world,</hi> Rom. 12.2. <hi>they walk not according to the courſe of this world,</hi> Epheſ. 2.2. As Turks and Spaniards are not like to Engliſhmen, they have another kind of viſage,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:46169:215"/>
another garb and habit, and the like: So they that are not of this world differ manifeſtly from it. There is a clear diſtinction to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and worldly men, by any man that marks them well, and hath his Judgement exerciſed to diſcern. There are none like them in the earth; their wayes are of another faſhion then the wayes of other men. Now I beſeech you, my beloved, think upon it; If you be faſhioned to this world, if you be carried with a ſwinge of the prophane and vitious times and places where you live, if you run down the ſtream with others, if you ſleep as others do, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.6. if you ſwear as others do, if you run out with others to the ſame exceſs of riot, you are ſurely of this world, and not the other.</p>
                  <p>They that are not of this world, but of the other, have a very dear <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> affection to thoſe of the other world. If travellers and ſtrangers meet with any of their Countreymen in a remote and forreign Land; how lovingly do they embrace them? What kindneſs do they ſhew them? how are they knit together in a bond of love? Juſt ſo it is with Chriſts Diſciples; if at any time they light on thoſe who are not of this world, but of the other as themſelves are, they are taken up with joy, and preſently their hearts and their affections, by a kind of ſympathie do wonderfully cloſe together. And therefore thoſe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers deal too groſly to deceive (<hi>ſi tamen Hypocriſis dici debeat, quae jam latere prae abundantia non poteſt, prae impudentia non quaerit,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks) who would be taken to be Chriſts Diſciples, while their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and their boſome friends are the men of this world; yea Traytors to the place to which they would be thought to appertain. And others hate the very men whom Chriſt hath called out of the world: holineſs whereever they find it being the object of their fury. Suppoſe thou wert in <hi>Italy,</hi> or in another forreign land, and there ſhouldſt meet an Engliſhman, wouldſt thou mock and ſcoff at him? wouldſt thou deride and jear the faſhion of his Hat, and Cloak, and Sute, the manner of his Complement, his Gate, and Carriage, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> wouldſt thou procure him to be taken up, impriſoned, put to death? Thy earthly Countrey would not own thee, if thou ſhouldſt be ſo unworthy: and truly Heaven will not own the men who deal thus baſely and injuriouſly with the inhabitants of that Countrey.</p>
                  <p>They that are not of this world, their language is not of this world but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the other: they ſpeak the tongue of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> their ſpeech is gratious, and uſually <hi>to glorifie their God, or to edifie their brethren;</hi> But they that are of this world, they ſpeak of this world, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.5. <hi>Shibboleth</hi> never diſcried ſo many Ephramites as this doth worldly men. Of what place are they inhabitants whoſe language is ſo harſh and tart, <hi>whoſe mouths are full of curſings and bitterneſs, the poyſon of Aſpes being under their lips?</hi> Where dwell they (Alas too neer us) who cannot ſpeak almoſt without an oath, whoſe tongues are alwayes dipping in that blood which was ſhed for mans ſalvation? Are they inhabitants of the Celeſtial <hi>Canaan,</hi> whoſe tongues are keen as ſwords, and ſharp as Arrows, to hew and wound their brethrens names? Shall I ſay that man or woman is of heaven, whoſe tongue is ſet on fire of hell?
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:46169:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
To what place do they appertain, <hi>whoſe ſpeech is ſtuft with filthineſs and ribauldry, whoſe words are rotten?</hi> as the Apoſtles ſpeaks. Brethren, do not deceive your ſelves; if you cannot ſpeak the language, you belong not to the Countrey.</p>

                  <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched the firſt part of our Saviours prayer, in behalf of his Apoſtles and Diſciples who were then about him, and in it the firſt main thing which he deſireth for them, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond follows now in order to be entred on, and here the main thing, that he ſeeks in their behalf, is Sanctification. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall diſtinctly cleer theſe two things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, that the word of God is the ordinary Means by which he ſanctifies his people in a way of inchoation, by which he begins that work in them, by which he converteth them, regenerates them and makes them to become new creatures. And this we find abundantly exemplified in the times of the Apoſtle, how mightily the word of God prevailed to the Converſion of their hearers, and to the working of unfeigned faith, and grace in them. You may behold three thouſand ſinners wrought upon by one Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. And yet again, as if theſe had been a few, five thouſand by another Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4. And hence it is my brethren, that the word is called the word of grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it works grace in Gods people. But whether this be the work of the Law, or of the Goſpel, whether one or both of them be the ordinary means by which God ſanctifies his people, will need to be a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opened and reſolved. And I ſhall ſhew you from the Scripture, that both of them are inſtruments in Gods hand, by which he ſanctifies his people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God ſanctifies his people preparatively by the Law. The Law
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:46169:217"/>
converts, and worketh grace by way of preparation. It ſhews a man his ſin and his trangreſſion, it emptieth him of all opinion of himſelf, it humbles him, and layes him low in apprehenſion of his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs: And ſo indeed, it makes him fit to entertain the grace of God; <hi>for he will give his grace unto the humble. John Baptiſts</hi> rough and rigid preaching of the Law you know, my brethren, muſt prepare the way for Chriſt. He muſt be like a Pioner to go before him, to bring down every high exalted thought, to make the Mountains levell with the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes; He muſt be like a Harbinger to ride before, and take up room for Jeſus Chriſt, to write his name upon the heart, This heart is taken up for Chriſt; To cauſe theſe everlaſting doors to be ſet open to him when he comes. And when the heart is thus prepared, thus emptied, and thus opened once, then it is fit for Jeſus Chriſt with all the graces of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to enter in and dwell there. And this is all that God doth by the Law, he ſanctifieth men by way of preparation and prediſpoſition only; But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The means by which he ſanctifieth them indeed, and works the truth and the reality of ſaving grace in them, is the preaching of the Goſpel; and therefore the Apoſtle puts the queſtion to the renewed <hi>Galathians,</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>This only would I learn of you,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>received ye the ſpirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of faith? q. d.</hi> for this I appeal to you, I put the matter to your conſciences, whether the ſaving graces of the ſpirit, were not firſt wrote in you by the hearing of faith: that is, by hearing the doctrine of faith, which is the Goſpel. And hence the Goſpel is ſometimes called <hi>the grace of God,</hi> as you may ſee that place for inſtance, <hi>Titus</hi> 2.11. and that not <hi>formaliter,</hi> for ſo the Goſpel is not, neither can it be the grace of God (neither that grace which is in God; I mean his free and undeſerved favour; nor yet that grace which is communicated and diſpenſed from him to us; I mean the gifts of his ſpirit, whether they be ſuch as appertain to edification, or ſanctification,) but <hi>effective,</hi> as the School-men ſpeak, the Goſpel is the grace of God, becauſe the grace of God is the effect and iſſue of the Goſpel. The Goſpel is the inſtrumental means of grace and holineſs which it effecteth under God, and worketh in the hearts of his people. And under this expreſſion it is ſet in oppoſition to the Law. For as the Law doth not reveal the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Redeemer as the Goſpel doth: ſo neither doth it work the grace of God, I mean the ſaving gifts of his ſpirit: and therefore it is called the Miniſtration of the Letter, and not the Miniſtration of the Spirit, becauſe there goes no ſpirit with it. Or if it carry any of the ſpirit with it, it is the ſpirit of fear and bondage, and legal humiliation, and not the ſpirit of adoption and ſanctification. But on the other ſide, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel carries ſpirit in the miniſtration of it, which it conveyes into the heart of thoſe that hear it and embrace it, as they ought to do. It operateth and begetteth the endowments of the ſpirit, and worketh grace and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
                  <p>And as the word of God is the ordinary means by which he begins <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the work of Sanctification: So it is the means alſo by which he carries on the ſame work to further meaſures and degrees. They were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

already for whom our Saviour makes this prayer in my text; the work was begun in them, they were his own Apoſtles and Diſciples; and yet for them he prays, <hi>ſanctifie them with thy Truth, q. d.</hi> Sanctifie them yet more fully, make them yet more gratious and more humble, and more holy, by a more full diſcovery of the Truth revealed in thy Word to them: <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> Indeed the Word, my Brethren, as it is incorruptible ſeed, by which men are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and born again to God, as the Apoſtle ſhews, 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible, but incorruptible ſeed, by the Word of God:</hi> ſo it is milk which nouriſhes and makes them thrive and grow, while they are but babes in Chriſt: and it is alſo ſtrong meat on which they feed, <hi>until they come</hi> ad <gap reason="foreign">

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, the fruit of their endeavours who faithfully diſpenſe the Word of God, is not always manifeſt. <hi>Eliah</hi> thought he had been left alone, and yet even then <hi>there were ſeven thouſand men that had not bowed the knee to Baal:</hi> Among the Rulers there were ſome who were indeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and believed in Chriſt; and yet becauſe they were but novices, and newly entred, they were fearful to acknowledge and confeſs him; Grace is not always wrought with obſervation, as our Saviour ſheweth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.13. It is compared to <hi>Seed</hi> in Scripture, <hi>which after it is ſowen, lies hid and covered in the earth a while, and is not ſeen.</hi> And therefore faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teachers ſhould not be diſheartned becauſe they cannot ſee the fruit of their indeavours; it may be they have ſowen the ſeed, that may ſpring up and flouriſh in another age. And they have laid the good foundation under ground, and out of ſight, on which another faithful Miniſter may build, and raiſe a very goodly frame. And herein is that ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times verified; (to uſe our Saviours own word) Joh. 4.37. <hi>One ſoweth and another reapeth:</hi> The Prophets laboured, and the Apoſtles entred on their labours; and ſo it is at this day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:46169:218"/>Though their labour be in vain, reſpectively to their deſired iſſue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſucceſs, the converſion of their people, they ought not to deſiſt from it; No, they muſt work the work of God, they muſt continue preaching ſtill, though no fruit at all ſhould follow: <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> ſaith the Lord unto <hi>EZekiel,</hi> chap. 2.7. <hi>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are a rebellious houſe;</hi> And the Apoſtles exhortation is very appoſite to this purpoſe, 2 Tim. 4.4. <hi>They ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables.</hi> What now, muſt <hi>Timothy</hi> deſiſt from preaching any more unto them? No, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>watch thou in all things, endure affliction, make full proof of thy Miniſtry:</hi> Be diligent, perform thy duty, and leave the ſucceſs to God; Waiting if God peradventure will give them repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the Truth, and that they may recover themſelves out of the ſnare of the Devil, by whom they are led Captive at his will.</p>
                  <p>If they continue in their miniſterial labours, though no apparent good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be done by it, they want not great encouragement; <hi>They are to God a ſweet ſavour in Chriſt,</hi> not in them that are ſaved only, but in them that periſh too, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 15.

The Law (that is the Word of God) converts the ſoul; the Truth, that is, the Word of truth (ſo is the Goſpel called in oppoſition to the types and ſhadows of the Law) renews and ſanctifies the heart, according to our Saviour Chriſts Petition to his Father here in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Diſciples: <hi>Sanctifie them with thy Truth, thy Word is truth:</hi> And therefore you that are ſtrangers to the life of grace, be you intreated and prevailed withal to put your ſelves under the powerful preaching of the

The tree that ſpreads and flouriſheth, and brings forth much fruit, is ſaid by <hi>David</hi> to be <hi>planted by the water ſide,</hi> Pſal. 1.3. Even ſo the thriving and the growing Chriſtian, muſt be planted by the means, he muſt be near the Word of God, thoſe waters of the Sanctuary, as the Prophet calls them: That ſaving Doctrine muſt drop down upon him as the rain, it muſt diſtil upon him <hi>as the dew, and as the ſmaller rain upon the herbs, and as the ſhowrs upon the graſs,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.2. or elſe he will be like in time to wither, and decay, and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:46169:219"/>
ſanctifieth his people not only in a way of inchoation, but alſo in a way of augmentation? Then certainly thoſe men are in an ill condition, who though they conſtantly enjoy the preaching of the Goſpel, yet do not thrive nor grow by it; they hear it Sabbath after Sabbath, yea and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps repeat it with their families, and yet are not a jot the better for it any way. Look at what point they were for knowledge, practice and obedience many years ago, at the very ſame they ſtay; they are the very ſame men, there is no alteration on them, they have not gained any ground on their corruptions, they are not grown a jot more conſtant and fervent in religious duties then in former times. What is the reaſon that the Goſpel produceth not its genuine effect in theſe men, and that it bringeth forth no augmentation, no increaſe of inward grace, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience? the fault is not in the inefficacy of the Goſpel, ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, but in the hardneſs and deadneſs of their hearts; and as we uſe to ſay of ground that is manured and dreſt, and watered much, if it yieldeth no increaſe, that it is very barren ground; juſt ſo we may conclude of theſe men: And certainly their caſe is fearful, if they ſo continue, as the Apoſtle ſhews us in the ſame Similitude, Heb. 6.7. <hi>The earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſsed, receiveth bleſsing from God:</hi> But on the other ſide, <hi>that which bringeth bryers and thorns is rejected and nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned:</hi> And therefore I beſeech you my Beloved, as increaſe and growth in grace is one effect in Gods Word, ſo let it bring forth this effect in you; and that it may ſo do, I ſhall preſcribe you ſome directions.</p>
                  <p>Remove thoſe impediments that hinder growth and profiting by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Word of God, and they are principally ſuch as follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is pride and loftineſs of heart and ſpirit; for when a man is puft up with a ſelf opinion of his own ſufficiency, and thinks he knows as much as all the Preachers in the world can tell him, how can he profit by the Goſpel! He is ſo full that when the water of the Word is poured upon him, either it runneth over, and is ſpilt upon the ground, or elſe returneth back upon the face of him that poured it. If therefore you deſire to thrive by it, come to hear it my Beloved with teachable and humble ſpirits; the Lord will teach the humble his ways.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Infidelity or unbelief; for if we give no credit to the Word of God, if we believe not the report of the Word of God, his arm will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be revealed to us, we ſhall not benefit, nor profit by it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is yielded as the reaſon why the Jews were not a whit the better for the Word, Heb. 4.2. <hi>The Word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third impediment is ſtrong paſſion; for as obſtructions in the ſtomach hinder growth by bodily and outward food; ſo vehement and head-ſtrong paſſions do keep us from receiving growth and nouriſhment, and augmentation by the Word of God. You ſhall obſerve it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that men that have ſuch furious and unbridled paſſions in them, that will not be ſubdued by reaſon, nor by Scripture, do ſeldom profit by the preaching of the Goſpel; no, it muſt be received with meekneſs if
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:46169:220"/>
we mean to grow by it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.12. And therefore the Apoſtle yields it as the reaſon why the <hi>Corinthians</hi> could not bear ſtrong meat, ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſolid truths, their ſtomachs were not able to digeſt them, they were ſo cloid with theſe obſtructions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Prejudice againſt the gifts or perſon of the Teacher; this will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly abate the power, and hinder the ſucceſs and profit of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: If once the heart be prepoſſeſt with jealouſies and ſiniſter thoughts and diſaffection to the Miniſter, there is but little hope of any benefit that ſuch a man will reap by his labours. Theſe are the lets which we muſt labour to remove, if we deſire to thrive and grow by hearing of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If we deſire to grow and to increaſe by it, we muſt not hear it only, but labour to digeſt it too. A man ſhall never thrive and proſper by the meat he eats if he digeſt it not, unleſs there be concoction and aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it to the ſubſtance of the perſon that is nouriſhed. Let ſuch a perſon feed as plentifully as he will, there will be no augmentation. So let us hear as much and as often as we will, if we do not digeſt the Word of God, the bread of life, by ſerious meditation, by application of it to our own particular eſtate, there will be no increaſe of grace by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Laſtly, Let us ſeek to God by earneſt prayer, that he would bleſs his Word to us; that ſucking this ſincere milk, we may grow thereby: Paul <hi>may plant, and</hi> Apollo <hi>may water, but the ſucceſs</hi> (if any be) <hi>muſt be from God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. and therefore muſt ſeek it at his hands: Before we go to hear him ſpeaking to us in his Word, let him hear us ſpeaking to him in our prayers, that he would ſanctifie his holy Ordinance, and make it by his bleſſing to become a means of our increaſe in holineſs and grace, until we come to be compleat in Chriſt Jeſus: Seeing the Word is but an Inſtrument in his hand, let us pray that he would mannage it, and weild it, and make it powerful and ſucceſsful. Let us renew our Saviours ſupplication in the Text, every time we go to hear, <hi>Lord, ſanctifie us with thy truth:</hi> thy truth alone and of it ſelf will never do it, unleſs thou ſanctifie us by it, and therefore Lord do thou appear in this buſineſs: <hi>Sanctifie us with thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi>

               <p>OUR Saviour as he is a Mediator of Redemption to his people, ſo of Interceſſion too. He finiſhed the former (as his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is) and he began the latter, while he was here in this world. The Chapter is a model of it, wherein he gives his Apoſtles and Diſciples a fore-taſte, from which they might a little gueſs what he was like to do more fully for them, when he was aſcended and ſate down at the right hand of his Father, to be an everlaſting Advocate and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:46169:220"/>
for his Church and people. And here there are two things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, which he deſires in their behalf, to which at leaſt all the reſt may be reduced, Preſervation and Sanctification. He enters on the latter in the verſe now read, and ſo did we the laſt occaſion.</p>
               <p>And here we have as I have ſhewed you, the Supplication and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. The Supplication, <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth.</hi> The Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what is meant by truth, the Word of God, <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Lords-day I diſpatched the Supplication, ſo that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication comes to be inſiſted on at this time; <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeems to be an anſwer to the ſelf ſame queſtion which <hi>Pilate</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put to Chriſt himſelf, but would not tarry for a reſolution. What is truth? So <hi>ſanctifie them,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>with thy truth.</hi> But what is truth? you have the anſwer in the following clauſe, <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is the Word God, and there is the word of God. The one is Chriſt the Son of God; for he is called <hi>the Word</hi> in Scripture, and he is the Word God, as you may ſee that place for inſtance, 1 Joh. 1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> The other is the will of God revealed and manifeſted in the Scripture. And it is called <hi>the word of God,</hi> becauſe as the words of men diſcover what their mind is, which elſe you were not able to imagine; ſo the Word of God, the Scripture, diſcovers to us what the mind of God is, ſo far as it is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Now this Word, ſaith our Saviour here, is truth; <hi>Thy Word is truth.</hi> It is not only true, but truth it ſelf; and ſo indeed is all the Scripture; the Law and Goſpel both of them are all truth, conformable in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the Idaea of them in the mind of God. But yet the Goſpel is the Truth by way of Excellencie above the reſt of holy Scripture. Not that the Law, or any other part of the Old Teſtament, is not ſo true as Goſpel is; for there are no degrees in truth as truth. Words are either true alike; or ſome are true, and others falſe: But the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, and legal truths, are not be compared in ſome reſpects to the New Teſtament and Goſpel truths: Theſe have the odds and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the other; And therefore this, I mean the Goſpel, is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally called <hi>the Truth</hi> in the language of the Scripture, as I ſhall ſhew you more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>And this at leaſt is chiefly aimed at by our Saviour, when he ſaith, <hi>thy Word is truth;</hi> for of that truth he ſpeaks apparently, which is the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental means by which God ſanctifies his people. And that is not legal truth; God doth not ſanctifie men by the preaching of the Law, ſave only in a way of preparation and prediſpoſition. The Goſpel only works the truth and the reality of holineſs and grace, as I have ſhewed abundantly out of the former member of the Text. And therefore it is Goſpel truth that is eſpecially intended here, which is the only proper inſtrument of ſanctification. <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> So then the Obſervation lies before us.</p>
               <div type="section">

                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The word of God of God, eſpecially the Goſpel, is the Truth.</head>
                  <p>In proſecution of the Point, I have two things to cleer to you, before I come to application. Firſt, That the word of God is all truth; there is no falſehood or deceit in it, and I ſhall be brief on that. Then that the Goſpel is the truth by way of excellence, and in a ſpecialty above the reſt of Holy Scripture. I do not ſay the Goſpel is more true then other things contained in the book of God, but it is truth of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and of more uſe, as I ſhall make it evidently and diſtinctly to appear to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe, the word of God is all truth; ſo it is ſtiled in the letter of my text, without reſtraint or limitation, <hi>Thy word is truth.</hi> Whether it be the word of Hiſtory, the things that are hiſtorically repreſented to us in the Scripture, or the word of precept, or the word of promiſe, or the word of threatning, all is truth. If you look to the intention of the Author of the word, God hath delivered nothing in it with a purpoſe to deceive. Or if you look to the matter of the word, the things themſelves that are delivered in the Scripture, they are indeed as they are there expreſſed. <hi>The ſayings of the Lord are true ſayings,</hi> Apoc. 19.9. whether they be the ſayings of the Father, or the ſayings of the Son; For God the Father hath his ſaying, <hi>God ſpake theſe words</hi> in the preface to the Law. And God the Son hath his ſaying, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, if a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death,</hi> John 8.51. And both of theſe, the ſayings of the one and of the other, the ſayings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Law of works, the ſayings of the Son, the Law of faith, are abſolutely and exactly true, there is no falſhood or deceit in them; They are the true ſayings of God.</p>
                  <p>And they muſt needs be true, becauſe they are the ſayings of God. <hi>Thy word is truth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in my text. It is thine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truth. For he that is the author of it, <hi>he is the God of truth,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſtiles him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.5. Obſerve it well, he doth not ſay he is the true God in himſelf, and in his nature, but <hi>he is the God of truth</hi> in his diſcoveries and revelations of himſelf to men. All that comes from him is truth. <hi>He is the faithfull and the true witneſs,</hi> Apoc. 3.14. Not only true and faithfull as a God, but true and faithfull as a witneſs; And his word is his witneſs, not his ordinary ſaying only, but his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to confirm us and aſſure us of that which is delivered to us, to work and ſtrengthen faith in us. And therefore it is called the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, or the witneſs of the Lord, I think no leſs then twenty times in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Now for the ſecond branch, the Goſpell is the truth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and in a ſpecialty above the reſt of holy Scripture. <hi>Thy word is truth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour in my Text, that is thy ſanctifying word which is the Goſpell, <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law, (as far as I am able to remember) is nowhere called di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:46169:221"/>
by it ſelf the word of truth; but the Goſpel commonly, not in my Text alone but elſwhere often. Indeed the Pſalmiſt prayes to God, <hi>Take not thy word of truth away out of my mouth;</hi> but he intends the promiſes for which he hoped, as you may ſee in that place, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.43. <hi>And all the promiſes</hi> you know are Goſpel, <hi>they are in Chriſt yea, and in Chriſt Amen.</hi> But on the other ſide the Law is mentioned as in ſome reſpect contradiſtinct to truth. <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 17.</p>
                  <p>And yet you muſt not apprehend the Goſpel to be truer then the Law, or any parts of Scripture. If it be truer, they are abſolutely falſe. But it delivers truth of greater excellency then the reſt of Scripture doth, as will appear if you conſider either the ſubject matter of it, or the Revelation of it, or the Confirmation of it, or the Operation of it.</p>
                  <p>Goſpel truth excelleth for the matter of it. Chriſt is the ſubject <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> matter of the Goſpel, and therefore it is called the word of Chriſt, Col. 3.16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly,</hi> not of Chriſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor only, but of Chriſt the ſubject matter: and herein it ſurpaſſes and tranſcends, not all other Books only that handle other arguments, but even all other parts and parcels of the Book of God it ſelf. For Chriſt is the moſt pretious and delicious matter. He is the richeſt, and the ſweeteſt ſubject in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt the Subject of the Goſpel is the moſt rich and pretious ſubject. He is the wealth and treaſure of the faithfull ſoul; there is in him an endleſs Myne and infinite Maſs of ineſtimable riches. And therefore the Apoſtle having ſpoken <hi>of the riches of the glory of the Goſpel,</hi> adds in the words immediately anexed, <hi>which riches is Chriſt in you,</hi> Col. 1.27. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. A treaſure is much, but treaſures are more. But when all the treaſures that are in the world, ſhall be gathered together, and laid in a heap, there muſt needs be vaſt and riches. And this tranſported the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and ſwallowed up his thoughts and words, as unable to conceive it or expreſs it, yea even raviſhed him beyond himſelf, that he was <hi>entruſted to preach the unſearchable riches of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8. He found no end, no bottome of them, he could not reach the heigth, and depth, and length, and breadth of thoſe treaſures, they had ſuch immenſe and endleſs dimenſions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt the ſubject of the Goſpel, is the ſweeteſt and moſt delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubject in the world. It was the only thing that weakned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that <hi>Auſtin</hi> took in reading of a certain work of <hi>Cicero's,</hi> becauſe he could not find the name of Chriſt in it. That is a pleaſant name indeed to every true believing ſoul; and whereſoever that is found, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever writing hath that high and holy perſon for the ſubject of it, <hi>whom to know is life eternal,</hi> ſhould be read with full delight and high plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And therefore that which treats of Jeſus Chriſt, is ſtiled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, good news, and good tydings; <hi>yea good tydings of great joy.</hi> It tells us of a Jeſus, a Saviour, a deliverer out of bondage to ſin and Sathan and damnation, out of the moſt ſad and miſerable thraldom in the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:46169:222"/>
world; and this is infinitely ſweet. Oh with what melting, ſelf-conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming wiſhes and deſires doth the poor diſtreſſed Captive long to hear of a Redeemer? how welcome is this news to him? and ſuch a one is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to us, and therefore it is ſweet to hear of him. And as the Goſpel tells us of deliverance out of bondage, ſo of admiſſion to ſuch incomparable priviledges here, to ſuch unutterable happineſs hereafter, as cannot chooſe but melt the heart with raviſhing delight that hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a ſhare in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As Goſpel truth excelleth for the ſubject matter of it, Jeſus Chriſt, ſo for the manner of the revelation of it. The trurh in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was covered with a Vail, not of Types and Shaddows only, but of dark expreſſions too, ſo that it was obſcure and hid: But now it is unvailed as it were, and therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that we behold it now with open face,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. There is nothing now to hide it; The truth of the Old Teſtament is likened to the glimmering twilight in the dawning of the day, or to the faint and dimmer twinkling of a ſtar; But Goſpel truth is likened to the ſhining of the Sun at noon-day. And therefore we that live under Goſpel-revelation are called <hi>the Children of the light and of the day,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.5. And the Apoſtle tells us <hi>that now the grace of God which brings ſalvation hath appeared,</hi> Tit. 2.11. It is a Metaphor in which the Goſpel is reſembled to a glorious Light, that having been obſcured and masked awhile (even as the Sun when it is overcaſt and mufled with a dark and gloomy cloud) at length ſhines forth with admirable brightneſs and ſhewes it ſelf with darling ſplendor to the world. Though it were hid from ages and from generations, yet it is now made manifeſt unto the Saints, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Goſpel truth excelleth for the confirmation of it. It is better ratified then other truth. Truth may not be believed you know, it may not gain aſſent from thoſe that hear it, for want of ſolid and ſubſtantial confirmation: But Goſpel truth hath this preheminency, that it is now eſtabliſhed to the very utmoſt, by the death of Chriſt himſelf. <hi>He hath ſealed it with his blood,</hi> and therefore we have reaſon to believe it. Indeed the truth of the Old Teſtament was ratified and confirmed, yea it was confirmed in blood: But this was but the blood of Bulls and Goats; But now it is confirmed by the blood of Chriſt himſelf, which is a better and a more effectual confirmation. And this is that which the Apoſtle ſhews at large, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.16. and in the following verſes. So that the blood which ratified the Old Teſtament, was but the ſhaddow and the Type of that which ratifies the new; and therefore this hath the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the other. I muſt confeſs that the Old Teſtament was ratified by the death of Jeſus Chriſt in deſtination, <hi>for ſo he was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world:</hi> But this is ratified by the death of Chriſt in actual execution, which is if not in it ſelf, to us at leaſt, a cleerer and a better confirmation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Goſpel truth excelleth for the operation of it: it hath effects tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beyond all other truth that ever was revealed to the world. I ſhall name but two only ſuggeſted in thoſe two great Goſpel Epithites, <hi>the word of grace, the word of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="399" facs="tcp:46169:222"/>1. Goſpel truth works grace. Not common grace, and common ſorrow, and humiliation, and repentance as the Law doth, but ſaving grace: And therefore it is called <hi>the word of grace,</hi> Acts 20.32. It is ſo excluſively, it worketh grace alone, without the help and the aſſiſtance of the Law in that buſineſs. Something the Law may do towards us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but it doth nothing in the work of grace. <hi>Of his own will begat he us</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>by the word of truth,</hi> that is the Goſpel, <hi>James</hi> 1.18. That, only that is properly and ſtrictly ſanctifying truth, <hi>Sanctifie them with thy truth.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. Goſpel truth infuſeth life, and that no other truth can do. The Law indeed can kill, but it cannot make alive; It is the Miniſtry of death and condemnation. The Goſpel only is the Miniſtry of life and of Salvation. <hi>And therefore this exceeds the other, and ſurpaſſeth it in glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews at large, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this reſpect we find the Goſpel called <hi>the word of life,</hi> 1 John 1.1. becauſe it is the word that worketh life. It is the quickning word that raiſes men <hi>from death to life,</hi> to the life of grace in this world, and to the life of glory in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>And thus, I think we have ſufficiently cleered the point, the word of God, eſpecially the Goſpel is the truth. Proceed we now to make ſome application of it, according to the divers branches of the point in order. I ſhall but touch upon the firſt, becauſe I would no be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, my brethren, that the word of God is all truth? then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> it ought all to be believed. This truth on Gods part calls for faith on ours. <hi>For what is faith but the belief of truth?</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> defines it, 2 Theſ. 2.13. <hi>He hath choſen us to Salvation through Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> So that if the word be truth, it ought to be believed by us. And this our Saviour Chriſt inſinuates in his expoſtulation with the Jews, John 8.46. <hi>If I ſay truth, why do you not believe me?</hi> Though that which is delivered in the word of God be never ſo improbable, never ſo much above corrupt reaſon, never ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to a humane apprehenſion, yet it admitteth not of doubtfull Diſputation and Expoſtulation, but rather calls for abſolute belief.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they are deeply to be cenſured, who give no credit to the word of truth, further then their private ſpirits cloſe with it, who do not anſwer Gods truth with their faith. They read it and they hear it preached, but they yield no aſſent to it. No, they oppoſe it and diſpute againſt it, they are meer Scepticks in religion; There are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſuch in theſe times. <hi>They conſent not to wholeſome words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine which is according to godlineſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4. Whereas they that have ever felt the ſaving power of Gods word, have their thoughts captivated to it, and will ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>we can do nothing, we can ſpeak nothing againſt the truth,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.8. Theſe men upon the other ſide, when they hear the truth of God delivered to them, ſpeak againſt it, contradicting and blaſpheming, as the ſtubborn Jews did; <hi>Acts</hi> 13.45. They do not only ask with <hi>Mary, how ſhall this be?</hi> A queſtion not of
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:46169:223"/>
oppoſition, but of inquiſition, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.34. But even peremptorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine they can never be. And thus they belye the Lord, like thoſe of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. This in a word for application of the former member of the point. We ſhall now apply the latter.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo that the word of God, eſpecially the Goſpel is the truth? Is Goſpel truth excelling truth? Then let us give it the preferment before any other truth, both in our inquiſition and our acceptation. Let us dive into it moſt, and let us value and prize it moſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let us give it the due preferment in our inquiſition, let us dive into it moſt, and labour more to be acquainted with it then with any other truth. Let us read thoſe books, let us hear thoſe Preachers, and let us nouriſh thoſe ſtudies, which help us moſt to this knowledge; let us make this our main endeavour to be ſeen in Goſpel truth: let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue and neglect all other knowledge incompariſon of this. It is the dangerous miſtake of the greater part of men, who had rather be acquainted with the matters of the world, and to be skild in ſecular and humane learning, then in the doctrine of the Goſpel. How do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance plod to dive into the ſecrets and depths of nature, and ſet their wits upon the tenter-hooks, to ſearch into the myſteries of Arts and Trades! how do they beat and work their brains to get abundance of experience and skill in worldly dealings and employments! but take no pains at all in hearing, reading, meditation, to dive into the myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt. Tell me my beloved, have you ever among all your earneſt ſtrivings after inſight either into humane knowledge, or into matters of the world, been half ſo ſtudious and induſtrious to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Goſpel truth, to be acquainted with Chriſt Jeſus who is the ſubject of the Goſpel, to know that he was born, and lived and dyed for you, <hi>to know him and the virtue of his reſurrection,</hi> not by ſpeculation only, but experience, <hi>raiſing you up to newneſs of life,</hi> to know <hi>that he loved you, and gave himſelf for you?</hi> Alas the hearts of a great many of you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but tell you, that you have hardly ever ſpent a ſerious thought on this. And the very beſt among us cannot chooſe but ſay that we have been too ſlight and careleſs in our enquiries into this knowledge. Ah my beloved, had we the ſpirit of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> or of thoſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels, who deſire to peep and pry into the Goſpel truth as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. we would not fooliſhly miſpend ſo much of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious time, in empty, frothy and unneceſſary ſtudies, nor waſte away that Lamp of reaſon in our boſoms in unprofitable blazes, but we would ſet more time apart to look into the Patent of ſalvation, and to acquaint our ſelves with Jeſus Chriſt before hand, that when we come into his preſence at the latter day, we may be entertained as friends and not as ſtrangers. You hear that Goſpel truth is the ſtudy of the Angels, they had a little inckling of it, and it was ſo raviſhing, that they muſt dive and prie into it; they were not able to forbear it. Oh Fools and Ideots that we are that now the Lord hath made it plain to us we ſhould be ſo careleſs of it, that now the knowledge of it is attainable, we ſhould wilfully neglect that pretious truth which was ſo ſtudied and enquired
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46169:223"/>
into in Heaven, which Angels reacht after, and yet when all was done, came ſhort of the diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Since Goſpel truth excells all other truth, let us give it the preferment, as in our Inquiſition, ſo in our acceptation, and let us va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it and prize it above other truth. Every truth of God is pretious, but this truth is moſt pretious, and therefore ſhould be moſt eſteemed and layed up with moſt care. All the ſayings of God are worthy of acceptation, but Goſpel ſayings <hi>are worthy of all acceptation;</hi> 1 Tim. 1.15. all that is poſſible to entertain them with. And therefore the Prophets call the time of the Goſpel <hi>tempus acceptabile, the acceptable time, the year of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 16.2. And if we look into the Scriptures, my beloved, we ſhall ſee what worthy acceptation it hath found. <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus made haſte and received our Saviour gladly into his houſe,</hi> Luke 19.6. So did the brethren at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> receive the Apoſtles becauſe they brought the Goſpel with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.17. So did the <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans receive the Goſpel it ſelf with all readineſs of mind, or forward affection,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. So did the Galathians receive the Apoſtle with the honour of an Angel, even as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, becauſe he preached this excelling truth to them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.14. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in the Parable (you know) did dearly purchaſe it, the Saints did earneſtly contend for it, and took the Kingdom of heaven by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And hath it found the like eſteem with you my brethren? have you received and entertained it as a tranſcendent and excellent truth? have your ſouls been even raviſht with the knowledge of it? have you preferred it in your thoughts and your deſires before all other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yea before all other things? Alas how many are there that never valued it, who think it to be fooliſhneſs in compariſon of that which brings them worldly profit or advantage! It is a miſerable thing to ſee how this incomparable Goſpel is ſlighted in the world.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you my beloved; think upon it, what is it that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe? The wiſdom of God in a myſterie which is adorned with ſo many glorious Titles in the Scripture to raiſe our hearts and our affections to it, without which all the wiſdom and all the learning in the world is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but loſs and dung. And who is it that you deſpiſe in it? for the contempt and undervaluing of the Goſpel carries in it more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to every perſon of the Trinity, then any other ſin. It is a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full undervaluing of the Fathers wiſdom, which he hath ſhewed in no one thing ſo much as in the revelation of the Goſpel, and therefore it is called the wiſdom of God, as if the Goſpel were the ſhort abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſumm and the Epitome of Gods wiſdom. It is a fearfull ſlighting of the Fathers love, as if in all the buſineſs of our Saviours paſſion he had but put himſelf to needleſs compaſſion, and ſhewed ſuch love to men, as he might very wel have kept in his own boſome, for any thing we either need it, or care for it. It is an horrible contempt to Jeſus Chriſt, to ſuffer him to ſtand waiting at our doors, <hi>even till his head be full of dew, and his locks with the drops of the night,</hi> to put in his fingers by the hole of the lock, to humble, empty and deny himſelf, to ſuffer the indignities and wrongs of men, the heavy wrath of God
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:46169:224"/>
himſelf, and after all to have that pretious blood which was drawn out with ſuch woful agonies, and with ſuch exquiſite and horrid tortures, counted no other then the blood of a common Malefactor, no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded nor lookt after, no, though preſented and offered to us, and that with obſecrations and intreaties too; who is able to expreſs ſuch baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as this is! It is a high indignity to the bleſſed Spirit of grace to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to wait in vain, to move, and to perſwade in vain, to beg and to beſeech in vain, till we do even weary him, and ſend him ſad from us. Oh let us tremble of ſuch contemptuous uſage of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, in the contempt of their Goſpel; And henceforth let us receive it and embrace it as an excelling truth, as that which is of ſingular behoof and uſe, and conſequently calls for ſingular eſteem from us.</p>

And to this end I ſhall commend unto you, but theſe two things: Firſt you muſt maintain it as an excellent truth. Secondly, you muſt obey it as an excellent truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> This Goſpel truth muſt be maintained by you as an excellent truth. Indeed (my Brethren) you muſt ſtand for all Truth, you muſt never be againſt it, but you muſt be always for it, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, 2 Cor, 13.8. <hi>I can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth.</hi> But you muſt ſtand for Goſpel truth rather, and more then for any other truth, becauſe it is of more concernment, and of more uſe. We are more eager and earneſt in aſſerting the right and intereſt we have in things of worth, then in things of ſmaller value: That which is excellent, will have more to ſtand for it, then that which is comparatively mean and much inferior to it: and men will do it much more vehemently for a jewel then for a trifle: ſo let us in this caſe; and more particularly and diſtinctly let us earneſtly maintain this excellent Goſpel truth both by arguments and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us earneſtly maintain it by our Arguments and Reaſons. The more excellent a truth is, the more we muſt appear for it, the more extreamly tender we muſt be of any oppoſition that is made againſt it, the more we muſt endeavour to vindicate it and evince it, and to convince the gain-ſayers. It is no wiſdom for a man to lay out all his ſtrength and heat on points of ſmall conſideration, as many men who are as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and as hot in petty matters as it is poſſible for men to be, <hi>and ſtrive
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:46169:224"/>
as much about words</hi> (as the Apoſtles phraſe is) <hi>as they will about things.</hi> But when the weighty points of Goſpel truths come once in agitation, when they are contradicted and oppoſed (as they have been exceedingly of late days) then it behoves us to beſtir our ſelves, to draw up all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that we are able, to call in all the reaſon that we have, to defend and to make good ſuch excellent and pretious things as theſe are: We muſt contend for ſuch truths, for they are worth the ſtriving for with all our might; ſo the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> would have us, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>earneſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend or ſtruggle for the faith delivered to the Saints,</hi> Jude 2, 1. I think he doth not mean the grace of faith, but the doctrine of faith, which is the Goſpel; and therefore it is added preſently, <hi>for there are certain men crept in among you, turning the grace of God</hi> (which is the ſubject of the Goſpel) <hi>into laſciviouſneſs;</hi> ſo that you ſee my Brethren, Goſpel truth muſt be contended for, and that with earneſtneſs, even to an Agony; as once <hi>Apollos</hi> convinced the diſſenting Jews (who doubted of that great point of the Goſpel, whether Jeſus was that Chriſt or no) and he did it mightily, <hi>Act.</hi> 18.28. he did it as it were with all his might, <hi>being fervent in ſpirit,</hi> as it is ſaid at the 25. verſe; ſo that if any in theſe latter times have been too earneſt and too vehement (as ſome have thought) in aſſerting Goſpel truth, either in preaching, or diſcourſe, they may the better be excuſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us earneſtly maintain this excelling Goſpel truth, as by our arguments, ſo by our ſufferings, if God ſhall call us thereunto. It is an extraordinary honor and eſtabliſhment to any truth, when ſome are raiſed up to ſuffer for it. As on the other ſide it is a ſhame and a diſparagement when the profeſſors of it give it over, and relinquiſh it aſſoon as times of tryal come. Oh let not this diſhonour come on the Goſpel by our means: Let us ſtick to it, even to the loſs of goods, and liberty, and life it ſelf, let us ſeal it with our blood. Our Saviour Chriſt himſelf you know, did not think his blood too dear to ratifie the New Covenant, and to eſtabliſh and confirm the Goſpel, to ſeal the truth of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel promiſes. Let us not think that our blood is ill beſtowed, if it may ſerve in any meaſure to that end for which Chriſt ſhed his.</p>
                  <p>And as we muſt maintain this Goſpel truth as an excellent truth both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by our arguments and by our ſufferings: ſo we muſt obey it too as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent truth. And this way we ſhall honour it exceedingly, and hold it forth as excellent to all the world. Indeed it is a greater honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the Goſpel to obey it, then to defend it, and maintain it. We favour thoſe ſometimes whom we defend; we always honour thoſe whom we obey: And this my Brethren is the greateſt honour we can do the Goſpel, to ſet it up as our rule in our hearts, and in our lives: For you muſt know, my Brethren, that the Goſpel as it ſaves from miſery, ſo it requireth duty too: And hence we read not only of <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law,</hi> but of <hi>obedience to the Goſpel too,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8. And do you yield it this obedience? Do you live, and do you walk by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel rules? Brethren, I make no queſtion all of you expect ſalvation by the Goſpel: but do you hearken to the counſel and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel? You expect deliverance by it, but do you yield
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:46169:225"/>
obedience to it? I pray ſtand ſtill a little, and conſider with your ſelves, and accordingly reſolve. When you prophane Gods holy day, neglect the duties of his worſhip, either in publique or in private, blaſpheme his name, defraud and over-reach your Brethren; when you pleaſe your ſelves with actual or contemplative uncleanneſs; when you drink to drunkenneſs, or walk in any other ſinful courſes, be they what they will: what doth the Goſpel teach you theſe things? I ſay as the Apoſtle, <hi>have you ſo learned Chriſt</hi> out of the Goſpel?</p>
                  <p>Doth the pure and holy Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus give any approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch courſes? and do you think my Brethren, that the Goſpel will ever ſave you, if it do not guide and rule you? that it will ever make you happy, if it do not make you holy? Now I beſeech you my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, ponder it and weigh it well, and look for no ſalvation by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, unles you yield obedience to the Goſpel: For if you do, firſt you diſhonour it; and ſecondly, you diſappoint yout ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt you do exceedingly diſhonour it, you caſt a blemiſh and a ſtain upon it, you do not <hi>walk as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> but cauſe it to be evil thought, and evil ſpoken of by wicked men: as if Chriſt ſaved men that live and walk and perſevere in lewdneſs and prophaneſs, as if he favoured and allowed of ſuch courſes; as if he fitted and provided heaven for ſwearers, drunkards and unclean perſons. What kind of Doctrine may they think is that which holds out ſuch beatitude to be expected and enjoyed by ſuch wretches? Thus you prejudice the Goſpel, you caſt contempt upon it, and take away its excellency in the eyes of wicked men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whiles you expect ſalvation by the Goſpel, and do not yield obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Goſpel, you ſtrangely diſappoint your ſelves, and wofully delude your own ſouls; You may be confident of heaven while you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch courſes; but when you come thither you will be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, chap. 6.20. Believe it Brethren, ſalvation and inſtruction will not be divided: you muſt take them both together; you cannot have the former, without obedience to the latter. If you will hear and learn and practice what the Goſpel teacheth, you ſhall injoy that which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel offereth. If you will be obedient to the Goſpel, you ſhall be ſaved by the Goſpel, otherwiſe you cannot. As Chriſt is the Author, ſo the Goſpel is the Inſtrument of life and ſalvation to them that obey it. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon thoſe black Infernal Legions, that are already damned to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chains and darkneſs, ſhall be ſaved by the Goſpel, as they that caſt behind their backs the precepts of the Goſpel, and will not walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in their lives and converſations.</p>
                  <p>It is a dreadful ſentence to this purpoſe, able to break the hearts of wicked men, and to ſhake their joynts in pieces, 2 Theſſ. 1.8. <hi>The Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendring vengeance to them that know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Indeed as Goſpel truth is moſt excellent, ſo diſobedience to this Goſpel truth is moſt dangerous; we know what a fearful doom and dreadful ſentence the Apoſtle thunders out againſt it, Heb. 10.26. <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:46169:225"/>
truth</hi> (the Goſpel truth) <hi>there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> From which perverſly wreſted, though <hi>Novatus</hi> did extract that deſperate He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of his, denying hope of pardon unto thoſe who after they were once baptized, relapſed into ſin: Yet (thoſe uncomfortable inferences being laid aſide) this is moſt evidently taught us in that Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That where the mind hath been enlightned once with Goſpel truth, it tends exceedingly to the increaſe and aggravation of thoſe ſins that are committed after and againſt it. And therefore upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, labour to walk worthy of ſo glorious a Goſpel, and ſo great a Salvation.</p>

               <p>Proceed we to the arguments and reaſons with which he urgeth and enforceth this Petition &amp; requeſt of his. And they are two. Whereof the firſt is taken from the buſineſs and employment that he is ſetting them about; <hi>viz.</hi> the very ſame (in ſome reſpect at leaſt) which he himſelf hath hitherto ſuſtained and undergone by the appointment of the Father; <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, ſo I have ſent them into the world,</hi> I am now about to ſend them, it is as good as done already: (For yet they had not their Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel to all the world, to every creature.) And therefore thou hadſt need to ſanctifie them, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to his Father, by a more full diſcovery of thy truth to them, that ſo they may be fitted and enabled for ſuch a ſervice as this is. It is extreamly neceſſary that they ſhould be qualified with all the gifts and graces of the Spirit to the very utmoſt, being to go upon the very ſelf ſame errand and buſineſs on which thou haſt imployed me; <hi>Sanctifie them,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

               </p>

               <p>There is ſomething Comparative, in which our Saviour Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his Fathers ſending him with his own ſending his Apoſtles; <hi>As thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world.</hi>

and that as you have heard, is, that his Father hath ſent him down into the world; He would not ſuffer him to ſtay in heaven, but ſent him forth upon ſome weighty and important buſineſs; ſo that the point to be obſerved is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The Apoſtles and the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt are ſent by him, they are of Chriſts own ſending.</head>
                  <p>For the Apoſtles they have their very name from ſending. The word in the Original importeth ſuch a one as is diſpatched upon the errand of another, upon the buſineſs that another ſends him in: And Chriſt is often ſaid to ſend them. There are two memorable miſſions of them, mentioned in the Goſpel ſtory. The firſt a little after he had called them, Mat. 10.1, &amp;c. <hi>When he had called his twelve Diſciples</hi> (and they were his twelve Apoſtles, as they are ſtiled, ver. 2.) <hi>he gave them power againſt unclean ſpirits.</hi> And theſe twelve he ſent forth, ver. 1. and after at ver. 16. <hi>Behold I ſend you forth,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as ſheep among Wolves.</hi> The ſecond memorable miſſion of them was a little after he was riſen from the dead, and was even ready to aſcend, Joh. 20.21. <hi>Even as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> And this is that which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledges, that he was ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent</hi> me; what to do? <hi>not only,</hi> no not chiefly <hi>to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for ordinary Miniſters, I take the ſeventy Diſciples to be ſuch. And of them it is obſerved in the ſtory, Luk. 10.1, &amp;c. <hi>After theſe things the Lord appointed other</hi> 70. <hi>alſo, and ſent them two and two before his face;</hi> and addeth preſently, <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as Lambs among Wolves.</hi> It is a rule that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> lays down, Rom. 10.15. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> He doth not ſay unleſs they be gifted, but <hi>unleſs they be ſent.</hi> How ſhall they do the work and buſineſs of the Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>unleſs they be ſent</hi> by Chriſt? ſo that the point is clear you ſee, that the Apoſtles and the Miniſters of Chriſt are ſent by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But leaſt I be miſtaken here, I muſt interpoſe a caution. You muſt not underſtand that they are ſent by Chriſt Excluſively, that is, by him, and none but him: Neither as to the ſending of the Father and the holy Ghoſt, the other Perſons of the Godhead: Nor yet as to the ſending of the Church: Neither of them is excluded, when we ſay, That the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt are ſent by him.</p>
                  <p>They are not ſent by him Excluſively as to the ſending of the other Perſons of the Godhead, the Father and the Holy Ghoſt. The works of the Trinity without are undivided; and certainly it is their work as well as his, to ſend forth Miniſters into the Church; and hence it is not only ſaid, that Chriſt when <hi>he aſcended up on high, he gave ſome Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, and Teachers.</hi> Eph. 4.11. Some extraordinary, ſome ordinary Miniſters in his Church: But it is alſo ſaid, <hi>That God hath ſee ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 12.28. God hath ſent them, and that not God the Son only, but God the Father, and Holy Ghoſt too. Indeed the Scripture is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for this, that all the three concurred in this buſineſs. The Father thruſts forth Laborers into his Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.38. The Son gives
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:46169:227"/>
Miniſters in the fore-cited Text, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. The Holy Ghoſt makes Over-ſeers, Act. 20.28. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Over-ſeers:</hi> So that you ſee, Chriſt ſends not Miniſters exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively as to the ſending of the Father and the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor doth he ſend them in the ſecond place excluſively as to the ſending of the Church: She alſo hath a hand (my Brethren) under Chriſt, and by authority from Chriſt in this miſſion. Election appertains to her, according to the rule of Chriſt, ſhe chooſes out fit men, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3. So Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation appertains to her; I mean, ſhe doth it by her Officers, as <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. And Ordination as it is a Deſignation to the Miniſtry, ſo it is at leaſt a virtual and implicite ſending forth to the work of the Minſtry: And therefore Miniſters are called <hi>the Meſſengers of the Churches,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.23. Not the Meſſengers of Chriſt alone, but of the Church of Chriſt too: They are not only ſent by him, but they are ſent by her alſo; ſhe is the Wife, the Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo he ſuffers her to have a hand in ſending of her own ſervants; For ſo are Miniſters the Churches ſervants (though in ſome reſpects the Rulers, in other ſome the ſervants alſo) the ſervants of the Wife, and not the ſervants of the Husband only, as the Apoſtle inſinuates, 2 Cor. 4.5. <hi>We preach not our ſelves, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus's ſake:</hi> This ſhall ſuffice for clearing of the Obſervation by way of Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; here are ſome things that concern the Miniſters, and ſome things that concern the people; I ſhall proceed with them in order.</p>

                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Is it ſo, That the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt are ſent by him? This then may ſerve to let them ſee their great miſtake, who take upon themſelves the Office of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and yet are not ſent by him: Concerning whom he may complain, as God complains of thoſe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 23.21. <hi>I did not ſend them, yet they ran</hi> faſter then a good pace: They were forward of themſelves, but they were never ſent by me. Brethren, men may not call themſelves, or ſend themſelves, becauſe they think themſelves ſufficient; No, Jeſus Chriſt will call and ſend whom he pleaſes: For though he call not men imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from heaven now, as in the times of the Apoſtles, he calls and ſends them mediately ſtill, by the Churches ſuffrages, as you may ſee Act. 6.3. <hi>and by the laying on of the hands of the Presbyters,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And as it was a rule to the Levitical Prieſthood under the Law, Heb. 5.4. <hi>No man takes this honour on him,</hi> no man doth <hi>de jure</hi> take it, <hi>but he that is called of God as was</hi> Aaron: So to the Miniſtry under the Goſpel, <hi>no man takes this honour on him,</hi> but he that is ſent of Chriſt. There may be many private Souldiers in an Army, that may be fit to be Commanders, every way it may be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then ſome of them that do command, and yet they may not take upon them to be ſo, without a regular and due admiſſion. There may be many in the Common-wealth that may be fitter to be Juſtices of Peace then ſome of them that bear that Office, and yet they may not take upon them to be ſo, until they have received a Commiſſion: Or if they ſhould, it were impoſſible that their ſufficiency ſhould advantage
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:46169:227"/>
the Army or the Commonwealth ſo much, as the ill preſident which they would give, and the diſorder and confuſion they would make, would do it hurt; and ſo there may be many private Chriſtians, that may be fitter to be Rulers and Paſtors of a Congregation, then many that do rule and teach, and yet they may not take upon them to be either, until they be ſent by Chriſt: For if one may call himſelf, and ſend himſelf, a ſecond may, and ſo a third, and then they may be all Teachers, which is the thing that the Apoſtle implicitely at leaſt forbiddeth, 1 Cor. 12.19. <hi>And if all were one member, where were the body?</hi> as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks. And indeed, if any man put himſelf into an office meerly upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, becauſe he thinks himſelf ſufficient, the weakeſt will be moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and moſt conceited of their own ſufficience: and on the other ſide the ableſt men moſt modeſt, becauſe they beſt know their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And if you look on thoſe who call themſelves to be the Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of publick Congregations, and who impoſe themſelves upon them by force, and by a ſtrong hand, as ſome have done in theſe times, you ſhall not find them of the ableſt and the moſt judicious ſort of men; No, not of thoſe who are it may of their own opinion.</p>
                  <p>But you will interpoſe, and ask me then; What are not private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to imploy their gifts for the common benefit? Yes, to the very utmoſt, my Beloved; <hi>As every man hath received the gift, ſo let him miniſter the ſame one to the other, as good ſtewards of the manifold graces of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.16. Their gift they have received to profit withal, and that not themſelves alone, but others alſo; But ſtill within their own ſphere, within compaſs of their own calling: They may and ought as they are able, to teach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. in a way of conference; and this lies as a duty on them all, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: For this is no Evangelical counſel, but an Evangelical precept; it is not permitted only, but required: But none of them may take upon him to be the publick Teacher of the whole, without a due Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Ordination thereunto. <hi>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. How ſhall they do it lawfully? He doth not ſay except they be gifted, but <hi>except they be ſent.</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification is not enough, without miſſion: he muſt not go forth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but muſt be ſent forth by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, That the Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt are ſent by him?<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> This then may ſerve to let us ſee how far the power and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Miniſters extends in binding and in looſing, and in proclaming either war or peace. They do it but as ſervants in a miniſterial way, and by a delegated power; and in the execution of it, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly keep them by the rule and the directions which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him that ſent them. They may not act according to their own diſcretion, and as it ſeemeth good to them, but muſt proceed in every thing according to the orders and inſtructions of their Maſter. Or if they ſwerve a jot from theſe, they ſtray beyond the bounds of their Commiſſion, and their authority is void. So that the power of Miniſters in this regard, is Miniſterial, and declarative: Yet this I add, becauſe they do it by Commiſſion from the Lord, and as Meſſengers of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:46169:228"/>
Chriſt, it comes from them, by reaſon of his Ordinance, with more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the Conſcience, then from any private perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Is it ſo that the Apoſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This then may ſerve to mind them what their duty is, and I ſhall give it you in two words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They muſt do his work, and deliver his meſſage, the errand which he ſends them in. They muſt not bring their own devices to the people, their own fancies and conceits, the iſſue of their own brains, the froth of their own ſpirits, as many do in theſe times. No, they muſt ſpeak the words of Chriſt, and ſpeak them fully and compleatly. They muſt <hi>fulfill the word of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.25. They muſt without reſpect or fear, deliver all their Maſters meſſage, to any man to whom he ſends them, how great ſoever he may be. They muſt not out of baſe and ſervile dread of any, ſuppreſs or mince their errand in the leaſt degree, or deal ſo mannerly with men, that they become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to the Lord Chriſt. No, they muſt ſeriouſly conſider that though themſelves be mean and deſpicable perſons, yet they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Meſſengers of Chriſt himſelf, who is higher then the higheſt among men. And therefore as the Noble Roman ſaid, <hi>non ita memor ſum dignitatis veſtrae ut obliviſcar me eſſe conſulem;</hi> So they muſt ſay when they are dealing with the great ones of the world; I am not mindfull of dignity ſo far, as to forget that I am the Embaſſador and Meſſenger of Jeſus Chriſt. They muſt be bold and reſolute, with this aſſurance, that he that ſendeth them, will bear them out, according to his many preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes which he hath made for their encouragement to faithfulneſs in his ſervice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as they muſt deliver Chriſts errand, and not their own, ſo for Chriſts ends, and not their own; they muſt not ſeek their own profit, or their own honour, but the honour of their Maſter. As Chriſt who was the Fathers meſſenger, <hi>glorified not himſelf,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>but him that ſent him,</hi> Heb. 5.5. ſo they that are the meſſengers of Chriſt muſt not glorifie themſelves, but Chriſt that ſent them. They muſt act for him, and wooe for him, and win the ſouls of men to him. Their work muſt be to ſet him up, and to advance him that he may appear: They muſt with <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt be contented to decreaſe, to wither in their reputation and eſteem, ſo Chriſt may be in the increaſing hand. They muſt not endeavour to take ſuch a courſe in the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, that they may ſeem witty, and learned and eloquent, that men may admire them, and applaud their abilities, but that they may admire Chriſt, that the thoughts and affections of men may be carried to him; They muſt not preach themſelves, but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as the Apoſtle did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Is it ſo, that Apoſtles, Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then let the Church be here directed, and adviſed to prove thoſe that pretend they are the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, whether they be ſent by Chriſt or no. The Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is much commended for her care and diligence in this regard, Apoc. 2.2. <hi>I know thy works,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt there) <hi>and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canſt not bear them which are evil,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thou haſt tried them who ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:46169:228"/>
them lyers.</hi> They ſaid they were the Meſſengers of Chriſt; and that they were ſent by Chriſt (for thats the meaning of the word Apoſtle) but indeed they were not. The Church did not give them credit till ſhe tried them, and ſo diſcovered them to be impoſtors and deceivers.</p>
                  <p>And truly there are many ſuch in theſe times, who ſay they come from Jeſus Chriſt, when indeed he never ſent them. They are Meſſengers of Satan, and not of Chriſt: and therefore it concerns the Church to prove them well who come with theſe pretences, and to ſift them to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, that they may know not the ſpeech of theſe men only, but the power, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4 19.</p>
                  <p>And here you are not only to conſider, whether they have obtained the election and ordination of the Church or no; for many reach to this who are never ſent by Chriſt. But there are other things to be obſerved. I ſhall lay them down in order.</p>
                  <p>They that are ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, are furniſhed with competent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> at leaſt for the delivery of their meſſage. You muſt not think that Chriſt will ſend by the hand of a fool. No, if there be a Meſſenger of Chriſt, he is one of a thouſand for gifts and abilities. In the time of the Law when he raiſed up Prophets, what ſpirit, what power, what underſtanding was there in them? And is his hand ſhortned now, my beloved, in the dayes of the Goſpel? <hi>He is aſcended up on high, on purpoſe to give gifts unto men, for the work of the Miniſtry,</hi> Epheſ. 4.12. <hi>He makes able Miniſters of the New Teſtament,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.6. If he make them, they are able; and if they be not able, they are none of his making. Now this ability conſiſts eſpecially in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ability of knowledge. The Meſſenger of Chriſt is to deliver to the people the mind of Chriſt, the myſteries, the depth, the ſecrets of the Goſpel; Such depths as the Angels deſired to pry into, but could not find the bottom of them. And therefore Jeſus Chriſt endueth them with more then ordinary underſtanding in theſe things. They may not upon pain of being guilty of the blood, conceal the very Counſel of God; they muſt be able <hi>to evince the truth, and to convince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. To cleer the doubts of the erroneous, and ſatisfie the ſcruples of the tender conſcience. <hi>They muſt be filled with knowledge, their lips muſt be a ſtore-houſe of it, and at their mouths it muſt be ſought for by the people,</hi> Mal. 2.7. They muſt be ready upon all occaſion, to drop down the balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> the ſweet and pretious comforts of the Goſpel into the ſores of thoſe whom God hath wounded: To ſpeak even to the hearts of Gods people, <hi>to utter a word in due ſeaſon,</hi> to which alone is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <hi>the tongue of the Learned,</hi> Iſa 50.4. <hi>To preach Chriſt, and to deliver his errand with all wiſdom,</hi> Col. 1.28. And therefore whomſoever Chriſt ſends, he fitteth them accordingly in ſome meaſure. He gives them that which the Apoſtles calls <hi>underſtanding in the myſterie of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 3.4. and makes them Scribes taught to the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Ability of utterance. <hi>Behold I give you wiſdom, and a mouth,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his Apoſtles, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.15. So when he ſendeth forth his Meſſengers, he doth not only give them wiſdom and underſtanding in
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:46169:229"/>
the meſſage that he ſends them in, but he gives them a mouth too, to utter and communicate that wiſdom to the people. Or elſe what doth their wiſdom and their knowledge ſerve for, as Meſſengers or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, unleſs they have a mouth to bring it forth and to declare it to the people? I do not ſay that all the meſſengers of Chriſt muſt have volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tongues and fluent expreſſions. There was among the Prophets a ſtammering <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as a ſmooth and eloquent <hi>Aaron:</hi> A pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> blunt <hi>Amos</hi> for the Countrey, as well as a Rhetorical <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for the Court: among Goſpel Miniſters there was a chief ſpeaker, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.12. But yet however all that are ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, have in a meaſure that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>a door of utterance,</hi> Col. 4.3. a faculty to ſpeak to edification. The Prieſt of Old <hi>muſt have knowledge in his lips</hi> as well as in his head, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. And the reaſon is annexed, becauſe <hi>he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi> And you know a Meſſenger or an Embaſſador muſt not be dumb, but able in ſome handſome terms to utter and expreſs the errant of his Maſter. And this is intended, when the Apoſtle ſpeaking of a Miniſter, ſaith, he muſt be apt to teach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> They that are ſent by Jeſus Chriſt, as they are furniſhed with ability, both of knowledge and of utterance: ſo they are qualified with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity. And this is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>a ready mind to feed the flock,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.2. <hi>and a good will to deal to the people the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.8. Suppoſe he have ablility, yet if he have no mind to uſe it for the benefit and profit of the Church of Chriſt, no zeal to ſtir up the gift that is in him, but is remiſs and idle, and prefers his eaſe and pleaſure before the bringing in of ſouls to Chriſt, it is a ſhrewd preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that Jeſus Chriſt did never ſend him.</p>
                  <p>But if he can be well content to ſpend himſelf and to be ſpent for the ſalvation of the peoples ſouls; if as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> he <hi>be a burning and a ſhining light,</hi> waſting himſelf and burning out, that he may give the people light: If he <hi>account it</hi> (as his Maſter did) <hi>his meat and drink to do the will of him that ſent him,</hi> John 8.34. ſo that he is not in his Element unleſs he be about his Miniſterial work; If he reſolve with the Apoſtle, <hi>this will I do if God permit,</hi> and think no peril nor no pains too great that he may <hi>finiſh his courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> it is very probable that ſuch a one is of Chriſts own ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They that are ſent by Jeſus Chriſt are qualified with ſincerity. I do not mean ſincerity as Chriſtians, but as Meſſengers of Chriſt, in the delivery of their meſſage without addition or ſubſtraction, <hi>In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine ſhewing uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſincerity, ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned, Tit.</hi> 2.7. And this is that which <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf profeſſes he had done, 2 Cor. 2.17. <hi>We,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are not as many that corrupt the word of God; but as of ſincerity, and in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> The Steward and the Meſſenger of Chriſt, as he is wiſe, ſo he is faithfull; a faithfull and a wiſe ſteward. He doth not for his own ends adulterate the Meſſage of his Maſter, or coin a Meſſage from him, which he never ſent him in. And hereby you ſhall know him from another, that was
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:46169:229"/>
never ſent by Chriſt. As Chriſt ſpeaks of falſe Prophets, <hi>by their fruits you ſhall know them,</hi> Mat. 17.16. that is, by their fruits as Prophets, not as men; Not by the fruits of their perſons, but the fruits of their doctrine: The ſame may be applied to the falſe Meſſengers of Chriſt, <hi>by their fruits you ſhall know them.</hi> If the doctrine which they teach, and the meſſage which they bring, be not the ſame which they have received from Chriſt; if they ſpeak not the words of Chriſt, but fancies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of their own; if they deliver that which is againſt Chriſt, againſt the Word and Spirit and Ordinances of the Lord Chriſt; which tends to looſeneſs and licentiouſneſs (as many do in theſe times) believe it they are none of Chriſts ſending.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Apoſtles and Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then certainly they ought to be <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> received by you, and ſo received, as thoſe that come from ſuch a one as Chriſt is. As Chriſt ſhould be well entertained becauſe the Father hath ſent him, ſo the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be well entertained becauſe he hath ſent them. Oh how welcome ſhould we bid them who come from ſuch a dear pretious friend as Chriſt is? How beautifull and lovely ſhould their very feet, their uncomlieſt parts be? What are you come from Jeſus Chriſt indeed? hath he ſent you? are you come from our Maſter, our Husband, our Head? You are very welcome to us.</p>
                  <p>And here to be a little more diſtinct, the welcome entertainment we ſhould give them, conſiſts eſpecially in two things, to name no more at this time.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt give them honour, as thoſe that come from Jeſus Chriſt; Yea double honour, the honour of reverence, and the honour of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. The Meſſengers and the Embaſſadors of Jeſus Chriſt, muſt be received and entertained with all reſpects by you; Or if they be not, he eſteemeth their diſhonour as his own. <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And verily, if this be true, he was never more deſpiſed then in theſe dayes. Oh my beloved, what floods of ignominy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn are poured out upon the Meſſengers of Jeſus Chriſt, thoſe that are moſt faithfull to him? ſo that abundance of them are hardly able to bear up againſt the venome that men ſpit upon them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt give them audience as thoſe that come from Jeſus Chriſt, conſidering that the meſſage they deliver is Jeſus Chriſts and not their own: and therefore when at any time you are adviſed by them to come in and ſtoop to Chriſt, Oh think that Chriſt himſelf doth counſell you and call upon you. And when they offer peace and mercy and atonement, and beſeech you to accept it; Oh think that Chriſt himſelf beſeecheth and entreats you by them, and therefore do not baffle him and ſlight him, and put him off with a denial; for if you do, it is a moſt unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable provocation. O think as often as you hear them ſpeaking to you, that you are hearing Chriſt himſelf from heaven, and then conſider how you dare to ſlight them. <hi>For you deſpiſe not men but Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in this caſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that the Apoſtles, Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this then ſhould teach you in <label type="milestone">

you; Conſidering that they are but ſervants and cannot but deliver the meſſage of their Maſter; its that to which their place and calling, and the truſt which Chriſt hath put into their hands doth bind them: which truſt they muſt diſcharge and not betray, be the hazard what it will; and therefore be prevailed withall to take all in good part, and not to think them injurious to you, becauſe they dare not to be unfaithfull to Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>YOU ſee, he doth not tell his Father, I have ſent them into <hi>Jewry</hi> only, or into any other Region of the earth, but <hi>I have ſent them into the world;</hi> That is the local object of their Miſſion, the world at large without reſtraint or limitation, <hi>all the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed our Saviour once profeſſed of himſelf, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.24. And ſo accordingly when firſt he ſent forth his Apoſtles, his expreſs injunction was, <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, but go ye rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 10.5. At his aſcention he appointed them to be his witneſſes, firſt in <hi>Judaa</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 1.8. This courſe and method the Apoſtles very carefully obſerved, as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 13 46. <hi>It was neceſſary</hi> (ſay <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> unto the Jews) <hi>that the word of God</hi> (the Goſpel) <hi>ſhould firſt of all be preached unto you.</hi> But if you mark it well, my brethren, the final and the laſt Commiſſion of our Saviour was, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28.19.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay that this was a Commiſſion proper to Apoſtles, and doth not any whit concern ſucceeding ordinary Miniſters, and Paſtors in the Church, who are reſtrained to ſpecial places, and fixed in ſpecial Congregations.</p>
                  <p>I grant indeed that many ordinary Miniſters are reſtrained and fixed ſo; but all are not ſo reſtrained, neither are any ſo reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that they may in caſe remove to other places and to other Countreyes. And in that any are reſtrained and fixed, it is not meerly as they are Miniſters of Chriſt, but as they are the choſen Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Paſtors of ſuch a Congregation or of ſuch a people. Their Commiſſion as from Chriſt, doth not fix them anywhere, but leaves them free as I have ſaid, to exerciſe their Miniſtry whereſoever they are called in all the world. Indeed the Apoſtle tells us that God hath ſet ſome in the Church, ſome Miniſters of all ſorts, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. He hath placed and fixed them there. But that is out of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:46169:230"/>
the univerſal Church which is not limited to any Countrey, but is to be extended over all the world. For if you mark it, the Apoſtle ſaith not, God hath ſet ſome in the Churches, in the plural number, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Church, and that in ſuch a latitude as that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth in it all gifts, all members, all officers of all ſorts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intended of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or any ſingle Congregation, but only of the univerſal Church of Chriſt on earth. There Chriſt hath ſet his Miniſters, not his Apoſtles only, but his ordinary teachers; and if they be confined to narrower limits, it is not properly by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but by a call from men, or by ſome other ſecundary means. And as for that Commiſsion mentioned even now, <hi>Go ye and teach all Nations,</hi> though it were given immediately to the Apoſtles, it cannot be reſtrained to the Apoſtles, being evidently meant, in and with them, of all the Miniſters and Preaches of the Goſpel that ſhould ſucceed them in the Church to the end of the world. And therefore it is added preſently in the next verſe. <hi>Lo, I am with you alwayes to the end of the world.</hi> They were not to continue for their own parts, by many hundred years ſo long, and therefore it muſt alſo ſtretch to thoſe who were to follow them in the office and work of Goſpel-preaching, till it be publiſhed univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to all Nations: which was not done you know by the Apoſtles; it was but begun by them, and muſt be carried on till it be finiſhed by other Miniſters of Chriſt in ever age ſucceſſively to the end of the world; So that the point is clear you ſee; Chriſt doth not ſend his Miniſters particularly or reſtrictively to any Countrey or to any Nation, but their Commiſsion leaves them free to all the world.</p>
                  <p>And there are two great reaſons of the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> is to be erected, and his Church is to be planted over all the world in every Countrey and in every Nation, under heaven. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Jeſus Chriſt doth ſend his Miniſters to all the world, for this purpoſe, for the erecting of the one, and the planting of the other.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His Kingdom is to be erected over all the world. It is not bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or confined to any Countrey, or to any Nation, but it is to ſtretch and to extend it ſelf to all places, and to all people. And hence the Kingdom of the Lord Chriſt is likened to a ſtone that ſwells into a Mountain, and in the end repleniſhes the world, as Dan. 2.35. <hi>The ſtone that ſmote the Image, became a great Mountain, and filled the whole earth.</hi> A very fit reſemblance of our Saviours Kingdom. Firſt it is a little ſtone, it lyes within a little compaſs, it is confined within very narrow limits; but yet at length it grows into a Mountain, yea a great Mountain, it ſtretches and extends out it ſelf exceedingly, and in the end repleniſhes the whole earth. The beginnings are but ſmall, a little ſtone, a man may put it in his pocket, but the ſtone becomes a Mountain, and the Mountain fills the world. And this is that which the ſame <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> in his viſion did foreſee, as if it had been done already, Dan. 7.14. <hi>And there was given him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>dominion, and glory and a Kingdom,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Lord Chriſt) And what Kingdom ſhall he have? See in the following words; he ſhall have ſuch a Kingdom, <hi>that all the people, Languages, and Nations in the world ſhall ſerve him.</hi> There is a Prophecy to
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:46169:231"/>
this purpoſe, Pſal. 22.27, 28. <hi>All the ends of the world ſhall turn to the Lord, and all the kinreds of the Nations ſhall worſhip before him; For the Kingdom is the Lords, and he is the Governour among all Nations,</hi> with which accordeth that, Pſal. 72.8. <hi>He ſhall have Dominion from Sea to Sea, and from the River unto the ends of the Earth:</hi> and yet again, Pſal. 86.9. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made</hi> (and you know there is no Nation which he hath not made) <hi>ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall glorifie thy Name:</hi> This is the meaning of that famous Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our King himſelf, Mal. 1.11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame, my Name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place incenſe ſhall be offered to me, and a pure offering; for my Name ſhall be great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts:</hi> And when all theſe predictions ſhall be brought to execution, then ſhall that which was repreſented in a Viſion unto <hi>John</hi> be really accompliſhed, Apoc. 7.9. <hi>I beheld,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and loe a great multitude, which no man could number, of all Nations and kinreds, and people, and tongues, ſtood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, cloathed with white Robes, and Palms in their hands:</hi> and then ſhall that triumphant voyce take place, Apoc. 11.15. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world are become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now how ſhall this be brought to paſs, my Brethren, but by the preaching of the Goſpel over all the world, which by our Saviour Chriſt himſelf is called <hi>the Goſpel of the Kingdom?</hi> Mat. 24.14. becauſe his Kingdom is erected by it; and that is the firſt reaſon, why Chriſt ſends forth his Miniſters to preach the Goſpel over all the world, that ſo his Kingdom may be erected by it over all the world. <hi>This Goſpel of the Kingdom</hi> (ſaith our Saviour in the fore-alledged place) that is, this Goſpel by which my Kingdom is ſet up, and propagated and enlarged, <hi>ſhall be preached in all the world, to all Nations, and then ſhall the end come:</hi> When this is done, this Goſpel preached, and this Kingdom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by propagated unto all the world, <hi>then</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) and not till then <hi>ſhall the end come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as the Kingdom of our Saviour is to be erected, ſo Churches (in the ſecond place) are to be planted over all the world: And that is another reaſon why Chriſt ſends forth his Miniſters to preach the Goſpel over all the world; for Goſpel preaching ſerves as to erect the one, ſo to collect and plant the other.</p>
                  <p>The Church indeed was antiently ſhut up among the Jews, but now it is let out to all Nations, ſo that <hi>neither Jew nor Grecian, neither Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian nor Barbarian,</hi> is excluded from the Church. <hi>Thou haſt redeemed us by thy blood,</hi> ſay the Elders to our Saviour, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.9. not out of one, <hi>but out of every Kindred, Nation, Tongue and People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This enlargement of the Church is clearly taught us in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2.23. which may ſerve inſtead of all; <hi>And I will ſow her to me in the earth,</hi> ſaith God there, which is a Metaphorical or borrowed ſpeech, by which the Lord fore-ſhews the great extenſion of the Church in theſe latter Goſpel days; For as the Husbandman that means to have his Corn increaſed and multiplyed, firſt ſows it in the ground, that ſo
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:46169:231"/>
it may take root and ſpring and bear him many grains for one; ſo God affirming he will ſow his Church, inſinuates he will make it do as corn when it is ſowen, to grow and multiply exceedingly. So that from a very ſmall, it ſhall encreaſe to a great number. And hence he ſaith not <hi>I will ſow her</hi> in the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> only, but <hi>in the earth</hi> at large with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtraint or limitation. In former times, he made his breach in <hi>Iewry</hi> only; his field the Church was but a little corner of the world; but here the Lord fore-ſhews, that he will multiply her ſo, that ſhe ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed over all the earth; <hi>And I will ſow her to me in the earth:</hi> And for this reaſon, Jeſus Chriſt ſends forth his Seedeſmen into all the Earth, that they may ſow the Church in all Countries. This ſhall ſuffice for clearing of the point.</p>
                  <p>And is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt doth not ſend his Miniſters particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> or reſtrictively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This then may ſerve my Brethren, in the firſt place at leaſt to juſtifie the practice of thoſe Miniſters of Chriſt, who for the propagating of the Church of Chriſt and elarging of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, have done as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed he had ſtrived to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.20. ſaith he, <hi>I have ſtrived to preach the Goſpel not where Chriſt was named, leaſt I ſhould build upon another mans foundation; but as it is written, To whom he was not ſpoken of they ſhall ſee, and they that have not heard ſhall underſtand.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Preached when a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection was made for propagation of the Goſpel in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </note> You heard even now of many zealous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Chriſt, who have had the ſame deſign, <hi>viz,</hi> to preach the Goſpel in <hi>America,</hi> where Chriſt was never named till within theſe few years. To lay the firſt ſtone of the Foundation of Religion there, to gather Churches, and to erect the Kingdom of the Lord Chriſt among the poor blind <hi>Indians,</hi> in the remoteſt quarter of the world, That ſo the Fathers promiſe may at length be made good to Jeſus Chriſt, Pſal. 2.8. <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſsion.</hi> And verily in this my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they have not gone beyond their line, they have not ſtrayed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of their Commiſſion. Chriſt doth not ſend his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as you have heard, particularly or reſtrictively to any Countrey, or to any Nation, but their Commiſſion leaves them free to all the world: Even the Commiſſion, not of Apoſtles only, but of the ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt, as I have ſhewed before in Explication of the point: ſo that they are within their compaſs ſtill, though they be among the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> even at the other end of all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be very much obſerved, that Chriſt hath given abundant teſtimony to this glorious work of theirs, in the incredible ſucceſs of their endeavours there, ſo that poor naked ſouls come continually to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſtoop to the Government and Scepter of his Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be acquainted with his will, to be inſtructed in the way of his worſhip, to have their children brought up in the nurture and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord; And in a word, they ſhame us who have ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Goſpel, that we are even weary of it, and begin to put it from us, and ſo to judge our ſelves unworthy of eternal life. The Lord in mercy grant it go not from us to the <hi>Indians,</hi> who prize it more, are more eager after it, and more fruitful under it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:46169:232"/>
to their light, then multitudes of us profeſſed Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are.</p>
                  <p>Now I beſeech you my Beloved, caſt an eye upon them, travail thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in your thoughts and meditations; there you ſhall ſee ſome Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt, once our fellow-Labourers, ſpending themſelves, undergoing difficulties without number or meaſure, to convert ſouls, and gather Churches among blind Heathens. There you ſhall ſee the Goſpel bloſſoming, the Church enlarging her Tent, and ſtretching forth the Curtains of her habitation, the Doves flocking to the windows of the Ark, the Church of Chriſt, the fulneſs of the Gentiles now beginning to come in; and in a word, that great work going on, which is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the moſt remarkable that Chriſt hath yet to do in this world.</p>
                  <p>What ſhall we do now, my Beloved, and how ſhall we behave our ſelves under ſuch a diſpenſation? ſhall we (as many have done hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and it may be yet do) condemn the Inſtruments, as if they went beyond themſelves in this buſineſs? Shall we mock at theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the building of the Temple? ſhall we deſpiſe the day of ſmall things? ſhall we as <hi>Gallio</hi> care for none of theſe matters?</p>
                  <p>Truly the leaſt that we can do, is to comply with Jeſus Chriſt in this deſign of his, for which he ſends his Miniſters into the world, and to promote this glorious work to the utmoſt of our power. It is in the hands of thoſe for whom (as you have heard) it is too heavy, ſo that they cannot mannage it, they are not able to go through with it. They ſeem to call over to us, as the man of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> Come to <hi>America</hi> and help us. Oh let not ſuch a work miſcarry, and fail of being driven on, for want of any help that we can yield to it, a work that is ſo purely Chriſtian as this is.</p>
                  <p>But which way can we help it on? it may be you will ſay to me. Truly my Brethren, if no other way, we may promote and help it on at leaſt without purſes and our prayers. This we may do at this diſtance. I ſhall ſpeak a word to either.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We may promote it with our prayers. This was the courſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet took as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. In the precedent chapter he is very large, and eloquent on this buſineſs; ſhewing the future glory of the Church, by the addition of the fulneſs of the Gentiles in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and in all Nations. And having done with the deſcription of it in two whole Chapters, me thinks he is an end to haſten the fruition of it: <hi>For</hi> Zions <hi>ſake I will not hold my peace,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and for</hi> Jeruſalems <hi>I will not reſt.</hi> So we, my Brethren, having heard of the beginning of this great work in <hi>America,</hi> let us do as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did, let us be always crying to the Lord, let him be hard beſet on all hands, let him not have a quiet hour. The Lord hath ſet his Watchmen on the walls of his <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.6. that they may watch ſuch opportunities as theſe are. And leaſt he ſhould forget this great work, when it is upon the wheel, he hath appointed ſome remembrancers to mind him of it, and therefore let us be continually minding God of this buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him to go on with this work, till he hath brought it to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:46169:232"/>
till the whole fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, till Chriſt inherit all Nations. Let us remember that we have a little ſiſter in <hi>America,</hi> and that now is the day of ſpeaking for her, for now her caſe and buſineſs is in agitation; and therefore now let us be earneſt with the Lord, let us pray and pray hard, let us not be cold or dead in ſuch a ſuit as this is.</p>
                  <p>We may promote it with our purſes and eſtates: And this is that eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we have in hand at this time. There are very many things in that great buſineſs now on foot, that need pecuniary helps, as hath been ſaid. The charge that lies on theſe that are the agents in it, is exceeding great, and indeed too heavy for them; and therefore we (me thinks) that ſhare not in the difficulties and the labours that other of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren undergo among the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſhould be content to ſhare a little in the coſts; for who would willingly ſit wholly out in ſuch a bleſſed work as this is?</p>
                  <p>Alas, my Brethren, how much idle mony do we ſpend a hundred ways, that might be ſaved for ſuch a purpoſe! And truly I believe, we never had occaſion to lay mony out to a better end then this. Now we may help, in a qualified ſenſe, to purchaſe ſouls with money, to further the accompliſhment of the Goſpel promiſes with money; we may make tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and earthly things ſerve ſpiritual and heavenly ends.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I beſeech you, my Beloved, enlarge your bounty more then ordinary, in ſuch a choiſe and extraordinary work as this is. Let love to Chriſt and to his Church, compaſſion to thoſe blind <hi>Americans,</hi> draw out your very hearts to them, that thoſe poor <hi>Indian</hi> ſouls, whoſe Converſion and Salvation you may further by this means, may bleſs you. Thus make you friends of the unrighteous Mammon, that you may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up a good account when the day of reckoning comes.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, That Jeſus Chriſt ſends forth his Miniſters into the world, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> that (as I have ſaid) to gather Churches, and erect his Kingdom over all the world? Then let this raiſe our hearts, my Brethren, in reference to this work, which is indeed the greateſt and the moſt eximious that Chriſt hath yet to do in this world. Oh let our hearts be lifted up towards it, and that eſpecially three ways, in faith, in expectation, in Petition. I ſhall ſpeak to them in order.</p>
                  <p>Let our hearts be lifted up in faith, with reference to this work; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Let them be raiſed to a full and firm belief, that it ſhall ſurely be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in the Lords own time. Chriſt hath ſent forth his Miniſters about it, and brought it on a great way, and therefore let us reſt upon it, that he will ſurely finiſh it in his ſeaſon. It may be you may look upon it as a thing almoſt impoſſible, that all the Nations of the world ſhould turn to Chriſt, and receive him for their King. But if you will caſt back your eye on the beginnings of this glorious work, you cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it was as hard to bring it on to what it hath attained already in the world, as to perform that which remaineth to be done; All that which we expect is not ſo hard, as that which Chriſt hath done already.</p>
                  <p>If you had ſeen him here upon the Earth, and his fiſhermen about him, you would not have imagined that ſo many Nations would ever
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:46169:233"/>
have been brought in to him, as there are at this day. When he ſent out a company of poor deſpiſed men to preach the Goſpel, and to draw men in to him, by telling them <hi>they muſt deny themſelves, and they muſt take up their Croſs and ſuffer perſecution for his ſake; they muſt forſake all, leave all and follow him;</hi> you would have thought this had been an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely way to do very great matters. And yet by ſuch improbable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely means as theſe, hath Chriſt been entertained in many Nations, and many Countreyes, and multitudes of people have been brought to ſtoop to him. And therefore ſeeing he hath done ſo much already, and that in ſuch a ſtrange way, as you would never have believed, if you had not ſeen it done, you may the better caſt your ſelves upon him, with this aſſurance that he will overcome the difficulties that are yet behind, that he that hath begun the work, and proſpered it ſo far as he hath done, will finiſh it untill he hath brought in the fulneſs of the Gentiles to his Church and Kingdom, from one end of the earth unto the other.</p>

                     </label> But you will ask me now perhaps, <hi>What, would you have us to believe that all the people of the world ſhall accept of Jeſus Chriſt, and receive him for their King, and be the Subjects of his Kingdom? Why then it ſeems there ſhould be no tares, no Goats, no wicked when that time comes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sol.</note>No, my beloved, this is not the thing at which I aim: And therefore you may not be miſtaken, you muſt remember that diſtinction of the Kingdom of Chriſt Ieſus, into the Kingdom of power, and the Kingdom of grace.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe indeed is univerſal, and doth already reach to all places and to all perſons. Though all be not the ſubjects of the grace of Chriſt, yet all are ſubject to the power of Chriſt. And hence the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt tells us, that his Kingdom rules over all, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.19. And that he is the King of all the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.7. he is King of all the places in the earth, yea and of all the perſons in the earth either one way or the other. Either he is a gracious King to rule them, or a powerfull King to break them. And thus his Kingdom doth already reach to all Countreys, and to all people.</p>
                  <p>But now my brethren, for the ſecond Kingdom which we have called the Kingdom of grace, that is alſo in a ſence, to ſtretch and to extend it ſelf to all places, and to all people. I ſhall clear it very briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is to ſtretch and to extend it ſelf to all places and to all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes. The Church of Jeſus Chriſt is to be Catholick in this reſpect, and ſo by conſequence his Kingdom too, it is to be erected and ſet up in all Nations. And hence the Holy Ghoſt affirmeth, <hi>that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Languages, and Nations in the world ſhall ſerve him.</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us that in the buſineſs of ſanctification, or ſetting up the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt Jeſus in the hearts of men, <hi>there is neither Greek nor Jew, neither Scythian nor Barbarian, but Chriſt is all in all.</hi> That is, the Jew is not preferred before the Greek, and neither of them is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the Scythian and Barbarian, but all of them are one to
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:46169:233"/>
Chriſt, and Chriſt is one to all of them: and he will have a Church and Kingdom as well among the Scythians and Barbarians, as among the Jews themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as this Kingdom is to ſtretch and extend it ſelf to all places, and to all Countreyes, ſo it is alſo to extend it ſelf to all people; That is, to all degrees and ſorts of people, though not to all of thoſe ſorts. And as there is no Nation, ſo there is no condition or eſtate or rank of men excluded from the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, nor barred from being ſubjects of his gratious Kingdom here, and of his glorious Kingdom hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Let our hearts be lifted up in expectation of this glorious work.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Since Chriſt hath ſent forth his inſtruments about it, to gather Churches, and to erect his Kingdom over all the world, and ſince the work hath proſpered very far, and now is going on amain among the Indians, let us not lye ſtill and idle, as if we knew not what is a doing in the world. Now Chriſts work is in his hand, let our eyes be in our heads, and let it raiſe up extraordinary expectations in us; The Prophet having had a glymps of this moſt excellent and glorious work in contemplation, when it was not yet begun, is on tip-toe preſently, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.1. And ſo let us, eſpecially now we behold it in the execution, let us lift up our heads and look, let us get up on our watch-towers where we may have more advantage to ſee, if by any means we can diſcover more of it: and let our ſpirits be continually reaching after the fufilling of it, as being full of hope about it.</p>
                  <p>Let our hearts be lifted up in ſupplication for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of this work. Not that we can change the Lord by any means, or antedate his Counſels and Decrees; but yet if we would have ſuch glorious works to come to execution, it is extreamly neceſſary for us to do that on which the execution of them is ſuſpended in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>I will build the ruined, and I will plant the deſolate and deſert places, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Ezek. 36.37. I will build the ruined Nation of the Jews, which was a Church in former times, and I will plant the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and deſert places of the Gentiles; <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and I will do it;</hi> But yet on this condition, <hi>that I will be enquired of by my people.</hi> The Lord will ſurely come (my brethren,) in his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeaſon, and gather Churches, and erect his Kingdom over all the world. But in the mean time he will have his people pray, <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come;</hi> he will have them haſten him and fetch him by their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that he may ſay unto them, as the Angel did to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 10.12. <hi>From the firſt day that thou didſt ſet thy ſelf to underſtand, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words,</hi> And here to quicken you a little, I ſhall preſent you with a few Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord expects you ſhould be very earneſt and importunate with him this buſineſs. He hearkens after ſupplications; and looks that men ſhould ply him hard. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and his maker,</hi> Iſa. 45.11. <hi>Ask of me things to come concerning my Sons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you me. q. d.</hi> There are great things to come that I am doing for my Church; what is the reaſon that ye are ſo ſtil, and that I hear of no
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:46169:234"/>
Petitions from you touching theſe things? You are alwayes plying me for preſent things, but I delight to hear you pleading with me for thoſe glorious things to come, which I will ſurely do for my people. Come put in your Petitions and requeſts concerning them, and I will ſtoop ſo low to be commanded by your prayers. <hi>Ask of me things to come, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider in the ſecond place, to quicken you in prayer, that this is ſuch a buſineſs as is worth your earneſtneſs; aſſure your ſelves you cannot lay out too much heat and zeal upon it. When once the Lord hath gathered in a people to him over all the world, the Church ſhall have perfection of beauty. It is a very high expreſſion, but you ſhall ſee it is applied to <hi>Sion, Pſal.</hi> 50.2. And it is meant apparently (my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tren,) of the Goſpel <hi>Sion,</hi> of the Goſpel Church; for in the following parcell of the Pſalm, the Lord rejecteth Jewiſh worſhip. Indeed the Churches happineſs ſhall be ſo great in thoſe dayes, that it is called heaven very often in the Scripture. And ſo the Saints who are to be the Members of that Church, are ſaid to dwell in heaven, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 13.6. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed my brethren, it ſhall be heaven upon earth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider that the bringing in of people over all the world to Chriſt, will be an extraordinary honour to him: the enlargement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the enlargement of his glory. It adds exceedingly you know, my brethren, to the Luſter of a Kingdom, when it hath many people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and when the territories of it are amplified and enlarged. Its no ſuch glory my beloved, to be the King but of a little City or a little Iſland or of a ſmall and inconſiderable company of men. But to be the King of many Nations, and of many Kingdoms, to have a multitude of people in ſubjection, this is a glorious thing indeed. In this reſpect the Empire of Chriſt Jeſus in the latter times ſhall be unparalleld, when once the Jews come in and bring the fulneſs of the Gentiles with them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of love to Jeſus Chriſt, and regard to his glory, we ſhould be intent upon it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider that the bringing in of people over all the world to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, will be very beneficial and advantagious to our ſelves. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we do not apprehend it to be ſo: this Countrey is come in already to the profeſſion of the Goſpel, we are come in already, and what need we care ſo much for other Nations, and for other people? We are well enough our ſelves, and why ſhould we look after others? Yes, my beloved, we have reaſon to look after others: for till all others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Chriſt of all the Nations of the world be gathered in, we are not in ſo good a caſe as we ſhall be afterwards; We are in Chriſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, and that is well for us indeed; but others of his people by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of many other Countreyes, are as yet without: and we <hi>without them cannot be made perfect,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews, Heb. 11. ult. We without them are members in a ſence of an imperfect body. We without them have but imperfect grace, nay though we were in heaven already, we could have but imperfect glory. Till all that appertain to Chriſt be gathered in of all Nations, ſo long as there is but a man without, there can be no day of judgement, and ſo no full reward, no complement of our
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:46169:234"/>
beatitude. And therefore we have reaſon to help on this glorious work to the utmoſt of our power, becauſe till it be accompliſhed, it cannot be ſo well with us as it will be afterwards; <hi>we without them cannot be made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Ieſus Chriſt ſends forth his Miniſters to gather Churches, and to erect his Kingdom over all the world? Here then is matter of rejoycing and thankſgiving for us, the once rejected and neglected peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Gentiles. There was a time my brethren, when we were ſet without the verge, the reach of mercy; When the poor Gentiles liv'd, and we too liv'd without God, without Chriſt, without a promiſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Goſpel; when Chriſt did never ſend to them, to invite them to come in, and when he had no Scepter but in <hi>Jewry,</hi> no ſubjects (in a manner) but among that people. Alas my brethren, Chriſt was a King in thoſe dayes, to break the Gentiles by his power, but he was not a King to rule them by his grace. But now, my brethren, in theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel dayes, there is no ſuch reſpect of perſons with him, as the Apoſtle ſhews, Acts 10.34. <hi>In every Nation, and in every people he hath or ſhall have ſome to ſerve him, and to be accepted with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore whereas formerly, he ſent his meſſengers to none but to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">V;ſe </seg>3</label> the people of the Jewiſh Nation, and gave them an expreſs Injunction, <hi>Goe not into the way of the Gentiles:</hi> In which reſpect it was that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſcrupulous to preach the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius:</hi> Now he ſends forth his Miniſters to all the world to all Nations: now he enlargeth their Commiſſion, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> So that we Gentiles are included in it. All Countreys, People, Callings, Nations, are alike to Chriſt in this reſpect; the publication of the Goſpel and the tender of Salvation, belongeth to them all alike, and if they entertain it and embrace it, whether they be Jews or Gentiles: whether they be Males or Females, whether they be bond or free, they ſhall have ſalvation by him.</p>
                  <p>How great a cauſe have we my brethren, that are Gentiles, of rejoycing and thankſgiving, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould ſend to us, that the word is come to us as it is to all the world, that we ſhould have the Goſpel pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and revealed to us! That we, who formerly were utterly ſhut out from the enjoyment of the means of our ſalvation, ſhould have as full and free a title to them now, as the very Iews themſelves. Nay that we ſhould have the preferment of the Jew, in that by the abundant bleſſing of the Lord upon the means, the Churches of the Gentiles (which were wholly deſolate and barren heretofore) ſhould be more fruitfull, and have more encreaſe of children then ſhe that ſometimes had an husband. Oh let us magnifie the grace of Ieſus Chriſt, let us adore the infiniteneſs of his mercy that he hath caſt us on theſe happy times, wherein he takes ſuch care of poor Gentiles, wherein he ſends to them, and wherein he looks after them as if they were ſome rich purchaſe. Ah, my beloved, did we follow this mercy as far as we could reach it in our thoughts, we ſhould at length (finding no end or bottom in it) cry out with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Oh the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and goodneſs of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE 3.</hi> There is a great ſimilitude between the Fathers ſending Chriſt into the world, and Chriſts ſending his Apoſtles and Miniſters into the world.</head>
                  <p>THis is apparently ſuggeſted here in the particle <hi>as,</hi> and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>alſo. As thou haſt ſent me into the world, even ſo have I alſo ſent them into the world.</hi> My ſending them is much like thy ſending me. So he compares them each with other in another place, almoſt in the ſame words, Iohn 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> The thing is plain enough, that ſo it was in ſome reſpects.</p>
                  <p>But wherein, and in what reſpects this likeneſs ſtood, will need to be explained with much Caution. Becauſe as there was great likeneſs between the Fathers ſending Chriſt, and Chriſts ſending his Apoſtles and Miniſters into the world, ſo there was a great unlikeneſs too. As the ſimilitude was great, ſo certainly the diſſimilitude was great too. And therefore while I ſhew the likneſs, I will ſhew you the unlikeneſs, both of them at one veiw, That you may ſee the one the better for the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As God the Father ſent the Son with authority and power, ſo Jeſus Chriſt ſends his Apoſtles and Miniſters with authority and power too: as God gives him power, ſo he gives them power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. he adds immediately in the very next words, <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations and baptize them. q. d.</hi> becauſe I have received ſuch ample power my ſelf, therefore I give you this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, by which I put a part of this authority and power on you; Go forth and exerciſe it over all the world. And this is that which the Apoſtle calls the power which Chriſt hath given him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. To intimate that he received his power and his authority by way of delegation from the Lord Chriſt, as Chriſt received his power and his authority (as he is man and Mediator) by way of delegation from the Father; and as the Father gives the Son a Key of power, as you may ſee in that remarkable place, Iſa. 22.22. <hi>The Key of the houſe of</hi> David <hi>will I lay upon his ſhoulder,</hi> (that is, upon the ſhoulder of <hi>Eliakim</hi> who was in that reſpect a figure and a Type of Chriſt,) <hi>and he ſhall open and none ſhall ſhut, and he ſhall ſhut and none ſhall open:</hi> ſo Chriſt gives Keyes of power to his Apoſtles and his Miniſters, as you may ſee exemplified in <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16.19. <hi>I will give thee</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>the Keyes of the Kingdom of heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven, viz.</hi> either in the preaching of the word, or in the regular adminiſtration of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="425" facs="tcp:46169:235"/>Here is a great Similitude you ſee between the power with which the Father ſendeth Chriſt, and the power with which Chriſt ſendeth his Apoſtles and his Miniſters into the world. As Chriſt hath power to ſhut and open from the Father, ſo have they from Jeſus Chriſt; as Chriſt hath power to bind and looſe from God the Father, ſo have they from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. As Chriſt hath power to remit ſins, and to retain them from the Father, ſo have they from Chriſt; and therefore having ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> he adds immediately in the next verſe ſave one, <hi>Whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted,</hi> and <hi>whoſeſoever ſins ye retain they are retained.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet as the ſimilitude is great in this reſpect, ſo is the diſſimilitude: The power which Jeſus Chriſt received from God the Father, is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal power. <hi>All power is given to me,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>both in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.19. And in another place, he minds his Father, <hi>That he had given him power over all fleſh,</hi> Joh. 17.2. But now that power which the Apoſtles and the Miniſters of Chriſt received from him, is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular and more confined. Jeſus Chriſt hath all power, all ſorts and all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of power; they have but ſome power, ſome ſorts, and ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The power which Jeſus Chriſt receives from God the Father, is a Kingly power; he <hi>ſets him up as King upon his holy hill of Sion;</hi> and ſo accordingly he crowns him: The power which they receive from Chriſt, is but a Miniſterial power. Chriſt hath a Legiſlative power to make laws, while they have but a Legiſ-narrative or Declaratory power to publiſh laws: Chriſt doth <hi>jus dare,</hi> and they do but <hi>jus dicere:</hi> Chriſt binds and looſes, ſhuts and opens, remitteth and retaineth ſins, authoritatively as a Soveraign Lord; they do it but declaratively as his Miniſters and ſervants.</p>
                  <p>There is a great ſimilitude between the Fathers ſending Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> regard of qualification: as Chriſt receives an unction from the Father to his Office, ſo they received an unction from the Son to their Office; as Chriſt is qualified with the Spirit, ſo are they: Let us compare them each with other, and we ſhall ſee it very clear: The Prophet ſpeaking in the Perſon of our Saviour, ſaith, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, he hath anointed me to preach,</hi> Iſa. 61.1. And ſo accordingly when he firſt began to preach, he took this very Text to preach upon, as you may ſee, Luk. 4.18. <hi>Behold my ſervant</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>whom I uphold,</hi> Iſa. 42.1. <hi>and mine Elect in whom my ſoul delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon him,</hi> and that to qualifie him for his Office, as is apparent in the following words; for it is added preſently, <hi>That he ſhall bring forth judgement to the Gentiles. A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break,</hi> &amp;c. And this is that which is ſuggeſted in the Propheſie, Iſa. 11.2. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him,</hi> and it ſhall reſt upon him in thoſe graces and endowments that fit him for the places to which he is deſigned. And hence it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately annexed, The Spirit of wiſdom and of underſtanding, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of counſel and of might, the ſpirit of knowledge, and the fear of the Lord. So then you ſee the Father as he ſends Chriſt, ſo he endues him with the Spirit, to fit him for the buſineſs that he ſends him in.</p>

                     <pb n="426" facs="tcp:46169:236"/>But doth our Saviour ſo with his Apoſtles and his Miniſters? yes, my Beloved, juſt ſo: he qualifies them with the Spirit too: and therefore having ſaid to his Apoſtles and his Meſſengers, Joh. 20.22. <hi>As my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you.</hi> The very next words are, <hi>And when he had ſaid thus, he breathed on them, and ſaid unto them, receive the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And ſo accordingly the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them abundantly to fill them and enable them for their Miniſterial Office, even as they were about to go abroad and preach. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Here is a greater ſimilitude you ſee, between the Fathers ſending Chriſt into the world, and Chriſts ſending his Apoſtles and Miniſters into the world, in regard of qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>But yet as the ſimilitude is great, ſo is the diſſimilitude in this too. The unction which the Miniſters of Chriſt received from him, though it be like the unction which Chriſt himſelf receiveth from the Father in the thing, yet it is nothing like it in the meaſure and degree. Though they be both the unction of the Spirit, Chriſts is ſurpaſſingly, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beyond theirs; He is endowed with all the graces of the Spirit of every ſort, and every kind, ſo that not one of them is wanting in him: And therefore it is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>that in him all fulneſs dwells;</hi> that is, the fulneſs of all graces whatſoever. But now, my Brethren, in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt it is not ſo, in them there is a diviſion of graces (though not of the graces of Sanctification) yet of the graces of Edification, and one is made partaker of a gift which another hath not. There are diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of gifts, ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 12. <hi>to one is given by the Spirit the word of knowledge, to another propheſie,</hi> &amp;c. But all theſe concur and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And as our Saviour is qualified by the Father, with all kinds and ſorts of graces, ſo with all meaſures and degrees; As he hath all graces in him, ſo each of them is raiſed and intended to the higheſt meaſure, ſo that there can be nothing added to it, to make it more compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Indeed, my Brethren, he received not the Spirit by meaſure from the Father, as the Evangeliſt obſerves, <hi>John</hi> 4.32. but beyond all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But now the Miniſters of Chriſt receive from him but a meaſure of grace, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. So much as he ſees fit to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them for the work that he imploys them in, as you may ſee, Eph. 4.8. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he gave gifts unto men, for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and for the edifying of the body of it.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> There is a great ſimilitude between the Fathers ſending Chriſt into the world, and Chriſts ſending his Apoſtles and Miniſters into the world, in relation to the Errand that both of them are ſent in. Chriſt ſends his Miniſters into the world, upon the very ſame errand that the Father ſent him into the world. For mark it, why did God the Father ſend Chriſt into the world? Truly my Brethren, to be his ſpokeſman unto the world, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>God who in times paſt ſpoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days, ſpoken to us by his Son;</hi> To preach the Goſpel to the world: <hi>He hath anointed me to preach,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. To preach what? <hi>to preach the Goſpel to the poor, to heal the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:46169:236"/>
broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the Captives,</hi> &amp;c. And why did Chriſt ſend his Apoſtles and Miniſters into the world? Why to preach the Goſpel too. That is the ſum of their Commiſſion, Mar. 16.15. <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature.</hi> The Miniſters of Chriſt are ſeparated to the Goſpel, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. They muſt preach all Goſpel, or elſe all for Goſpel ends. They muſt preach Law with Goſpel purpoſes, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical intentions. So that the Father ſends the Son, and the Son ſends his Apoſtles and Miniſters upon very the ſame errand; here the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is very great.</p>
                  <p>But then the diſſimilitude is very great too, in that the Son whom God the Father ſends, is tranſcendently above the Miniſters whom Chriſt ſends, in the very ſame buſineſs; both are Apoſtles, but Chriſt is the chief Apoſtle; both are Preachers of the Goſpel, but Chriſt is the chief Preacher: He preaches it with ſuch authority as they are not inveſted with, and with ſuch efficacy too, as they can never reach to; He preaches by the Spirit to the heart and to the inward man; and ſo he doth it with infallible ſucceſs: They can preach only to the ear, and to the outward man, and hence they often fail of the deſired iſſue: they ſpend their ſtrength in vain, as the Prophet once complained. Indeed the efficacy of their preaching dependeth wholly on the work and power of Chriſt. So that you ſee he is tranſcendently above them in the ſame buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>And then beſides, Jeſus Chriſt is ſent on buſineſs which they are not to touch with. He is ſent about the work of mans Redemption, of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the juſtice of his Father, by his bitter death and paſſion, which is too heavy and too hard for any Man or Angel to go through with, or to have a hand in.</p>
                  <p>There is a great ſimilitude between the Fathers ſending, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to the end that both of them are ſent for. Chriſt ſends his Miniſters into the world, for the very ſame end that God the Father ſent him. For why did God the Father ſend his Son into the world? To ſave his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.21. In which reſpect his Father would not have him called <hi>Apollyon,</hi> a deſtroyer, but Jeſus a Saviour. It's true, that Chriſt is ſet and appointed by his Father, for the fall and riſing again of many: As for the riſing of believers, ſo for the fall of unbelievers. But this is but by accident, and beſides the main intention of God in ſending, and Chriſt in coming. He doth not cauſe the fall of ſuch as periſh, ſo properly and ſo directly, as the riſing of ſuch are ſaved by him. Indeed he <hi>came into world to ſave ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim, 1.15. not to deſtroy ſinners. It's true, that ſinners are deſtroyed by him, but this was not the proper end of his coming. <hi>God did not ſend his Son to condemn the world, but to ſave the world,</hi> Joh. 3.17. And ſo our Saviour Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf profeſſeth, Joh. 12.47. <hi>I came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world.</hi> Even ſo he ſent his Miniſters for the very ſame end, to work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him in the Converſion and the Salvation of his people, <hi>by the fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.21. To ſave themſelves and thoſe that hear them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. Here the Similitude again is great, between the Fathers ſending
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:46169:237"/>
Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in relation to the end that both of them are ſent for.</p>
                  <p>But then the diſſimilitude is great too, In that the Father ſends the Son to ſave his people by his merit and his Spirit. The Son ſends his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to ſave them by the application of his merit and his Spirit to them in the preaching of the Goſpel: The Father ſends the Son to ſave them by dying for them; the Son ſends his Miniſters to ſave them by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, and ſo by crucifying Chriſt again before their eyes, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. The Father ſends his Son to ſave his people meritoriouſly, and by way of effectual operation: The Son ſends his Miniſters to ſave them Miniſterially, and by way of vocal Declaration; ſo that Chriſt only is the proper Saviour, and Miniſters at moſt are but the Inſtrumental Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours of his people.</p>

As God inveſted him with power, and ſent him into the world to preach the Goſpel, and to ſave his people: So Jeſus Chriſt hath inveſted them with power to do the ſame thing, for the ſame end; So that they muſt not aim at the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and the hardning of the people; No, they muſt make this their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, how they may bring about their converſion and ſalvation. It's true, they muſt be ſons of Thunder now and then, as well as ſons of Conſolation; they muſt preach the Law ſometimes, as well as the ſweet comforts of the Goſpel; they muſt threaten men ſometimes with wrath, and hell, and eternal condemnation: But then they muſt not do it ſo as wiſhing that theſe things might come upon them, but rather that they might avoid them. They muſt threaten them with wrath, that they may <hi>flee from the wrath to come;</hi> and threaten with hell, that they may eſcape the damnation of hell; they muſt preach the Law with Goſpel purpoſes and Evangelical intentions; they muſt ſend out the avenger of blood to dog them at the heels, that they may fly to the City of refuge: They muſt uſe ſharpneſs now and then, it cannot be avoided; But it muſt be for the ſame end that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. where having minded the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that in caſe he <hi>muſt uſe ſharpneſs, according to the power the Lord had given him,</hi> he had authority from Chriſt to do it; but mark in the ſucceeding words to what end; <hi>for edification, and not for deſtruction; according to the power the Lord hath given me for edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for deſtruction:</hi> And therefore it is very notable, that when our Saviour Chriſt had ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>All power is given to me both in heaven and in earth:</hi> and having put a part of that power and authority of his on his Apoſtles, having ſent them as his Father ſent him, he doth not ſay to them as God doth to the Prophet, Jer. 1.10. <hi>I have ſet you over the Nations, and over the Kingdoms, to root out and to deſtroy;</hi> but I have ſent you to the Nations to teach them, and to baptize them, that they may be ſaved: He doth not make them rooters, but planters; he doth not bid them to go out, and preach damnation to the people in the firſt place; but go and preach the Goſpel to them, that they may be ſaved.</p>

                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:46169:237"/>And the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the execution of this Commiſſion, and authority in the Adminiſtration of the cenſures of the Church, ſaith, he would give a foul offendor up to Satan, for no other end but this, even for his good, and his ſalvation, 1 Cor. 5.34. <hi>I have already judged,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>concerning him that hath ſo done this deed, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver him to Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi> the carnal part, <hi>that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord:</hi> So that when we threaten judgement, when we retain the ſins of men, when we give them up to Satan either in preaching or in Church-cenſure, our aim is, that their corruption may be mortified, and that their ſpirits may be ſaved by this means: And all the Miniſters of Chriſt ought to have this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in their eye, how they may reach this great end; they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſent them, as God the Father ſent him, and that was <hi>not to condemn the world, but that the world by him might be ſaved.</hi>

               <p>Two things we have apparently preſented to us in the words; what our Saviour did, and why he did it.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="430" facs="tcp:46169:238"/>The difficulty of the text lies eſpecially in this, how Chriſt is ſaid to ſanctifie himſelf, and what he means by that expreſsion, <hi>for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf.</hi> To ſanctifie, is properly to make holy; now a perſon or a thing is made holy eſpecially two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi> by qualification, when holineſs and grace is put into it, when a man is made partaker of the ſaving gifts and graces of the holy ſpirit, then he is ſaid in Scripture to be ſanctified; By conſecration a perſon or a thing is made holy, when it is ſet apart for holy uſes. In this reſpect the Sabbath day is holy, in this reſpect the Temple, the Utenſils and Veſſels of the houſe of God, in this reſpect the Prieſts were holy. Thus all the firſt born of the Jews were holy, and ſet apart for God. And therefore having charged <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſanctifie the firſt born, thus he explains it afterwards; <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2, 12. <hi>Thou ſhalt ſet them apart to God:</hi> and in a word, thus all the Sacrifices and oblations under the Ceremonial Law, were holy, they were conſecrated things; For conſecrated things are ſanctified things, as I might give you inſtances enough in that particular. <hi>Thou ſhalt annoint them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, ſpeaking of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons, Exod. 28.4. <hi>and thou ſhalt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and ſanctifie them that they may Miniſter unto me in the Prieſts office.</hi> So after ſpeaking of the Ramm of conſecration, <hi>Aaron and his Sons ſhall eat it,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>to conſecrate them and to ſanctifie them,</hi> Exod. 29.33. Now all the queſtion is, in which of theſe reſpects, our Saviour here is ſaid to ſanctifie himſelf, whether by way of qualification, or of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.</p>
               <p>I muſt acknowledge, I have heretofore conceived it in the former way, as in a way of qualification, that he made himſelf holy, by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the gifts and graces of the holy ſpirit, to his humane nature. For though it be a certain truth, that Chriſt was not, neither could be made holy of not holy privatively, as man who by the fall had wholly loſt his holineſs, is ſanctified and made holy by regeneration, and the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt; Yet it is very manifeſt, that Chriſt was ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and made holy of not holy negatively; for there was once a time when Chriſt as man had not this holineſs inherent in his humane nature, becauſe there was a time, <hi>viz.</hi> before his incarnation, when his humane nature had not a being in the world. And thus Chriſt was ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for his Apoſtles and Diſciples ſake, his peoples ſake; <hi>That they might be ſanctified,</hi> That is, he was endued abundantly with the gifts of holineſs and the graces of ſanctification to this end, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them and diſpenſe them to his people, and that they might be ſanctified by this means, <hi>That of his fulneſs they might all receive, and grace for grace.</hi> So that this looks extreamly well you ſee, as the meaning of the Text. <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet I find interpreters even univerſally running in another ſtream, and underſtanding it of being ſanctified in a way of conſecration. The former I ſuppoſe they leave, becauſe indeed it is not conſonant to Scripture phraſe; For Jeſus Chriſt to ſay (as man) that he ſanctified himſelf in a way of qualification, That is to ſay, that he endued himſelf
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:46169:238"/>
with the ſanctifying gifts and graces of the holy ſpirit. It is uſually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that God the Father ſanctified him, <hi>That it pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all the fulneſs of the holy ſpirit dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. <hi>That God, even his God, did annoint him with the oyl of his ſpirit,</hi> Pſal. 45.7. And therefore he is called <hi>him whom the Father ſanctified and ſent into the world,</hi> John 10.36.</p>
               <p>Beſides it ſeems not to be congruous that Chriſt ſhould pray his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſanctifie his Apoſtles and Diſciples, becauſe for his part he had ſanctified himſelf with the graces of the ſpirit, to this end, <hi>that they might be ſanctified</hi> by communication of thoſe graces to them.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſhall run down with the common ſtream of expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and underſtand our Saviour here to tell his Father that he ſanctified himſelf by way of Conſecration; That he ſet himſelf apart to be a Prieſt, an Altar, an Offring, and a Sacrifice to God the Father, for the ſins of his people. And that to this end, <hi>that they might be ſanctified</hi> by this means. Not only that they might be juſtified, but that they might be ſanctified too. And ſanctified through the truth, through the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual revelation of the Goſpel to them, which is called <hi>the truth</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; Or <hi>truly ſanctified,</hi> as it is rendred in the Margine; not only in the Type and Figure (as the Offrings and Sacrifices of the Ceremonial Law) but in reality and truth.</p>
               <p>And on this ground, our Saviour prayes his Father, to ſanctifie his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that he might not be diſappointed of his great end for which he ſanctified himſelf, and made himſelf an offring to his Father; <hi>Sanctifie them with the truth.</hi> And why ſo? Why, <hi>for their ſakes I ſanctifice my ſelf,</hi> I ſet my ſelf apart to be a Sacrifice to thy juſtice, <hi>that they alſo might be ſanctified with the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The words thus opened yield us out two Obſervations. Firſt, Jeſus Chriſt did willingly and freely ſet himſelf apart to be an Offring and a Sacrifice to God the Father. Secondly, he did this for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſakes, and that to this end, that they might be ſanctified, by this means.</p>

                  <p>He was not forced to become an Expiation for the ſins of men. No he did it of himſelf; and of his own accord, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf</hi> (ſaith our Saviour in my text) by conſecration.</p>
                  <p>So he is ſaid to offer up himſelf, Heb. 7.27. <hi>To humble himſelf and to become obedient</hi> (conceive it paſsively obedient) <hi>to the death, even the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.8. Tis true indeed the death and paſſion of our Saviour was neceſſary if we look to God the Father, and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel and Decree; <hi>for he was ſlain</hi> in that reſpect, <hi>i. e.</hi> appointed to be ſlain <hi>from the beginning of the world.</hi> It was <hi>determined</hi> to be done, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28.

as himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.46. and he muſt be <hi>lifted up</hi> upon the Croſs; an unavoidable neceſsity was laid upon him, <hi>John</hi> 3.14. And as his death was neceſſary if we look to God the Father, ſo it was violent (my Brethren) if we look to men. With murderous and wicked hands they ſlew him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. <hi>They kild and crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> But if we look to Chriſt himſelf, his death and paſsion was a voluntary thing, to which he willingly reſigned and yielded up himſelf. His life was not extorted from him, but he laid it <hi>down</hi> himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 10.17. He was delivered up to death by God the Father, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. He was delivered up by <hi>Judas</hi> and the Jews too, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.2. And yet he freely yielded up himſelf; <hi>he loved us and gave himſelf for us,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>he gave himſelf for us an Offring and a ſacrifice to God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.2. He ſanctified himſelf for our ſakes, and ſet himſelf apart to this hard and ſharp ſervice, ſo that the Point is plain you ſee, That Jeſus Chriſt did willingly and freely ſet himſelf apart to be a Offring and a Sacrifice to God the Father.</p>

A man is never forced to any thing againſt his will, unleſs ſome outward violence prevail againſt him which he is no way able to reſiſt. Now this was not the ſtate and the condition of our Saviour; his death was not inflicted on him by an exceſs of ſtrength in thoſe that gave him up to it. His Father was not able to conſtrain him, for he was God: and therefore equally Almighty with the Father. And men had infinitely leſs ability to overrule him, and to force him to it, and therefore it muſt needs be voluntary of himſelf, and this he cleerly intimateth in that ſpeech of his in the fore-alledged Scripture, John 10.17. <hi>No man takes my life from me;</hi> the meaning is, no man can take my life from me, and therefore it is added in the following words, <hi>I have power to lay it down,</hi> that is, to lay it down of choice and free election, ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſtrained to it, <hi>and I have power to take it up again.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he had power to take it up again when he had loſt it, then he had much more power to keep it when he had it and enjoyed it.

Had his life been taken from him for our ſakes, this had been no great love, but that himſelf ſhould lay it down freely of his own accord, here was love, and here was mercy to be ſpoken of, and to be wondred at in all ages.

Then let us learn of him (my brethren) as willingly (if it be poſſible) to offer up our ſelves, our perſons, our eſtates, our names, or lives and all to him, to ſuffer any thing for him again. What my beloved, did he ſuffer willingly for us, and ſhall we ſuffer grudgingly and unwillingly for him? did he conſecrate himſelf to be an offering and ſacrifice for us, and ſhall not we on our parts conſecrate our ſelves to be an offering and ſacrifice for him if he ſhall call us thereunto? did he give himſelf for us, and ſhall not we as readily give our ſelves for him again? did he take up his Croſs and go before, and ſhall not we take up our Croſſes too and follow him? I do not ſay we ſhould draw Croſſes and afflictions on our ſelves; but if they come upon us for our Saviours ſake, we ſhould not take them as inforced upon us, but we ſhould freely ſet our ſhoulders to them and cheerfully ſubmit our ſelves to bear them.

                  <p>He did not do it for his own ſake, for there was no ſin in him, and ſo in that reſpect he need not to be made a Sacrifice for ſin. There was no tranſgreſſion in him, and why then ſhould there be an expiation for him? But it was for his peoples ſake. To ſay the truth, all that he did, all that he ſuffered, was for their ſakes. For their ſakes he became man, for their ſakes he became Mediator between God and man, for their ſakes he became a King, a Prophet and a Prieſt. And as a Prieſt, ſo a ſacrifice and offring to the Father, for <hi>he offered up himſelf.</hi> All was for their ſakes.</p>

ſet himſelf apart to be a Sacrifice to God the Father for his peoples ſakes, <hi>that they alſo might be ſanctified,</hi> as you have it in the Text. <hi>He loved his Church, and</hi> out of the abundance of this love of his <hi>he gave himſelf for her,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. What, that he might redeem and juſtifie her only? No my beloved, more then this; that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe her too through the waſhing of Water by the word, and that he might preſent her to himſelf a glorious Church, not having any ſpot or wrinkle, but being holy and without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. <hi>He bare our ſins in his own body on the Tree, that we being dead to ſin might henceforth live to righteouſneſs,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>he dyed for us, that we which live, ſhould henceforth live no longer to our ſelves,</hi> to our luſts, and to our ends, <hi>but to him who dyed for us.</hi> He hath performed the mercyes promiſed, he hath remembred his holy Covenant, <hi>he hath ſaved us from our enemies, and from the hands of thoſe hate us,</hi> Luke 1.74. What, that from henceforth we might be our own Maſters, and live at liberty and walk according to our own humours? O no, but on the contrary, <hi>that we might ſerve him</hi> who hath ſaved us, <hi>in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs all the dayes of our lives: By one offering</hi> of himſelf, <hi>he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. Not them that are juſtified, but <hi>them that are ſanctified.</hi> And hence the blood of Jeſus which he ſhed when he was a made a ſacrifice to God the Father, hath not a pacifying only but a purging quality in it. It hath not only a value to ſatisfie, but a virtue to ſanctifie. <hi>The blood of Jeſus cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1.7. Compleatly from the guilt of all in juſtification, and inchoatively from the filth of all in ſanctification. I might be copious in the proof, but this may ſatisfie to clear the point. Chriſt did not ſet himſelf apart to be an offring and a ſacrifice to God the Father for his own ſake, but for his peoples ſakes, and that to this end, <hi>that they might be ſanctified by this means.</hi>

For, firſt his ſcope and purpoſe in this work of his, was not only to preſerve his people from deſtruction, but to bring them to ſalvation; not only to deliver them from hell, but to obtain their entrance into heaven. And truly had he not accompliſhed both of theſe, he had not been a perfect Saviour, he had not ſaved us to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. Now my beloved, had he juſtified us only from the guilt of our tranſgreſſions, he had done but one of theſe; for guilt is nothing but the obligation or binding over of the ſinner to damnation; ſo that in quitting us of this, he had but <hi>ſaved us from the wrath to come</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) he had not brought us to the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to come. And therefore ſince he had a further aim, that he might bring his whole intent about, he hath not juſtified us only, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us from death and condemnation, but he hath ſanctified us alſo, and ſo prepared us for life and ſalvation; <hi>For without holineſs it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible to ſee the Lord;</hi> To be admitted as inhabitants into that holy habitation concerning which the holy Ghoſt hath ſaid, <hi>There ſhall no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing enter into it.</hi> Rev 21.27.

                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour ſanctified himſelf to be a Sacrifice for us, not only that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> we might be juſtified, but that we might be ſanctified alſo, becauſe he had a purpoſe and deſign, not to glorifie us only, but to glorifie himſelf in this buſineſs. And more particularly and diſtinctly, to glorifie himſelf in us, and to glorifie himſelf by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was the project and deſign of Chriſt in this great work of his, to glorifie himſelf in us, and therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould not juſtifie us only, but ſanctifie us too: For had he juſtified us only from the guilt of our tranſgreſſions, his glory had appeared indeed upon us, to wit, the glory of his mercy; but which way had his glory ſhewed it ſelf in us? But now by ſanctifying us, and by inriching us with all the ſaving graces of his holy Spirit (which far exeeed the brighteſt and Orient Pearls both in luſtre and in value) his glory ſhineth forth in us. <hi>Now he us glorified in his Saints,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks. The glory of his grace appeareth in them, and ſparkles forth with dazling luſtre. And as in the Creation of the world is ſeen his wiſdom and his power and God-head, and the like: So in the renovation and the new creation of ſome certain perſons in it, is ſeen the riches of his grace. He doth it <hi>that he might make known his glory,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells us, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that he may declare it in the veſſels of his mercy prepared</hi> by him <hi>unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23. And as the greatneſs and magnificence of any Prince is ſeen in the Revenues and the Titles and the Dignities of thoſe whom he hath raiſed and advanced: So in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent gracious priviledges and endowments, preparing us for glory in the world to come, are ſeen the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was the project and deſign of Chriſt in this great work of his to glorifie himſelf by us: And therefore it was neceſſary that he ſhould not juſtifie us only but ſanctifie us too: For had we not been ſanctified, we ſhould have diſhonoured Chriſt in our whole Converſation. But being once regenerated and endowed with ſaving grace, and purified as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people to himſelf, then we glorifie our Saviour; Then we ſhew forth the vertues, and with them the praiſes of him that hath ſaved us. We cauſe <hi>our works to ſhine before men,</hi> and Jeſus Chriſt (who ſtrengthneth us) to ſhine in them.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my Brethren, that Chriſt did not ſet himſelf apart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Take heed you uſe not this incomparable grace and mercy of the Lord Chriſt, as an occaſion to the fleſh, by taking any kind of licence thence to give it ſatisfaction in the luſts thereof. It is a dangerous &amp; deſperate courſe of many men who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending, that they are delivered by the death of Chriſt from all their ſins, and that the Juſtice of the Lord is ſatified and appeaſed for them, are by this means imboldned and encouraged on in their evill ways. And when they are reproved for their licentious courſes, they ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:46169:241"/>
with this, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for them; and that not only for their paſt and preſent ſins, but for their ſins to come alſo; ſo that they need not be afraid to act them, nor to be humbled for them, after they have done them. But I muſt tell them, Chriſt hath not ſatisfied for them, if he do not ſanctifie them. He hath not ſet himſelf apart to to be a ſacrifice for them, if he do not ſet them apart to be a holy and peculiar people to himſelf. And unto ſuch as turn this grace into licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, I ſay as <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſometime to <hi>Iſrael, Do ye thus requite the Lord O fooliſh people and unwiſe!</hi> Oh Helliſh people and prophane! yea I proteſt againſt them, in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. that Jeſus Chriſt ſhall profit them nothing.</p>

Ah my Beloved, were there nothing in the world but this alone, to quicken us and egge us on to purity and a holy converſation; no peace of conſcience waiting on it, no inward joy and comfort of the Holy Ghoſt, no fruit of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no reward of it, neither in the preſent life, nor in that which is to come (whereas it hath the promiſes of both) I ſay my Brethren, were there nothing elſe to move us, this of it ſelf were ſufficient to perſwade, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt in all thoſe torments, thoſe abaſures, thoſe agonies and horrors which he ſuffered, when he ſanctified himſelf and ſet himſelf apart to be a ſacrifice to God the Father, aimed at this, <hi>that he might ſanctifie us to himſelf:</hi> that we for whom he ſuffered might be holy. And ſhall we now like baſe unthankful and unworthy wretches, endeavour to the utmoſt of our power, to thwart and croſs him in his purpoſe, to fruſtrate and make void his end? Hath he laid down his life to this end, that we might be pure, and ſhall we notwithſtanding be prophane? Hath he ſhed his pretious blood to this end that we might be holy, and ſhall we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be unclean? Is this the reckoning that we make of all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite and thoſe unutterable pangs and tortures which our Saviour ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, when not his body only, but his ſoul was made an offering for ſin, that we regard not, though he ſuffer them in vain? I ſay to you my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as the Church, Lament. 1.12. <hi>Is it nothing to you all ye that paſs by?</hi> Shall all thoſe wounds, thoſe ſtripes, thoſe horrors he endured, thoſe ſtreams of pretious blood be ſhed in vain?</p>
                  <p>Oh think upon it you that rot away in your corruptions, and that by weltring in the goar of your abominable ſins: and though you have been frequently adviſed &amp; intreated &amp; beſought to waſh you, and to make you clean, yet are reſolved to be filthy ſtill: For you make the Son of God (as much as in you lies) to ſuffer &amp; to die in vain: you ſpill this pretious blood and tread it under foot: And be aſſured of this, your ſin is infinitely great, and your damnation will be heavy in the world to come. And therefore as King <hi>David</hi> once when his three Worthies had adventured to fetch him water from the Well of <hi>Bethel,</hi> with the apparent and extreameſt hazard of their lives, refuſed utterly to drink it, or to taſte of it: <hi>Be it far from me</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for is not this the blood of theſe men?</hi> 2 Sam. 23.17.

Me thinks, the thought of this ſhould even break their hearts amidſt their greateſt earthly pleaſures and contentments: For what do they imagine, that Chriſt will fail of his intention, or that he will attain but half his purpoſe? That ſince he ſanctified himſelf to be a ſacrifice to God the Father for his people, <hi>that they might be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> he will ever juſtifie and ſave them whom he never ſanctifieth? That he will fall ſhort of that which was his ſcope and aim in this buſineſs. Oh fooliſh fancie and abſurd imagination! Nay Jeſus Chriſt himſelf hath ſaid, yea he hath ſworn the contrary; and if you will not take his word, I hope you will believe his Oath: This the is oath that he hath ſworn, that all they that are ſaved by him from the guilt and from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all their ſins, ſhall ſerve him too in holineſs: So that if any filthy and unſanctified perſon ſhould be ſaved, Jeſus Chriſt muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn, which were blaſphemous to imagine.</p>
                  <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched the firſt part of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours prayer for the Church; and are arrived at the Second. In the firſt place he prays, as I have ſhewed you, for his Apoſtles and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples then about him, the members of the Church that then was, who were already called and ſanctified, whom God had given him out of the world: <hi>I pray for them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I pray not for the world;</hi> and this part of the prayer he ſhuts up with the verſe which we have even now ended.</p>
                  <p>And now my Brethren, in the ſecond place, he comes to pray for thoſe who were after to be called by their preaching, or their writing, who were to be the members of the Church that was to come; <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo that ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi> And here we have in general theſe two main things to be conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts deſcription of the perſons for whom he now becomes a Suitor to his Father, <hi>them which ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The matter of the prayer which he makes for theſe perſons, <hi>That they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee,</hi> and ſo on.</p>
                  <p>At this time we ſhall enter on the firſt of theſe, and that is Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the perſons for whom he now becomes a ſuitor to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and they in general are true believers, who are deſcribed three ways. Firſt, by the time of their faith; they are not ſuch as did believe when Chriſt put up his Supplication to his Father, but ſuch as ſhould believe in after-times. Secondly, by the object of their Faith, they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Jeſus Chriſt. Thirdly, by the inſtrumental means of this faith; they ſhould believe in Chriſt through the Apoſtles word.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak a word or two of the circumſtance of time by which our
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:46169:242"/>
Saviour here deſcribeth thoſe for whom he prays; they are not ſuch as did believe, when Chriſt put up this ſupplication to his Father; but ſuch as ſhould believe in after-times; <hi>Neither pray I for theſe only,</hi> for my Apoſtles and Diſciples who believe in me already, <hi>but for them alſo who ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on me through their word.</hi> So that you ſee,</p>

                  <p>It reaches to believers by Election, to all that are appointed to believe to the end of the world; <hi>I pray,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>for them alſo</hi> (for all them) <hi>which ſhall believe on me, through their word.</hi> And as God loves believers by Election, though for the preſent they be unbelievers, (as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you very lately) ſo Chriſt prays for all ſuch. Indeed he died for all ſuch, for all ſuch as ſhall believe (and not for ſuch alone as do believe) and therefore he muſt needs pray for all ſuch: For both the branches of his Prieſthood muſt of neceſſity be co-extended: and ſo for whomſoever he is a Prieſt to ſacrifice, for them alſo he is a Prieſt to intercede: as he hath offered up himſelf for them, ſo he hath offered up his prayers for them, and will do to the worlds end.</p>

While we are asking ſuch a child, or ſuch a friend, of God, it may be Chriſt is asking him or her of God too, according to the Covenant of the Father with the Son, <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee.</hi> And therefore let us not grow cold or faint in ſuch a ſuit as this is, but let us follow and purſue it to the utmoſt: Let us not ceaſe to pray for ſuch a perſon, let us not caſt him out of our prayers, whom Jeſus Chriſt hath not caſt out of his; <hi>I pray,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for ſuch as ſhall believe;</hi>

and this for ought we know, may be one of that number.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the firſt particular, by which our Saviour Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth thoſe for whom he prays, <hi>viz.</hi> the time of their believing. They are not ſuch as did believe when Chriſt put up this ſupplication for them to the Father, but ſuch as ſhould believe in after-times.</p>
                  <p>Proceed we to the ſecond thing by which he ſets them forth, and that is, by the Spirit of this faith of theirs, they ſhould believe in Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone,</hi> ſaith Chriſt here, <hi>but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me:</hi> He doth not ſay, for them which ſhall believe on God, or for them which ſhall believe the Word of God, <hi>but for them which ſhall believe on me;</hi> ſo that the point to be obſerved is this.</p>

The Law will never juſtifie us, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us: No, <hi>we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt</hi> and him alone who is revealed and manifeſted to us in the Goſpel: The Rightouſneſs of God, that is the righteouſneſs which makes us righteous; the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of man will never do it; No, it muſt be the righteouſneſs of God himſelf, <hi>This is ours by faith in Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſhews, Rom. 3.22. <hi>He that believeth in the Son hath life,</hi> Joh. 3. <hi>ult.</hi> Obſerve it well, he ſaith not in the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt, though certainly we muſt believe in both theſe; But Chriſt is the immediate object of the faith which juſtifieth, or of it as it juſtifieth. <hi>He that believeth in the Son hath life,</hi> the life of holineſs, and the life of righteouſneſs, for both of them are very clearly meant in that place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay perhaps, <hi>Is not the Word of God, and is not God himſelf, and is not everlaſting life the object of our faith? how then is Chriſt as I have ſaid, and Chriſt alone the next and the immediate object of it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> To this, becauſe it is compounded as it were of divers things, I muſt anſwer divers ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Word of God, that is not properly the object of the faith that juſtifieth, but is ſo called by a figure, becauſe it holds forth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits Chriſt who is indeed the proper object of this juſtifying faith. Or ſecondly the Word of God, although it may in ſome reſpects be called the object of faith that juſtifieth, yet not <hi>qua juſtificat,</hi> not as it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:46169:243"/>
as the School ſpeaks. It's true, that juſtifying faith believeth other things propounded in the Word of God. But faith as it juſtifieth, lays hold on Chriſt and him only, not knowing any other thing here but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for the ſecond thing propounded in the Querie, True it is that God the Father is the Object of our faith (I mean the faith which juſtifyeth;) but not the next and the immediate Object of it. Chriſt muſt be firſt laid hold upon, and God in Chriſt. <hi>Such truſt have we through Chriſt in God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4. Even Turks and Jews and Arrians boaſt of faith in God you know, amd yet becauſe they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend not Jeſus Chriſt, they miſerably loſe their own ſouls. <hi>He that</hi> denyeth (and ſo by conſequence,) <hi>believes not in the Son, can never have the Father,</hi> as you may ſee, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.23. He is like a man goes about to graſp a thing that is too big for him, a large and ſmooth round-bodyed Cup, it ſlips away out of his fingers, whereas he might have held it by the handle. The faith which juſtifies us, my beloved, apprehendeth Chriſt, receiveth and layeth hold on him, and then as it is added in the fore-alledged Scripture, <hi>He that hath the Son, hath the Father alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for the third particular propounded whether ſalvation and eternal life be the object of our faith. To ſay the truth, ſalvation and eternal life is not ſo properly believed as hoped for. Nor can it be ſo fitly called the object, as the conſequent and end of faith. So the Apoſtle calls it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end,</hi> ſaith he, (Conceive it the perfection, or the reward of your faith) <hi>even the ſalvation of your ſouls.</hi> Salvation then you ſee my brethren, is the end, Chriſt is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> Is Chriſt the Object of a true believers faith? Then do not ſatisfie your ſelves my brethren, with a general aſſent to ſacred Revelation, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do you reſt in this that you believe the word of God in groſs. Alas, how many men that have been throughly convinced of the truth of all the Scripture, are notwithſtanding under everlaſting Chains and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! the Devils themſelves <hi>believe and tremble.</hi> They believe the word (hiſtorically you muſt underſtand it) and becauſe it makes againſt them the greater their faith is, the greater is their fear. As therefore you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be abſolved and acquitted from the guilt of all your ſins which elſe will ſink you down into the pit of Hell for ever, to be inveſted with the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, without which you can never have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the marriage of the Lamb, nor to thoſe joyes and pleaſures at the Lords right hand for evermore, lay hold on Jeſus Chriſt, and claſp the arms of faith about him: Men and brethren, to you is this ſalvation ſent, and we declare unto you glad tydings, preaching through Chriſt the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins: and that by him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not have been juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> We offer and exhibit Chriſt unto you, and we beſeech you to accept him, that you may be ſaved. We ſtand and cry, <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, came to this water.</hi> Now as you tender the ſalvation of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious ſouls, let faith make out to Jeſus Chriſt that comes towards her; let
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:46169:243"/>
her faſten on her object. And that you may the better know what I perſwade you to, I ſhall ſhew you very briefly, that there are four acts of the ſoul in reference to Jeſus Chriſt, wherein the eſſence and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of juſtifying faith conſiſts: Whereof the former two, are of the underſtanding, and the two latter of the will. I ſhall but only touch at them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Well then, the firſt thing you are to do, you muſt endeavour to know Chriſt aright: diſtinct explicite knowledge of him in a meaſure, is neceſſary to the being of this juſtifying faith. And therefore knowledge is ſometimes put for faith in Scripture; <hi>by his knowledge</hi> or the knowledge of himſelf, <hi>ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many,</hi> ſaith the Father of the Son, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. And here to be a little more diſtinct, you muſt know that Chriſt is a compleat and al-ſufficient Saviour to free you from the wrath of God, and to bring you to eternal life; That he is offered by the Lord to you, as well as any other: for ſo the meſſengers of God have their Commiſſion to make an univerſal tender of him to all to whom they preach without exception; <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. And what is it to preach the Goſpel to them, but to ſay as the Angel to the Shepherds, Luke 2.10, 11. <hi>I bring you good tydings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people: for unto you is born this day in the City of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord?</hi> And as <hi>Peter</hi> to the Jews, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your children, yea and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Yea you muſt know that Chriſt is offered to you, ſo that you are perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily commanded and required to believe in him. <hi>Come to me,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>i. e.</hi> Believe in me, (for ſo himſelf expounds the phraſe as you may ſee, John 6.35.) <hi>all you that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> This is the firſt thing requiſite to juſtifying faith, of which Chriſt is the proper Object.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond act is the Aſſent and Credit of the mind to this, that Chriſt is ſuch a one indeed, and that God offers him indeed in ſuch a way as hath been ſaid. And that in this his gracious offer he intendeth as he ſaith: That Chriſt and all his merits will be yours if you accept him. This you muſt conſent to; you muſt ſay with the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithfull ſaying;</hi> and in relation to this act it is that faith is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>believing,</hi> John 3.36. and elſewhere often in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third act is the yeelding of the Will to this external exhibition of the Son of God, this bleſſed offer of him in the Goſpel, not only for the certain truth, but the incomparable excellency of it; when the heart accepteth of it, and embraceth it, and ſaith with the Apoſtle in the fore-alledged Scripture, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This ſaying</hi> as <hi>it is a faithfull one,</hi> ſo <hi>it is worthy of all acceptation. It is a faithfull ſaying,</hi> ſaith the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and therefore I will give aſſent to it: <hi>It is a ſaying worthy of all acceptation,</hi> ſaith the will, and therefore I will cloſe with it. So the faith of the Fathers is deſcribed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13. in which all the three acts which we have mentioned are wrapt up together. They ſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; conceive it with the underſtandings eye, they knew them and they underſtood them. They were perſwaded of them, they gave aſſent to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:46169:244"/>
them, and they received them and embraced them: for both theſe terms are there uſed, not the words and ſurface of them, but Chriſt in them. In which reſpect this act of faith is ſometimes called receiving of Chriſt, as ſee John 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him, &amp;c.</hi> So that believing and receiving are all one; this is the third act.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt act, is a reſting, a relying, and recumbency on Chriſt for mercy and ſalvation: this is the great act of the ſoul in faith: A roling of it ſelf on Jeſus Chriſt, expecting life and happineſs no other way, and by no other mean but him only: And this is that which is ſo often called believing in the Son of God, believing in his name, truſting in him, as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.12. or truſting to him for all the good that we expect or look for. Theſe are the four great acts of faith, and Chriſt you ſee is the immediate and proper object of them all: So that you eaſily perceive what I intend when I perſwade you and exhort you to faſten on this object and to believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay perhaps <hi>(as that is now a great Objection) the Creature is not able to believe: it is an impotent and dead thing: what can the Creature do? And why do you perſwade it to believe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sol.</hi> True my beloved, it can do nothing, and you would have it to do nothing by this Rule. Keep away the means from it, and when will it attain the end? It hath no faith: it is not able to believe: but faith comes by this means, by the perſwaſions and intreaties of the Goſpel: <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. When the Apoſtles perſwaded ſinners to believe, (as that was very uſual with them) might not a man have ſaid to them, What do you ſpeak to them? They cannot do what you perſwade them to; and yet you know what multitudes ſometimes were brought to believe by one Sermon. So that the word is not in vain, though men be dead and unable to believe, becauſe when God is pleaſed to work with it, it quickens them, and begetteth faith in them.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> Is Chriſt the Object of a true believers faith? Are we juſtified by faith as it layes hold on Chriſt, and on the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? This then diſcovers the defect and imperfection of inherent righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This laying hold upon the Lord Jeſus, this going forth out of our ſelves to fetch Righteouſneſs abroad to juſtifie us in the ſight of God, implies an emptineſs and want of it at home. Tis true indeed, had we continued in our firſt integrity, had we remained in that uprighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and perfection which was at firſt beſtowed upon us, there had been then no need at all of juſtifying faith. But when our own inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs was loſt in <hi>Adams</hi> fall, ſo that there was an utter failing of it, an abſolute deficiency in our ſelves, Faith was provided to ſupply us and to furniſh us again, by fetching in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſo that this laying hold upon imputed, apparently implyes the abſence of inherent righteouſneſs; And therefore when we ſhall be raiſed again to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which we once enjoyed in <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency, which ſhall be done you know my brethren, in the other Paradiſe, in heaven, in the ſtate of glory, this juſtifying faith ſhall ceaſe, at leaſt with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the receiving of Jeſus the Lord our Righteouſneſs, becauſe we ſhall have righteouſneſs enough in heaven of our own. And this is that
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:46169:244"/>
which the Apoſtle meaneth in that memorable place, 1 Cor. 13. ult. <hi>And now abideth faith, hope and charity.</hi> Now they abide; conceive it in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life; they all continue; for that is his intention there, but the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of theſe is charity, the chiefeſt in regard of permanency and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe that never faileth as he affirmeth in the eighth verſe of that Chapter, No not in heaven in the ſtate of bleſſedneſs where juſtifying faith and hope ſhall fail, and be taken both away.</p>
                  <p>Is Chriſt the Object of a true believers faith? This then as it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <label type="milestone">

It is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt which we fetch in by faith, and that you know is abſolute and accompliſht righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. And this adminiſters incomparable ſweet and pretious comfort to the Saints, who are ſo far dejected with the ſenſe and feeling of their wants as to conclude they are not juſtified in the ſight of God, they are ſo full of imperfections and defects: Oh they come ſo far ſhort, their graces are ſo ſmall and weak, and their obedience is ſo ſlender, that they reſolve the Lord will not accept and juſtifie ſuch wretched creatures as they are. Indeed my brethren, if our being juſtified and accepted with the Lord, depended on the highth and the perfection of inherent right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, we had cauſe to be diſcouraged: But ſeeing we are juſtified by faith in Chriſt by laying hold on the Lord our righteouſneſs, by fetching in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and not by perfecting our own: if we have taken him, we are <hi>compleat</hi> in him (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) amidſt our many unallowed imperfections and defects; And though we ſhould be humbled for our failings, with refererence to ſanctification, yet we ſhould not doubt our ſelves and our eſtates, with reference to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: for having once received Chriſt by faith we are compleat in him, though imperfect in our ſelves. If all the Righteouſneſs which is in Chriſt will make us righteous, we are righteous; <hi>for he is made to us righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Oh, how ſhould this ſupport their drooping ſpirits, who pine away in endleſs ſorrow for their failings and defects! If they be ſure they have laid hold on Chriſt by faith, they may conclude his righteouſneſs is theirs, and that is perfect though their own be weak and wanting; And though they be diſcouraged in themſelves, they may encourage and cheer up themſelves in Chriſts; And certainly in doing ſo they honour Chriſt, and advance his fulneſs.</p>

                  <p>If faith be wrought in any ſoul, it is by the Apoſtles word, the word of the New Teſtament, not of the Old; Of the New Covenant, not of the Old; In brief, not of the Law, but of the Goſpel: And this is that which the Apoſtle ſhews expreſly, Rom. 10.15, 16, 17. <hi>How beautifull are the feet of them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that preach the Goſpel!</hi> But they have not believed the Goſpel. For <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who hath believed our Report? So then faith comes by hearing, viz.</hi> by hearing of the Goſpel.

                  <p>And this is all the Law can do, it can but fit a man for Jeſus Chriſt, and prepare a man for faith, which is indeed and properly effected in him by the Goſpel. This is the royall and triumphant Chariot in which the Son of God comes riding gloriouſly into the ſoul, and ſo dwelleth there by faith, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17.

                  <p>Is it the Goſpel word that makes believers? Then ſurely they are in <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> an infinitely ſad Condition who want the Goſpel, who want it wilfully, as the Jews do, and have done many hundred years. They have it, but they put it from them, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. They receive the Prophets words, but they receive not the Apoſtles words. And how then ſhould they believe through their word? And there are others in the world who want it neceſſarily or of neceſſity, and through the juſt ſeverity and righteous judgement of the Lord upon them. Many perſons, many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in this lamentable caſe to this day. They have no Goſpel, and ſo no means at all to work faith in them, <hi>without which there is no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> No, they are ſhut up under unbelief, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32.

                  <p>Is it the Goſpel word that makes believers? then certainly it is no <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> other word that is the means or ground of faith. We have a company of men in our times that believe ſtrange things, that bottom faith upon a ſtrange foundation, Revelations and diſcoveries of a ſpirit that hath no commerce at all, no agreement with the Goſpel: let the Apoſtles word be what it will, if they have another word from that which they conceive to be the ſpirit of God, they believe that, and not this; whereas the ſpirit that brings men any other Goſpel then that which the Apoſtles taught, though he come from heaven it ſelf, ought not to be believed, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. And yet alas how confident have many been in their aſſent to ſuch diſcoveries as have been clear againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the Apoſtles words? Ah, my beloved, this is not revelation, but deluſion; this is not faith, but unbelief. Our Saviour ſpeaking in my Text of all that ſhould believe from that time in which he prayed to the end of the world, deſcribes them to be ſuch as ſhould believe through the Apoſtles word. Not through any other word but that of the Apoſtles only, that which they preached, and that which they writ, which they have left recorded in the Scripture. If any man believe through any other word, or any other revelation that accordeth not with this, he is none of Chriſts beleivers, none of them which he owns, none of them for which he prayes; <hi>I pray for them that ſhall believe on me through their word;</hi> For them and none but them. He that believes through any other word, you ſee, is out of Chriſts prayer.</p>

                  <p>And thus of Chriſts deſcription of the perſons for whom he here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Suitor to his Father: <hi>Them which ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Proceed we to the matter of the prayer which he makes for theſe perſons; And there are two main things that he deſires in their hehalf. Firſt that they <hi>may be one;</hi> next that they may be in <hi>one place together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe he propoſes in the verſe that I have read, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes in the ſucceeding verſes. 1. He propoſes it in the verſe that I have read, <hi>that they may all be one as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> 2. And then he proſecutes this Suit of his with divers arguments and reaſons to <hi>ver.</hi> 24. as (God permitting) we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the propoſal of this Suit of his, you may obſerve that it is both expeſſed and amplified. Firſt it is nakedly expreſſed in plain terms, <hi>that they may all be one.</hi> Secondly, then it is amplified by a Similitude in which our Saviour ſhews how he would have them to be one, <hi>as thou father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> A ſtrange expreſſion if you look upon it with a ſuperficial view: That the Diſciples of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be one in ſome reſpects, is very eaſie to imagine. But how they ſhould be one as God the Father and the Son are one: how they ſhould be in God and Chriſt, as they are in one another, is very hard to be conceived: Yet this is the expreſsion of our Saviour to his Father in my Text, <hi>That they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For clearing this, beloved, you muſt know, that <hi>[as]</hi> in Scripture many times is a note of ſimilitude, not of equality; It intimates the truth and the reality of that wherein likeneſs ſtands, and not the meaſure and degree. I might give many inſtances wherein that Particle is ſo taken. See Luke 6.36. <hi>Be mercifull as your heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi> It is impoſsible for any man to be as mercifull as God is, if you look to the degree; <hi>For as the heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are his thoughts
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:46169:246"/>
above ours</hi> in this particular. But yet we may be mercifull as he is, though not as mercifull as he is. So in the Text our Saviour prayes for his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>That they may all be one as thou Father art in me and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi> The meaning is not that they may be one as nearly (that is impoſsible) but, as truly as we are: That as we are in one another, ſo they may (in ſome reſpect) be all in us. How and in what reſpect they may be ſo, I ſhall ſhew at large anon, in the mean time the point is this.</p>

                  <p>Indeed it is the will of Jeſus Chriſt that his Diſciples ſhould be one <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> among themſelves: <hi>That they ſhould be all one,</hi> as you have it in my Text: Indeed he ſhed his blood for this purpoſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14. that though they be of divers Nations (as for inſtance, Jews and Gentiles) yet they may be both one, as in the fore-alledged Scripture. <hi>He is our peace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>who hath made both one, having aboliſhed in his fleſh the enmity, to make in himſelf of twain</hi> (of Jews and Gentiles) <hi>one man.</hi> Though they be of divers places, ſome in heaven and ſome on earth; and though they that are on earth, are many of them many thouſand miles aſunder, yet he would have them to be all one. It is his project and deſign to gather all things into one, which are in heaven and which are in earth, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. But you will ask me, How can this be done, that they that are ſo diſtant ſhould be one?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Very eaſily, becauſe the bonds of this conjunction are not carnal but ſpiritual: So that they may be one, without a corporeal or local union. <hi>From him the head</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all the body by joints and bands is knit together,</hi> Col. 2.19. Part of the body is in heaven, and part of it is on earth, and here ſome perſons are in one, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther quarter of the earth: yet all the body ſo divided and ſo diſtant as you ſee, <hi>by joints and bands is knit together.</hi> And you will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, when you conſider what theſe bands are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They have all one ſpirit, and ſo in that reſpect are one. I ſpeak not of the ſpirit or ſoul of a man, but of the ſpirit of the Lord Chriſt, which being one, dwells in all the Saints at once, and ſo makes them one too; yea let them be as diſtant as they will. And as the formal reaſon of the union of the members of the body natural, conſiſteth not ſo much in contiguity as animation by the ſame ſoul; ſo that if any part be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and if the ſoul give over to enliven it, it is no more to be eſteemed a member, notwithſtanding its external and corporeal inherence to the body: So though the Saints be far from one another in regard of place, yet they are cloſely knit together by the ſame ſpirit, being joyned to the Lord, they are all one ſpirit, and ſo indeed are all one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They have all one faith, (one at leaſt in fundamentals) and one faith makes one, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5. They that are of many faiths in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:46169:247"/>
cannot come ſo cloſe together to be all one; and therefore Jeſus Chriſt <hi>when he aſcended up on high, gave gifts unto men for the work of the Miniſtry, and for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, till we all come,</hi> all, both Jews and Gentiles come, <hi>in the unity of the faith,</hi> &amp;c. So that there is a unity in the faith you ſee; and to ſay truth, my Brethren, faith will make a union at a diſtance, as well as if the perſons joyned were all together: What doth th the corporal or local preſence of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the union that is made by faith, which is a ſpiritual and invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible thing, and conſequently joineth in a ſpiritual and inviſible manner, which no diviſion or diſtance in regard of place can hinder?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They have all one heart, and one affection, and ſo in that reſpect are one. <hi>The multitude of believers were of one heart,</hi> Act. 4.32. Though they were multitudes, yet they had but one heart; and when there is but one heart, there is a great Oneſs. The underſtanding is the principle of ſpeculation, the heart the ſeat of love and of affection. And the Saints are ſo united and linked togther in affection, as if they had among them but one common principle of this affection, as if they had but one heart; and therefore the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the faithful, ſaith, <hi>that they were knit together in love,</hi> Col. 2.2. The term there uſed importeth ſuch a knitting as is between the divers parts and peices of a building. For ſo the Saints, though there be Millions of them in the world, yet they are <hi>built up altogether to a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. And love is as it were the morter and the pins, the ligaments and tyes of the connexion; and elſewhere it is called a <hi>bond,</hi> Col. 3.10. <hi>Above all theſe things put on charity which is the bond of perfectneſs,</hi> with which we are perfectly join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, 1 Cor. 1.10. Now love will make a union at a diſtance (as well as near at hand.) The nearneſs of the place (ſimply conſidered in it ſelf) contributes nothing to the nearneſs and to the ſtrength of the affection: No, love will reach a perſon at the other end of all the earth as well as if he were juſt by us, in the very next room, or in the very next dwelling.</p>
                  <p>You ſee both that, and how, it is the will of Jeſus Chriſt, that his Diſciples ſhould be one among themſelves, which is the firſt thing in the point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> But now there is a Second branch, he would not have them only to be one among themſelves, but he would have them alſo to be one in God. This is the ſpecial thing for which he is a Suitor to his Father in my Text, <hi>That they may be all one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us:</hi> Not one among themſelves alone, but <hi>one in us;</hi> which is indeed a very high thing.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may the better know what Chriſt intends in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, you muſt conſider that he ſpeaks to God the Father, as man and Mediator in this place: For he ſpeaks in prayer here; and conſequently when he ſaith, <hi>As thou Father art in me, and I in thee;</hi> he ſpeaks not of the union which is between his Father and himſelf as he is God: For in that conſideration the Father and the Son are ſo in one another, that they are the very ſame; The ſame Eſſence (for ſo the union is Identical) though they be not the ſame Perſon: And in this ſenſe it is impoſſible for
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:46169:247"/>
Chriſts Diſciples to be ſo one in God and Chriſt, as God and Chriſt, the Father and the Son, are the one of them in the other.</p>
                  <p>Well then our Saviour ſpeaks here of the oneneſs which is between his Father and himſelf, as he is the Mediator, and as he is the Head of his Church: For ſo they are both one, as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. And in another place he uſes the very ſame expreſſion in my Text, and tells us that he is in the Father, and the Father in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10.</p>
                  <p>Now the Father is in Chriſt as he is Mediator of the Church, and Chriſt is in the Father in the ſame reſpect, that is, they are both one, eſpecially three ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By Hypoſtatical union of the Manhood to the Godhead in the Perſon of our Saviour; for the Manhood being joyned to the Godhead in the Perſon of the Son, it muſt be mediately joyned alſo to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to whom the Son as God is joyned in the neareſt tye that can be. We have no higher phraſe you know my Brethren, to expreſs the cloſeſt union, then to affirm of two that they are one, they two are are one, and we cannot ſay more. There is a union between faithful friends, for there is one heart in two bodies, as the Philoſopher expreſſes it: There is a nearer union between man and wife, for they two are <hi>one fleſh,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.31. and therefore they have one name. But there is the neareſt union between the Father and the Son: for they two have one Eſſence, one Nature, one Name: And ſo the Godhead being joined to the Manhood in the Perſon of our Saviour, that Manhood by and through that God-head muſt needs be neerly and indiſſolubly joyned to God the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God the Father and the Son are one by dear affection. Thus they are in one another, and they live in one another (as it were) by inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible and tender love, which they bear to one another. How doth the Father love the Son beyond expreſſion, and that as he is Mediator? for under that capacity he ſpeaks of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. and he ſeems to glory in it, <hi>Behold my ſervant,</hi> mine Elect, <hi>in whom my ſoul delighteth!</hi> and in another place he gives this atteſtation out of heaven to him, Mat. 3 17. <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, q. d.</hi> I have ſome other children that I love well, but <hi>This is my Beloved Son</hi> above the reſt, take notice of him, this is he. And hence he lays him in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome next his heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. acquaints him with his counſels, tells his ſecrets to him, entruſts him with the revelation of them, ſets him in the higheſt place next to himſelf, advances him above, yea far above all principalities, and mights, and Dominions, and puts more honour on him then he doth on all the creatures: And hence the Son is often ſpeaking of the Fathers love to him: and on the other ſide profeſſes his affection to the Father, and he would have the world to know it too, Joh. 14.31. <hi>That the world may know that I love the Father, ſo do I.</hi> So that you ſee here is union of dear love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Father and the Son are one by unexpreſſable agreement and conſent together. Though they be divers, yet they never differ; No, they continually mind the ſame things, they will and nill the ſame
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:46169:248"/>
things, love and hate the ſame things; and this agreement is between the Father and the Son, not only as the Son is God, but as the Son is Man and Mediator too. The will of Jeſus Chriſt as he is Man, in all reſpects accordeth and conſenteth with the will of God the Father. Or if it were not ſo, it muſt be ſinful and irregular; and therefore he ſubmitted ſtill, yea even in thoſe things which were againſt the Nature that he had aſſumed; <hi>Not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus you ſee how the Father is in Chriſt as he is Man and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and how Chriſt as Mediator is in God the Father, how they are both one, <hi>viz.</hi> by hypoſtatical union, by dear affection, by unexpreſſable agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſent together.</p>
                  <p>Now we ſhall eaſily diſcover how he would have his Apoſtles to be one, in his Father and himſelf, which is the ſecond thing to be unfolded in the point. It is the will of Jeſus Chriſt, that his Diſciples ſhould not only be one among themſelves, but that they alſo ſhould be one in God, in the Father and the Son. This is the ſpecial thing for which he prays, <hi>That they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then as the Father is in Chriſt as Mediator, and Chriſt as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the Father by the Hypoſtatical union: ſo Chriſt would have his Diſciples to be in both of them by the myſtical union: That as the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Son is mediately in God the Father, in being joyned to the Godhead of the Son, which is one with God the Father; ſo we ſhould alſo be mediately in the Father, in being joyned to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head and the Manhood in the Perſon of Chriſt: That we ſhould be in the Father by and through Jeſus Chriſt: And ſo indeed are all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body myſtical, by reaſon of their union with the Lord Chriſt. Chriſt is one with God the Father, and we are one with Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore (in a ſenſe) we are one with God the Father; Jeſus Chriſt is in the Father, and we are in Jeſus Chriſt, Epheſ. 1.10. <hi>We all are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into one in him;</hi> and therefore we are alſo mediately in the Father: And hence it is that all the Saints are ſaid not only to be one among themſelves, and to be one in Chriſt, but alſo to be one in God the Father, as in my Text you ſee, <hi>I pray for them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that ſhall believe on me, that they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us;</hi> not one among themſelves, but <hi>one in us.</hi> Not in me only, but in thee too; Not one in me, but <hi>one in us:</hi> So that you ſee, believers all of them are in the Father by the Son.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As God the Father and the Son are one by dear affection; ſo Chriſt would have all his Diſciples to be one both with the Father and himſelf in the very ſame manner: He would not have them only to be one among themſelves by love, but he would have them alſo to be one in God by love: He would have their hearts to live in his Father and himſelf by unexpreſſible and choice affection: That they ſhould find no reſt, no quiet anywhere but in God and Chriſt only: To be ſo cloſely and indiſſolubly joyned to the Father and himſelf, that nothing in the world <hi>ſhould be able</hi> to divide them, <hi>to ſeparate them from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="451" facs="tcp:46169:248"/>3. As God the Father and the Son are one by will and by conſent; ſo Chriſt would have all his Diſciples to be one with the Father and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the very ſame manner. And as the Father and the Son agree in every thing, and never differ in the leaſt degree; that which one wills, the other wills: So true believers ſhould agree in every thing, not among themſelves only, but with God and Chriſt too. God and Jeſus Chriſt and they ſhould ſo accord in every thing, that they ſhould be as it were all one. Look what God and Chriſt wills, aſſoon as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and revealed to them, they ſhould will the very ſame, yea though it be againſt them in their honours, profits, pleaſures, and delights. They ſhould conform their wills in all reſpects to the will of God and Chriſt. And even as Chriſt ſaid to the Father, <hi>Not my will, but thine be done:</hi> So we ſhould ſay to the Father and Son, Not our wills, but yours be done. As you agree together, ſo we agree in you; and then indeed, my Brethren, we are like to agree among our ſelves, when we agree in God and Chriſt, and when our wills are ſuitable to their wills: Or otherwiſe agreement without this is combination and not union. And therefore Chriſt deſiring that his Diſciples ſhould be one among themſelves, deſireth alſo that they might be one in God, in his Father and himſelf, <hi>That they may all be one as thou Father art in me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now to deſcend to Application, and therein to proceed with all the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> branches of the Explication in their order. Firſt, Is it the will of Jeſus Chriſt that his Diſciples ſhould be one in God, by the myſtical union? Here then you ſee the glorious priviledge of Chriſts Diſciples, of all that do indeed believe in him. The Scripture makes it a great matter to be nigh to God, and ſo it is indeed, my Brethren, a very bleſſed and a happy thing. What is it then, Beloved, to be in him, in the Father and the Son, as they are in one another? This is a priviledge to purpoſe, and carries high and glorious things in it, ſuch as we are not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and much leſs are we able to expreſs. I ſhall endeavour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the light I have, to lay them open to you in a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>This being in the Father and the Son, implies moſt intimate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> with them both. It is very much, my Brethren, to be with them, to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. All of us are far from God, and far from Jeſus Chriſt by nature: we dwell a great way from them in a ſtrange Countrey, and ſo have no commerce with them; and when we are converted, we are ſaid in Scripture <hi>to be made nigh to them,</hi> Epheſ. 2.13. <hi>To have acceſs by one Spirit, to the Father and the Son,</hi> verſ. 17, 18. And this indeed importeth near and ſweet Communion with them, ſuch as the world is not acquainted with. But to be in them, importeth yet more near and cloſe Communion: Indeed the neareſt, and the cloſeſt, and moſt intimate that can be. It is much to be with God, with the Father and the Son; there muſt be heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion if it were but ſo: But to be in them as they are in one another, this muſt needs be much more.</p>
                  <p>This being in the Father and the Son, importeth ſpecial intereſt in God.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                     <pb n="452" facs="tcp:46169:249"/>
The greateſt intereſt that can be when we expreſs the intereſt that any man hath in ſuch or ſuch a great man, we uſe to ſay that he is in with him. And truly it is much to ſay that we are in with God the Father, and with Jeſus Chriſt, this is a very great matter; It ſhews that we have much of their regard and love; That God and Jeſus Chriſt, and we are great friends; That while all the world are out with the Father and the Son, we are the only people that are in with them: This I confeſs is very much: But what is it then to ſay that we in them? That God and Jeſus Chriſt, and we, are in a ſenſe all one; That as the Father is in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, ſo we are one in both of them. Here is intereſt indeed, ſuch as is impoſſible to be expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This being in the Father and the Son, importeth great acquaintance with them both: They that are much with one another, are acquainted each with other; but they that are in one another, muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted much more: They know not that which is without only, that which every one knows, but they know that which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is obſcure and hid from other men. They know God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, for they are in him; <hi>They know the ſecrets of his heart,</hi> Pſal. 25.14. <hi>and the myſterie of his will,</hi> Epheſ. 1.9. And even as Chriſt is ſaid to be in the boſome of the Father, and ſo to be the only one that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him fully, and can reveal him to the world, Joh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him:</hi> So true believers are in the boſom both of God and Chriſt, and ſo are infinitely more acquainted with them, then any in the world beſides. And here to be a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, they know God more immediately, and more diſtinctly then others do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They know God more immediately then others do: they do not know him at a diſtance, and at ſecond hand, but they know him by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; they have their knowledge of him at the Fountain head, for they are in him. Others hear of him by the hearing of the ear, but they ſee him, <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. and they taſte him, which ſenſe requires the neareſt applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the object, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. They know him at firſt hand, they are taught of God himſelf; they do not only hear what others ſpeak of God, and ſo accordingly diſcourſe of him, as many do by memory: but they ſpeak with God himſelf; God ſhews himſelf to them, as his own phraſe is, and ſo accordingly are more immediately acquainted with him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as they know him more immediately then others, ſo they know him more diſtinctly then others; they have not a confuſed knowledge of him only as we have of ſtrangers, or thoſe whom we behold a far off: as when we ſee a perſon at a great diſtance, it may be we diſcover that it is a man, or a woman in the general, but are not able to diſtinguiſh whether it be ſuch a man, or ſuch a woman, whether it be ſuch a friend, or ſuch a one of our acquaintance, yea, or no: But they have a clear knowledge, they ſee God evidently, and diſtinctly, in a meaſure, for they are near enough to him, they are in him: ſo that they can diſtinguiſh God, and Chriſt, from any other that comes in his Name, or that pretends that he is God, or Chriſt. And therefore, my Beloved, when there are any ſuch abroad (as
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:46169:249"/>
ſome have been in our days) who ſay that they are Chriſt, you ſhall do well to call one of them who are in Chriſt, to tell you whether this be Chriſt indeed, or no.</p>
                  <p>This being in the Father and the Son, importeth ready, eaſie, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> acceſs to the Father and the Son. They are in one another, and therefore they muſt needs be much together. Believers need not to go far to ſpeak with God, he is at hand continually, for they are in him: So that they have his ear and heart too, they can come to him and ſpeak with him when they pleaſe. Others that are abroad, they hear him when he ſpeaks in publick, in the open Congregation, and when he cryeth in the place of concourſe, as the wiſe man ſpeaks: But alas they have no private talk with him as theſe have, when there is none but God and them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And therefore they that are without, that live without God, and without Chriſt, are fain to uſe thoſe that are in God and Chriſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to promote their ſuits to him.

                  <p>This being in the Father and the Son, doth carry in it a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> enjoyment of all the comforts, ſatisfactions, and contentments that the ſoul of man can reach after; For God involves and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him all the good that can be thought upon, and infinitely more then the poor narrow heart of man can reach to. We would think (abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of us) that we were very well if we had all the happineſs that all the creatures in the world could yield us: If we had ſuch a wife, houſe, gardens, ſervants, in-come by the year, honors, pleaſures and delights, as we would fancy to our ſelves, then we would think that we were happy men indeed. Why, my Beloved, whatſoever good there is to pleaſe, or give us ſatisfaction in the creatures any way (if we had them all together) is eminently and tranſcendently in God. They had it all from him, and therefore certainly he hath it all in him; and that without dregs too; The ſpirits and the quinteſſence of all theſe comforts are in God, refined from the droſſie part; ſo that in having him we have all. A naked God a naked Chriſt, is infinitely more to make a man compleatly happy, then all the comforts in the world without him. Or if it were not ſo my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, our ſtate in heaven would be worſe then it is here upon the earth; the happineſs of Heaven would be much below, and much inferiour to our earthly happineſs: In Heaven we ſhall have nothing elſe but God, no Sun, no Moon, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.23. The Creatures ſhall not give us comfort, as they do in this world; No, God ſhall be our Sun and Moon there: he ſhall be every thing to ſatisfie us, and content us, and to make us happy: <hi>He ſhall be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.18. Now if the Lord have not as much in him as all the creatures which we leave, when we are taken hence by death, we are loſers by the bargain, whereas we know the heighth, and the perfection of our happineſs is there where we have nothing elſe but God: And therefore certainly we ſtand in need of nothing elſe to make us abſolutely and compleatly happy. And whenſoever we have leaſt of
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:46169:250"/>
creatures, and moſt of God in this world, then we are neareſt to that full beatitude. Now God we have, if we be in him, my Beloved, and ſo we have the Fountain of all happineſs and ſatisfaction: He that is in God, in the Father and the Son, muſt needs have all that is in God, ſo far as it is neceſſary for him: And that indeed is all that can be.</p>

No, ſurely, they are ſo in one another, that they can never be divided each from other.

When God and Chriſt are rent aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each from other, believers ſhall be rent aſunder from them both: When God and Chriſt do come to part with one another, believers muſt expect to part with both; and that would be a ſad parting, if God the Father ſhould go one way, and Chriſt another, and believers a third, never to come together any more: But in the mean time, while they ſtay together, believers ſhall continue with, and in them both: while God the Father is in Chriſt, and Chriſt in God the Father, believers ſhall be one in them.

My Brethren, doth it ſeem a ſmall thing to you? conſider it a little and reſolve. Is it but a ſmall thing, that God ſhould take us into ſuch union with himſelf?

live and act as men that are in God, in the Father and the Son. There is a ſuitable expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to this purpoſe, Col. 2.6. <hi>As ye have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him.</hi> As you have taken him by faith, and ſo are made one with him, As you are in him, ſo walk in him. Even ſo ſay I to you, my brethren, As you are in God, in the Father and the Son, ſo walk in God; Take ſuch a courſe in the whole tenour of your converſation, as they ſhould do who are in God: And truly my beloved, that muſt be a ſtrict, a holy and exact courſe: As far as it is poſſible there muſt be no exorbitancy, no uncleanneſs in it. It was the proteſtation of the Lord to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he repeats to <hi>Aaron,</hi> when his Sons were cut off for drawing nigh to God with ſtrange fire, Lev. 10.3. <hi>Then</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid to</hi> Aaron, <hi>This is that the Lord ſpake ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will be ſanctified in them that come nigh me.</hi> Ah, my beloved, will God be ſanctified in them that are nigh him, and will he not be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in them that are in him? And if they muſt be holy who are nigh him, how holy muſt they be, my brethren, that are in him? in the Father and the Son: How preciſely and exactly muſt they live who live in God?</p>
               <p>And therefore I beſeech you, my beloved, who are advanced to this high Prerogative, look narrowly to all your wayes, and keep your ſelves, as far as it is poſſible, from every ſin; And that upon theſe three Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your ſin is ſtrangely and unutterably heightned by the ſtation that you have in the Father and the Son. It is ſuch an aggravation as I am no wayes able to expreſs. What, my beloved, will you ſin in God? ſhall God have wickedneſs counted in him, by your means? will you be intemperate, will you be wanton, and laſcivious and unclean in any kind? will you be covetous and worldly? will you be unjuſt in God? you do what lies in you to draw the infinitely pure and holy God into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with you in your ſin. Indeed ſin cannot be committed by him, but by your means it is committed in him, which is a horrid and amazing thing to think upon. You do what lies in you, to defile and pollute the holy God with the impureſt and uncleaneſt thing in all the world, (for ſo is ſin) with that which is moſt againſt his nature, which is moſt odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abominable to him, which he is no wayes able to endure. And you are ſo audacious, that you do not only do it nigh him, and do it by him, but you do it in him. Ah, my beloved, me thinks your hearts ſhould not be ſtrong enough to bear up under that weight of ſuch wikedneſs as this is, but that they ſhould even faint and ſink within you.</p>
               <p>Why my beloved, for thoſe that are without God, and who are far from him (as wicked men are ſaid to be) their ſins do not ſo much concern God, they cannot be ſo grievous and ſo vexatious to him. But to have ſin committed in him, this is a moſt unſufferable provocation; This goes very near him, becauſe it is done ſo near him. I beſeech you think upon it, and let it have a mighty operation on your hearts; The ſins of other men are committed out of God, but yours are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:46169:251"/>2. As they are committed in him, ſo in the ſecond place they cannot chooſe but be obſerved by him: For God takes ſpecial notice of them, and their carriage and behaviour who are in him. So that they cannot do amiſs, they cannot ſtep awry in any thing, but he ſpies them, he knows their lying doing and riſing up, takes notice of their very thoughts, obſerves them how they go to bed, and how they riſe, whether they think of him, whether they call on him, or no; They are ſo near him that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chooſe but mark them. For others that belong not to him, that are without God and without Chriſt in the world, he looks not ſo much after them: But for thoſe that are within him, they cannot but be under his immediate care, and ſpecial eye: He ſearcheth out their wayes: he doth not ſuperficially obſerve them only, but he ſearcheth deep into them, he ſees their very grounds and ends, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail in any thing, no not ſo much as in a circumſtance, but he ſpies them.</p>
               <p>And this me thinks, ſhould make us very circumſpect in all our wayes, and infinitely cautious that we ſin not. That of the Prophet is remarkable, Jer. 8 19. <hi>Is not the Lord in</hi> Sion? <hi>is not her King in her? why then have they provoked him to anger?</hi> And I may ſay upon the other ſide, Is not <hi>Sion</hi> in the Lord? are not true believers in him, in the Father and the Son? why then have they provoked him to anger? They that are far away from God, perhaps may be the bolder to offend, becauſe they may conceive (with thoſe in <hi>Job</hi>) that he is ſhut up in the Clouds, and that he cannot ſee them at a diſtance; or if he do, he cannot reach them: But they that are in God, me thinks ſhould be very circumſpect; They ſhould conſider with themſelves that it concerns them to be wary how they walk, and what they do, becauſe he is at hand to ſpy their faults, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their provocations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And as the ſins of thoſe that are in God, cannot chooſe but be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by reaſon of their nearneſs to him, ſo neither can they chooſe but be corrected and chaſtiſed. The Lord will take a courſe with them, if they miſcarry, and if they misbehave themſelves, ſooner and quicker then he will with other men. And it concerns him ſo to do in point of honour; for their iniquities reflect with more diſparagement upon him then the ſins of others do, who are further from him. It would be much for God to ſuffer ſin by him: but do you think that God will ſuffer ſin in him? That he will let it neſtle there without controul, as if he liked it, and as if he took delight in it? Would not this be a very great diſhonour to him, that God ſhould not reform thoſe that are in him? Aſſuredly, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if God will be ſanctified in them that are nigh him, he will be ſanctified in them that are in him; either one way or the other, in their holy Converſation, or in their viſible Correction, as he was in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, that thoſe that are without may not blaſpheme, as if he ſuffred ſin and approved it well enough in thoſe that are near to him. No, they ſhall know, that he miſlikes it moſt of all in them. If he ſee many aliens to him, doing any wickedneſs, he may bear with them long perhaps, for it concerns him not ſo much to deal againſt them; But if he ſpy one of his own among them, one of them that is in him, he will ſingle ſuch a

one and cull him out from all the reſt and ſay, You are in me, and in my Son, you are united to me in the neereſt bonds; and what will you do as theſe vile abominable wretches do? Come, I muſt order you (though I let the reſt alone) I muſt not ſuffer you in ſuch courſes.</p>

If he ſeem to forget his Church at any time, to be aſleep, while ſhe is ſinking, do you come to him when you are with him in his privie Chamber, and ſpeak a good word for her. Mind him of her ſad condition, and beſeech him earneſtly to think upon her and relieve her. They that are abroad, my brethren, cannot do it; They cannot have acceſs to God, they have no intereſt in God at all. But you, my brethren, are not only in with him, but you are in him, ſo that you have his ear and heart: you can prevail ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly with God, and therefore ſee you be not wanting to promote the Churches cauſe with him.

               <p>Brethren, there are ſome ſtreights upon us at this time: we are involved in difficulties, more then every eye ſees. I ſpeak as unto wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay. And therefore you that are in God, that are more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with him then others are, be ſure that you plead hard before him, night and day in ſuch a time as this is. The buſineſſes that are in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, are of a very great concernment, and therefore ſee that you improve all the reſpect and intereſt you have in God, about them.</p>

You that are men of earthly might, do not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them by your power, leaſt they cry and God hear: And he will very quickly hear them, being in him. You may abuſe and injure others with infinitely leſs danger, for they are far from God, they are a great way of, and ſo may cry, yea cry aloud and not be heard: But they that are in God, are certainly within hearing. And therefore be adviſed how you meddle with them, and make them cry ſo cloſe to God, leaſt the Lord hear and it diſpleaſe him.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="459" facs="tcp:46169:252"/>2. Being in God, he will certainly redreſs them when they make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to him. It cannot be but he muſt be extreamly tender of thoſe who are ſo near to him. What do you think that the Almighty God will ſuffer men to be abuſed in him? A wicked wretch may touch another man indeed, and yet never touch God, becauſe he is without God, there is no union between God and him. But whoſoever touches him that is in God, muſt touch God in touching him. And hence ſaith the Lord himſelf, Zac. 2.8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of mine eye.</hi> In touching you, he toucheth me, and that in the moſt tender place, the very apple of mine eye. And do you think that God will ever ſuffer ſuch audacious boldneſs as this is? That he will quietly ſit ſtill, and let ungodly wretches thruſt their fingers into his eyes, and pluck the very apples of his eyes out of his head? Take this and take all.</p>
               <p>If true believers be in God, you then that are out of God, endeavour <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> to keep in with them. In any caſe make them your friends, and keep them ſo, and do not fall at any difference or odds with them; You know not what you loſe, when you loſe their love and their friendſhip. A friend in place (they ſay) is worth ſomething. And certainly they are in place, that are in God, the beſt place that can be. And therefore it is good for thoſe that are without, and live abroad, to have ſome friends in this place; you may fare the better for them, and they may do you a good turn, and a good office there, when time ſerves. Wicked men have had advantage oftentimes by the friendſhip of believers; <hi>Moſes</hi> did a good turn for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> more then once, when he knew not what to do, and when he could not help himſelf. Alas, poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, he was an alien, he lived without God in the world: and therefore ſends for <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtill (who was in God) to ſpeak a word for him: and he was ready to ſollicite hard in his behalf, and divers times prevailed for mercy, till in the end his heart was hardned to his utter ruine. And therefore if you love your ſelves, make much of ſuch friends as theſe are.</p>
               <p>And thus far of the application of the firſt branch of the Explication of the point. I ſhall be briefer on the other two.</p>
               <p>Is it the will of Jeſus Chriſt, that true believers ſhould be one in God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                  </label> in the Father and himſelf by dear affection?</p>
               <p>You then that are believers, let your hearts be knit to God and Jeſus Chriſt, by this indiſſoluble bond; Let love make you all one. And as the Father and the Son are one among themſelves, ſo be you one in them by love. Let your affections to them be ſo high, as to unite you to the Father and the Son. And even as dear affection joyns you to your fellow-Saints that you are knit in love (as the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is) ſo let it joyn you much more to the Father, and the Son; for they are infinitely more to be beloved. Oh let your hearts no longer live in creature comforts, and in creature ſatisfactions (which do ſo often fail you and deceive you) but let them live in God, by inexpreſſable and choice love; There live, and there reſt, and there dwell, and there neſtle, as it were in the boſome of the Father and the Son.</p>
               <p>Mark that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>John</hi> 1.4.16. <hi>God is love
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:46169:253"/>
and he that dwelleth in Love, dewelleth in God, and God in him.</hi> God is love eſſentially: for whatſoever is attributed to God, is God. And he is the Original and fountain of the love that is Communicated to the Creature. All the Love with which we love him, or the Creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, comes from him: It is a ray of the divinity, a beam of God, a part of the divine nature. And ſeeing God is love in the ſence before expreſſed, eſſentially, originally, it follows thence, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> infers, that <hi>he that dwells in love, muſt dwell in God. He that dwells,</hi> that is, continues and abides <hi>in love,</hi> to fellow Saints and fellow-members, <hi>dwels in God:</hi> But he that dwells in love to God himſelf, dwells in God much more. And therefore I beſeech you, let your hearts ſet up their reſt in love to God and Jeſus Chriſt; there let them fix and dwell; let not your love be ſcattered up and down among the creatures as it is, but let it be united all in God: and let it joyn and unite you all to God: that nothing in the world may ever ſeparate you, or divide you from him.</p>
               <p>Brethren, you may be the loſers by Love of other things, or other friends; For after your affections and your hearts are ſet upon them, they may forſake you, and be unfaithfull and unkind to you. And beſides, you muſt beſtow ſome pains, and travail and expence on thoſe who are indeed beloved by you. Or elſe it is but a diſſembling, feigned love; for love where it is ſound and real, is very bountiful and very active. And hence it is, my brethren, that there is ſo little true affection in the world. The love of men is for the greater part, in complement, in ſhew and in appearance only: they will do nothing, they will part with nothing for thoſe whom they are pleaſed to call their friends, as they muſt do if they love in deed and truth.</p>
               <p>But now in loving God, my brethren, (though I acknowledge you muſt part with all for him) yet you ſhall be no loſers by it. Though you forgo your friends, your houſes, and eſtates, and all for him, you ſhall have him inſtead of all; Yea, you ſhall not have him only, but you ſhall be in him by this means.</p>
               <p>And therefore, I beſeech you my beloved, grow up into this uniting grace in theſe divided and diſtracted times, which will not only make you one among your ſelves, but one in God. But you will ask me how may this be done? I will give you ſome directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let prayer ſtruggle for it at the throne of grace. It cannot chooſe but be a pleaſing lovely ſuit indeed to be importunate with God to make us love him, and to draw up our hearts to him. A man would think that ſuch a ſweet requeſt as this, ſhould not be turned off with a denial. Its true that prayer is the great Catholicon and univerſal means in all caſes. But yet it is expedient in a ſpecial manner to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and enlargement of this grace of love, which is a ſpecial gift of the ſpirit It is the great work of the ſpirit of God to make us love God, and to endear our hearts to him. I know that Hope and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are graces of the Spirit, but Love is a prime grace. It is a grace of the firſt magnitude, and therefore placed firſt by the Apoſtle in that Catalogue of his, Gal. 5.22. <hi>The Love of God is ſhed abroad into our
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:46169:253"/>
hearts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. how ſo? <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt that he hath given us.</hi> And in another place he tells the Saints, <hi>Ye are taught of God;</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to love one another,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.1. None in the world can teach you this but God only. And if none but he can teach us to love our brethren whom we ſee, then much more none but he can teach us to love him whom we do not ſee, and therefore let us earneſtly beſeech him to help us to take forth this Leſſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us endeavour to grow up in the knowledge of the Lord, and as we know him better, we ſhall love him more. That which one affirms of Learning, may be well applied to God, <hi>Non habet inimicum niſi ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> He hath ſuch matchleſs excellency and beauty in him, that he that knows him, cannot chooſe but love him. Indeed while we are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him, the admirable worth and luſtre that is in him, doth not take a whit upon us. The Philoſopher will tell us, that the judgement muſt be firſt of all convinced of the worth and value of a thing, before the heart will cloſe with it, and the affections cleave to it. <hi>Nec enim potes aut amare quem neſcias, aut habere quem non amaveris,</hi> Thou canſt not love him thou knoweſt not, nor have him whom thou loveſt not. And hence it is that wicked and ungodly men love not God or Chriſt at all, becauſe they know him not at all; Or if they know him any way, it is not under ſuch a notion as makes him beautifull and lovely to them. Perhaps they know him as a Judge, or an Avenger, not as a Father, and a Saviour. And this is indeed the cauſe why the triumphant Saints in heaven love him more then the Saints militant on earth, becauſe they have a fuller, clearer and diſtincter knowledge of him. We ſee him darkly in a glaſs, but they ſee him face to face. And this is the reaſon alſo why we love not God ſo much on earth, as we ſhall do in heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe we know him not ſo well here, as we ſhall do in that place. So that our love to God you ſee, is anſwerable to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him: as we know him more, or leſs, ſo we love him more, or leſs. And therefore if we do deſire indeed to love him more, let us ſtrive to know him more.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another means to grow up in the love of God, is to have daily more communion and intimacy with him. And this, as I conceive it, is a means diſtinct from that which goes before: For it is one thing to know him, and another to have communion, and to be familiar with him. We know abundance with whom we have no intimacy in the world. No, we know them too well perhaps to be familiar with them. So we may have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative knowledge of the Father, and the Son, and yet may have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate acquaintance with them.</p>
               <p>And this is very neceſſary to encreaſe love. To kindle and enflame affection (as the Philoſopher obſerveth) there muſt be <hi>Convictus &amp; crebra converſatio.</hi> They muſt dine and ſupp together, they muſt walk and talk together. And whereſoever there is ſtrangeneſs, there can be no great love. And therefore if we would abound in the love of God and Chriſt, let us have more communion with them.</p>
               <p>Beloved if we be not wanting to our ſelves, we may be very much with God. We may ſpeak with him often in a day: we may talk with
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:46169:254"/>
him face to face in our addreſſes to his holy Majeſty, we may give him many viſits; he doth not interdict us, but invite us to come and ſup with him, and be acquainted with him throughly once; he is ſo pretious and ſo ſweet a friend, that we ſhall love him out of all meaſure.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Endeavour to the utmoſt of your power, to diſpoſſeſs your hearts of the unlawful love of worldly things; for this is incompatible &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the love of God. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.15. Let him be what he will (my Brethren) if he love the world, he loves not God: And therefore ler not any covetous and wretched worldling make ſhew of having any love to God; For certainly it is not in him. <hi>The friendſhip of the world,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>is emnity with God.</hi> And therefore if we would be friends of God, we muſt diſſolve this friendſhip with the world. Inordinate, irregular, unlawful love of worldly things, muſt be expelled: And as this love is caſt out, the love of God will come in.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Be often in the company and fellowſhip of thoſe that love God; Converſe with thoſe who are moſt endeared to him, and they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſpeaking of him, and ſeting forth his excellency, beauty, love, and ſo will kindle and enflame your hearts towards him. They who are full of ſweet affections to the Lord, if you be much among them, will work you to the ſame temper: You may obſerve it in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.10. and the following verſes, that when thoſe daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> who at firſt deſpiſed Chriſt, and wondred why the Church his Spouſe ſhould praiſe him ſo, and make ſuch a ſtir about him, yet when they had a while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Church, and heard her ſpeak of Chriſt with ſuch affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, admiring and extolling him above the skies, they alſo fall in love with him, and they will go together with the Church to ſeek him out; <hi>Whither is Beloved gone?</hi> ſay they, <hi>O thou faireſt among women, whither is thy Beloved turned aſide, that we may ſeek him with thee?</hi> And thus you ſee, my Brethren, frequent intercourſe and holy conference with thoſe that love God, is one effectual means to fill and to enflame our hearts with love to him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Labour to comprehend with all the Saints, the greatneſs of the love of God to you, and to aſſure it to your own ſouls. It is not all the beauty and the excellency in the world, that will allure us to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> love one that we imagine doth not love us: But if we ſee and be aſſured of the love of God to us, this will kindle love to him, and make our hearts to melt towards him: When we conſider with our ſelves what kindneſs he hath ſhewed to us, what he hath done for us, what matchleſs and unfathomed love he hath diſcovered to us, this will raiſe our affections high to him again, and make us even ſick of love: And therefore I beſeech you ſtrive to be more and more aſſured of this; for at this flame you muſt kindle your fire. Here you muſt fetch your little ſpark of love (whereof the Saints are capable in this life) from the love of God to you: which being kindled in your hearts, it will never leave aſpiring, and flying higher and higher ſtill, till it have joyned it ſelf unto that infinite and endleſs flame from whence it iſſued and proceeded.</p>
               <p>And indeed, as <hi>Bernard</hi> very well obſerves, we cannot anſwer God
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:46169:254"/>
or Chriſt ſo well in any thing as love. To ſay the truth, we muſt not anſwer him in other things. If he be angry, or diſpleaſed with us, we ought not be angry or diſpleaſed with him again. If he condemn and cenſure us, we ought not to condemn and cenſure him again; If he chide us, we ought not to chide him again. But if he love us, we may, we muſt love him again; Yea, he expecteth that we ſhould return him love for love, for he loves to be beloved.</p>
               <p>Is it the will of Jeſus Chriſt, that true believers ſhould be one in God,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                  </label> in the Father and the Son, by ſweet agreement and conſent? Then I beſeech you, my Beloved, comply with Jeſus Chriſt in this particular; As God and Jeſus Chriſt agree in every thing, ſo do you agree with them. Bring your mind to the mind of God, and to the will of God, that you may be of one mind, and one will: Have you no judgement of your own, as different from Gods, but judge of things as God doth: Let his wiſdom be your wiſdom; his reaſon, your reaſon; and his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, your determination: Have you no wills of your own, my Brethren, but let the will of God be your will, let it rule and order you: Let your will be ſo melted and reſolved into the will of God, that as far as it is poſſible, God and you may have but one will; That he may never croſs you, and you may never croſs him: Conſent to him in every thing; if he ſay any thing; true, Lord; if he do any thing; good, Lord; Yea, though it be againſt you in your ends, and in your natural deſires; yet ſay as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> to the Prophet, when he received a heavy threatning, <hi>Good is the word of the Lord which he hath ſpoken.</hi> Take heed there be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between God and you in any thing; let not him ſay one thing, and you another; will one thing, and you another: But ſay you as God ſays, and will you as God wills, that ſo you may be ſwallowed up in God, and that you may be one in him: And to this end I propound three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God and you agree not every way in all reſpects, you are out, and not he: And therefore it is beſt in all things to conform your minds and wills to his: His mind and his will is always right; and yours if they diſſent, are always crooked and oblique; and therefore it is beſt to bring your mindes and wills to his, and not to think to bring his to your own. The Malon when he tries the wall that he hath builded, by his rule, and findes them not to ſuit together, he doth not go and cut the rule and bring it to the wall, but he goes and mends the wall, till he have brought it to the rule. So if your minds and wills do not agree with God's, the fault is not in his, but yours; and therefore you muſt bend your minds and wills till you have brought them ſtraight like his; and not endeavour to make his crooked like your own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God and you agree not every way, as you are irregular, ſo you are undutiful. You are his ſervants, and you are his creatures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought in all things to be ruled by him. The Maſters will muſt be the ſervants will, in lawful things; and therefore in the Civil Law the ſervant is accounted in the Maſter, and not as a diſtinct perſon: And much more the Creators will muſt be the creatures will. He gives it being, both the beginning and continuance of it; and he that gives being, may
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:46169:255"/>
give Law to regulate the motions and the operations of the being that he gives, and may not be conteſted with in any particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If we agree not all in God, our agreement and accord among our ſelves is worth nothing: So far it is to be approved, as it doth unite in God. Then it is good and right indeed; when as the Father and the Son agree together, ſo we agree with both of them in the very ſame things. If we be of one mind and heart, in things wherein the Father and the Son are not of one mind with us, it were better we did differ then unite; for we unite not in a right center. But if as we be one among our ſelves, ſo we be one in the Father and the Son, this is indeed a bleſſed union: If Brethren ſo dwell together in unity, that all of them do dwell together in this one God, this is a happy and a heavenly conjunction: And therefore I beſeech you, my Beloved, let us look to this, that as we all agree, ſo we all agree in God and Jeſus Chriſt. Let us examin ſtill whether our conſent in any thing do meet and unite with theirs: Let us ſee what their mind and will is, and let us all accord in that together; For though we be not one againſt another, if God be againſt us all, it is a very ſad caſe. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> makes mention of love in the truth, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. Love in error is not to be accounted of, but to be avoided ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but love in truth is very pretious; conſent in error is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in, but conſent in truth, my Brethren, is a comfortable thing: For this is conſent in God, who is ſo often called <hi>Truth</hi> in Scripture. And if we ſo agree, and ſo conſent, we may depend upon it, we have Gods agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſent with us; and therefore let this be our great care, that Jeſus Chriſt may have his will in this buſineſs, according to his prayer in my Text, <hi>That they may be one as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us.</hi>

               <p>VVE are upon the matter of our Saviours Prayer, for them who ſhould believe in him by his Apoſtles word. And there are two main things, as I have noted formerly, that he deſires in their behalf: Firſt that they might be all one; Then that they might be all in one place. The firſt of theſe requeſts of his he propounds and proſecutes; propounds it in the verſe which we have even now inſiſted on, <hi>That they all may be one,</hi> &amp;c. And then he proſecutes it with divers argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſons, in this and the ſucceeding verſes.</p>
               <p>Whereof the firſt is taken from the furtherance, that this neer unity of theirs would be, to the acceptance of our Saviour in the world; <hi>That the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me: That they may all be one, as,</hi> &amp;c. Why ſo? <hi>That the world may believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For Explication of the terms, the difficulty lies eſpecially in this, <hi>viz.</hi> what ſort of people our Saviour Chriſt intendeth by the <hi>world</hi> here; For to ſay truth, the <hi>world</hi> is taken divers ways; I think more differently
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:46169:255"/>
then any other phraſe almoſt in Scripture: Sometimes we find it uſed for elect and ſanctified, and ſometimes for reprobate and unſanctified perſons: Sometimes we find it taken for believers, and ſometimes for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, as I could give you inſtances of both theſe. And when for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; ſometimes for thoſe who believe not for the preſent, but ſhall believe in after times; ſometimes for thoſe who neither do believe nor ſhall believe. Now all the queſtion is, which of theſe three ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple our Saviour Chriſt denoteth by the world in this place.</p>
               <p>There is no colour to conceive that the world ſhould here be taken for believers, for ſuch as did then believe when Chriſt ſpake theſe words; the very next word that he adds doth evidently croſs and daſh that; <hi>That the world may believe that thou haſt ſent me:</hi> So then the world in this place apparently importeth unbelievers. But whether ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived not for the preſent, but ſhould believe in after times: Or ſuch as neither did believe, nor ſhould believe: Whether elected unbelievers, or reprobated unbelievers, will need a little briefly to be enquired and reſolved.</p>
               <p>Some of no ſmall authority conceive, that by the <hi>world</hi> is meant elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unbelievers; ſuch as did not then believe, but ſhould believe in after times (conceive it with a ſaving and a juſtifying faith) and that the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Chriſts Diſciples unity among themſelves. And hence he prays, <hi>That they may all be one as thou Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the world may believe that thou ſent me.</hi> But if our Saviour had intended juſtifying faith in theſe words, in probability he would have ſaid, <hi>that the world may believe</hi> in me. They are but poor believers that come no further then barely to aſſent to this, that Jeſus Chriſt is ſent of God the Father; a reprobate may do this.</p>
               <p>Beſides (which carries me exceedingly) me thinks the world is here apparently oppoſed to ſuch as did believe, and ſhould believe with a juſtifying faith. Our Saviour mentions it as oppoſite to both theſe. In the firſt place you know, he prays for ſuch as did believe, when he made this prayer; and then for ſuch as ſhould believe in after times: <hi>Neither pray I for theſe only, but for them alſo that ſhall believe on me, that they may all be one,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That the world,</hi> who neither do believe, nor ſhall believe with a juſtifying faith, may yet by this means be ſo far convinced, as hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to aſſent to this, <hi>That thou haſt ſent me, q. d.</hi> This is that which I deſire, that they who ſhall in after times believe by my Apoſtles word, may by their unity ſo far convince and work upon the world that never ſhall believe, as that they may be brought to this at leaſt, to acknowledge that thou haſt ſent me: For ſo believing here is nothing elſe but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or acknowledging: and therefore in the 23. verſe that word is uſed, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> You ſee the meaning of the words. The point to be obſerved is this:</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The unity of Chriſts Diſciples is one eſpecial means to cauſe the world to have the better thoughts and apprehenſions of their Maſter.</head>
                  <p>Though this will not convert the world, and bring them to be true believers, yet this will very much convince the world, and make them look with a better eye on Chriſt, and on the Doctrine of the Goſpel, when they that teach it and profeſs it, harmoniouſly agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And hence is this Petition of our Saviour here, <hi>that they may all be one,</hi> &amp;c. that ſo the world (although it be an enemy to me) yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſent and love, and unity of my Diſciples, of them that own me and profeſs me, may be even forced to acknowledge and confeſs that I am ſent of God, that my Doctrine is of God, and that I am not (as the world is apt to think) a ſeducer and impoſtor, <hi>q.d.</hi> If my Diſciples be not one among themſelves, if they be rent aſunder by a ſpirit of diviſion, the world will never yield that I came forth from thee, who art the God of love and peace; That thou haſt ſent me down to be a Mediator and a Peace-maker, to make up all the breaches and the differences between thee and thy people. They will look ſtrangely upon me, and they will never be perſwaded to acknowledge that I am come on ſuch an Errand as this is. And therefore I beſeech thee, Father, that I may be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of a Mediator, and that I may be looked upon as ſent by thee; do thou take care that my Diſciples be at unity among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now here I ſhall a little more diſtinctly ſhew you, that the unity of Chriſts Diſciples in Doctrine and Opinion, and in Affection and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, is one eſpecial means to cauſe the world to have the better thoughts of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The unity of Chriſts Diſciples in Doctrine and Opinion is one eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they maintain and hold the ſame things, if they teach the ſame things, they will the ſooner gain the approbation and aſſent of thoſe that are without; But if they wrangle and contend, this will make them more averſe from Jeſus Chriſt &amp; from the Goſpel. And truly no one thing almoſt hath kept men more aloof from Chriſt, and the Doctrine of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in and by &amp; through him, then the perpetual, hot and endleſs contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies and Diſputes that have been among the Teachers of the Goſpel. Nay, if they be not able to agree among themſelves, ſay they that are without, even let them all alone, we will carry till they do. And therefore the Apoſtles ſtill were very circumſpect to manifeſt agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent among themſelves in that which they delivered to the people, becauſe they knew of how great conſequence it was to further the ſucceſs &amp; effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of their Doctrine. It is obſervable that <hi>Paul</hi> joyns one or two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with himſelf in his Epiſtle, ſometimes <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> who were not inſpired men (as it is probably conceived) and ſo could not add a whit to the divine authority of his Epiſtle: But yet he ſhews how they accorded all together, for the better ſatisfaction
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:46169:256"/>
of the people. So the Apoſtles and the Elders and the Brethren go joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all together in the Reſolutions of the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem, Acts</hi> 15.23. that their decrees might find the readier entertainment among thoſe to whom they ſent them. And though it be a certain and confeſſed truth that the agreement and conſent of teachers, neither doth, nor can work ſaving faith in any (The word it ſelf, my brethren, as it is the Object, ſo it is the inſtrumentall cauſe of faith:) yet it may prepare the heart and work it up to better thoughts and apprehenſions both of Chriſt and of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The unity of Chriſts Diſciples in affection and in converſation is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> eſpecial means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If they live in unity and love and ſweet accord toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they that are Aliens to religion, ſtrangers to Jeſus Chriſt and to his Goſpel, will think the better of them for their ſakes. But if they be continually brawling and oppoſing one another, this keeps others off from Chriſt. If he be owned and followed by none but by a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of wrangling, quarrelſome contentious people, they will never cloſe with him. So that you ſee my brethren, it exceedingly concerns the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt and of the Goſpel, that they that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to him, avoid diſſentions with their brethren, for they reflect with very great diſparagement on him and it. And therefore the Apoſtle is ſo ſharp with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> becauſe they ſhewed their malice, and had their ſuits and controveſies each with other before unbelievers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. By which it ſeems they ſet them off the further, both from Chriſt and from the Goſpel. This ſhall ſuffice for the cleering of the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; proceed we to the application.</p>
                  <p>Now, is it ſo my brethren, that the unity of Chriſts Diſciples is one <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> eſpecial means to cauſe the world to have the better thoughts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then we ſee the reaſon, my beloved, why Jeſus Chriſt, and religion, and the Goſpel, are ſo deſpiſed and undervalued and neglected, why they are ſo ill thought of in theſe times. As certainly Chriſt and the Goſpel had never leſs eſteem and credit in the world, then they have in theſe dayes; And this is one great cauſe of it, there is ſo little unity among Chriſtians. Nothing but diſputes and quarrels, and conteſts among them everywhere; whither we look upon the Teachers or the Profeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt and of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>If we look upon the Teachers, how ſtrangely do they differ each from other everywhere! how do they croſs and thwart with one another, as if there were many Chriſts, and many Faiths, and many Goſpels, and more wayes then one to heaven! In the Apoſtles times it was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> they did harmoniouſly agree together. But now <hi>Paul</hi> is of one mind, and one way, and <hi>Timotheus</hi> of a ſecond, and <hi>Silva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of a third; So that the people are diſtracted, and in the end regard neither. They that are yet without, and to ſeek of their religion, know not what to pitch upon, but are the more eſtranged from Jeſus Chriſt and from the Goſpel. If the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, now here and now there: now this way, and now that: how ſhall the confuſed people gather themſelves into a body, and come to be at one among themſelves? If this Pulpit ſound with one thing, another with that which

is directly contrary to it; a third with that which contradicts both; where think you then ſhall poor unſtable ſouls ſettle? how is it poſſible but they that have not ſences exerciſed to diſcern, ſhould be carried up and down and really adhere to nothing, as it is at this day? And thus our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is expoſed to contempt, our Religion undervalued, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is ſlighted and deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we look on the profeſſors of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, how are they rent aſunder into factions! Oh what a ſpirit of diviſion is there up and down among them, ſuch as never was abroad till theſe times! They are of ſo many minds, and draw ſo many wayes, and have ſuch vehement and ſuch hot contentions and diſputes among themſelves, that they are no way to be pacified and appeaſed, unleſs the God of peace himſelf appear, and above all that we can think. All that time and pains, and heat, and zeal, and ſtrength which was wont to be beſtowed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate duties, in prayer, and examination, and humiliation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to be ſet a work about their own hearts, in mortifying, and ſubduing the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and the luſts that are there, is now laid out in making and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties, and in maintaining controverſies, and diſputes, in doating about frothy frivolous, and vain queſtions, that tend to ſtrife and variance, and not one whit to edification.</p>
                  <p>And this is that which alienates and keeps off thoſe that are without from cloſing with religion. This takes away the beauty and the luſtre of it, that may invite them, and allure them to it. When carnal men ſee nothing elſe but rents and breaches among profeſſors of religion, the glory of it is extreamly darkned in their eyes, and it is ſure a ſtone of ſtumbling to them, and ſuch a rock of ſcandal and offence as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get over. When we ſhew all our weakneſs in our paſſion, and in our violent and hot contentions, before the watchfull eyes of ſcornfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: when we uncover our ſelves in the ſight of the wicked as a fool uncovers himſelf, they diſdain us in their hearts, and with us our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion too. Nay if this be their Religion and profeſſion, to brawl, to wrangle, and to quarrell thus, I am even at a point (ſaith the prophane and graceleſs heart) I will have none of it. It is a choice and curious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt (if you obſerve it) upon the difference that fell out between the ſervants of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſervants of <hi>Lot,</hi> that at the very time when the contention grew, the Canaanite and Perezite was in the Land, Gen. 13.7. <hi>There was a ſtrife between the Herdſmen of</hi> Abrahams <hi>Cattle, and the Herdſmen of</hi> Lots <hi>Cattle, and the Canaanite and Perezite dwelled then in the Land.</hi> Their ſtrife was much the more vile, and the more diſadvantagious to religion, becauſe it was before them.</p>

There have been many Arguments and Reaſons uſed heretofore often, to ſtir us up to this endeavour, but none like this, that Jeſus Chriſt will be the more reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the better thought of in the world by this means. Now for the honour of Chriſt Jeſus, leave your wrangling and contending, and
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:46169:257"/>
agree among your ſelves; Do not ſo carry and demean your ſelves, as to perſwade the world that he was never ſent of God. He ſuffred ſhame and ignominy, and contempt for you; Oh, do not cauſe him now to ſuffer ignominy and contempt from you. You have ſeen the ſad effects of breaches and diviſions, many wayes, and this way among the reſt in theſe times: How much our bleſſed Saviour and the Goſpel ſuffers by the hot contentions of thoſe who call themſelves Saints. Ah, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if you have any love to Jeſus Chriſt, any regard at all to his eſteem and credit in the world, if you would have him in account and reputation, make up your breaches and differences, deny your ſelves for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>See how he beggs his Father for it in my Text, <hi>Let them be one,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as thou,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the world may believe,</hi> &amp;c. that they that are without may not be ſo ill perſwaded of me as they are. And if Chriſt be ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for it, if he begg for it of his Father, with ſo much affection, will you ſlight it, and look upon it as a ſmall matter? Oh labour to help on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which he is ſo intent upon, that ſo without hypocriſie you may ſay Amen to this Prayer.</p>
                  <p>And thus of the firſt Argument with which our Saviour proſecutes his ſuit to God the Father, that his Diſciples might be all one: Which hath been taken from the furtherance that this neer unity of theirs would be to his own entertainment in the world.</p>

And it is taken from the end at which he aimed in glorifying his Diſciples, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the glory which he had received from God the Father, and this was that they might be one; <hi>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one. q. d.</hi> Since I have glorified them ſo much as I have done, to this end <hi>that they might be one,</hi> I pray thee Father, let me not be diſappointed of my purpoſe, but let me have my end in this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Two things we have to be conſidered in the words. Firſt Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the glory which he received from the Father to believers. <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</hi> And ſecondly the end of this communication, <hi>that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> At this time I ſhall make a little entrance on the firſt of theſe, and that is Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the glory which he received from the Father to believers. <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If there be any queſtion what glory is intended by our Saviour here, whither that which he as God, enjoyed together with the Father from eternity; Or that which he as Man and Mediator of the Church, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Father: It is apparently reſolved in the words themſelves.
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:46169:258"/>
                  <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me.</hi> Chriſt hath no glory given him as he is God; but as he is Man, and Mediator, he hath much beſtowed upon him by the Father. Now that which he receives as man, he communicates to men, he gives it out again in ſome ſence and in ſome degree, to true believers, to all the living members of his body. As he affirmeth here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</hi> Them, whom?

               <p>Firſt, God the Father hath beſtowed much glory on the Son, as he is Man and Mediator of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſelf ſame glory which the Son as Man receives from God the Father, he communicates again, and gives it out in a ſort to all believers.</p>

                  <p>That which he receives as man, he communicates to men; as he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it in the humane nature, ſo to the humane nature he diſpenſes it again to all the members of his body. This is the thing which he affirms expreſly to his Father in my text, <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me, I have given them, q. d.</hi> As thou gaveſt it me for them, ſo I have given it to them. I have not kept it in my own hands, but have as freely parted with it, as I did receive it. I have been true to thee and them in this buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now for the through cleering of the Point, I ſhall review the glory which God the Father hath beſtowed upon the Son as Man and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Church, and that in all parts and branches of it. And then proceed to ſhew you particularly and diſtinctly, that this very glory, in all the parts and branches of it, Chriſt hath diſpenſed again in ſome degree to true believers; And when I have done this, I hope it will be evident, that the ſelf ſame glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="471" facs="tcp:46169:258"/>Then the Son, as man, receives moſt honourable titles from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as I have ſhewed you formerly at large; he calls him King, he calls him Lord. Yea, not Lord <hi>Adonai</hi> alone, but Lord <hi>Jehovah;</hi> which is indeed the higheſt and moſt glorious Title that belongs to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But doth Chriſt make theſe Titles over now to true believers? yes, my beloved, all of them without exception. As God makes him a Prince, ſo he makes them Princes; And as God makes him a King, ſo he makes them Kings, as the Church acknowledges, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.6. <hi>He hath made us Kings to God.</hi> As God calls him <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſo he calls the Church <hi>Jehovah,</hi> at leaſt ſhe is ſo called by his means, by reaſon of her union with him: For even as <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. it is ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This is his name by which he ſhall be called,</hi> Jehovah <hi>our righteouſneſs;</hi> ſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.16. it is ſaid of true believers, of the Church which conſiſts of true believers, <hi>This is her name, by which ſhe ſhall be called,</hi> Jehovah <hi>our Righteouſneſs.</hi> A man would think, Chriſt ſhould have kept this glorious and tranſcendent ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to himſelf, concerning which the Lord profeſſes, Iſa. 42.8. <hi>I am the Lord, I am</hi> Jehovah (for it is <hi>Jehovah</hi> there, not <hi>Adonai</hi> or <hi>Elohim) that is my name</hi> that is in a ſence, my proper and peculiar name; <hi>and my glory,</hi> the glory of that name, <hi>will I not give unto another.</hi> But when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives it unto the Son as Mediator, he doth not give it to another; for he is one with God the Father; and when the Son as Mediator, gives it to the Church, he doth not give it to another neither; She is ſo neer him that he will have her one way or other, to partake with him in this high glory.</p>
                  <p>The Son as man receives much glory from the Father, as in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which he gives the Son, ſo in the Titles which himſelf aſſumes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Son. In the New Teſtament, as I have ſhewed you, he calls himſelf no more <hi>the God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the God of</hi> Iſaac, and the Father of <hi>Iſrael, but the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He calls himſelf no more <hi>the Lord their God that brought them out of land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>but the God that brought again from the dead the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as he calls Chriſt ſo, ſo Chriſt makes him to call all true believers ſo. He will have them to ſhare with him by any means in this honour. Is God the God of Chriſt? why Chriſt makes him the God of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Is God the Father of Chriſt? why Chriſt makes him the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of believers. Is he the God that brings again from the dead the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? why he is the God too that will ſurely bring again from the dead all true believers, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>them that ſleep in Jeſus, will he alſo bring with him,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4.14. Me thinks it is as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid to him, That which thou art to me, thou ſhalt be to them too: That which thou doſt for me, thou ſhalt do for them too. I will have none of this honour, unleſs they partake with me.</p>
                  <p>The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father, in that he ſets <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> him at own right hand, in the next place to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Why now the ſelf ſame glory doth the Son beſtow upon the Church in that he ſets her at his own right hand, in the next place to himſelf. If Jeſus Chriſt be raiſed ſo high, how high is the Church raiſed? If
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:46169:259"/>
Jeſus Chriſt be ſo tranſcendently exalted in this, that he is ſet in the next place to God, how is the Church exalted then that ſhe is ſet in the next place to Chriſt! Look upon Chriſt, and you ſhall ſee that God hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him, <hi>and ſet him at his own right hand,</hi> Epheſ. 1.21. and then look upon the Church and you ſhall ſee, that Chriſt hath highly exalted her, and ſet her at his own right hand, Pſal. 45.9. <hi>On thy right hand did ſtand the Queen, (i.</hi>) the Church. Now, my beloved, is the place of Chriſt high? How high then is the Churches place? Is Chriſt at the right hand of God? She is at the right hand of Chriſt. Is Chriſt in the next place to God? She is in the next place to Chriſt. Is there none above Chriſt but God? None is above the Church, but Chriſt and God. Is he exalted far above all principality and powers, might and dominion, not only in this world, but in that which is to come; not only above all principalities and powers on earth, but even above all principalities and powers in heaven too; above the very Angels, yea, the higheſt orders of them? She is exalted far above them. As Chriſt comes between them and God, ſo ſhe comes between them and Chriſt, ſhe is neerer Chriſt in union, nature and dignity. The Angels are but Miniſters and ſervants whiles the Saints the members of the Church are heirs. Yea, they are Miniſters to theſe heirs. <hi>They are all</hi> the beſt of them, <hi>miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation,</hi> Heb. 1. ult. So that no marvail, though our Saviour tells his Father here, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Son as Man, receives much glory from the Father, in the vaſt authority and power which he hath veſted him withall.</p>
                  <p>Why now, the ſame power he diſpenſeth to the Church, to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by her Officers. And therefore having ſaid <hi>All power is given to me both in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> Mat. 28.18. he adds immediately to his Apoſtles in the very next verſe, <hi>Go ye, and teach all Nations, baptizing them. q. d.</hi> the power which is given me, I give you in ſome meaſure. As God the Father hath given me all power, ſo I give you ſome power, ſo much as you are capable of. And as the government is put upon my ſhoulders by the Father as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa</hi> 9.6. ſo I put over ſome part of this Government to you my under-Officers, whom I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to manage and negotiate the affairs of my Kingdom. As God the Father hath ſet me over his houſe, ſo I ſet you to be my Stewards under me, to whom I give the Keyes of this houſe. As God the Father hath given me the King-key of <hi>Davids</hi> Princedom which I keep my ſelf, ſo that <hi>I ſhut and no man openeth, I open and no man ſhutts:</hi> ſo I give you the Miniſterial Keyes, which I intruſt with you who are the Stewards and the guides of my houſhold: To whom I give a ſpecial power to open and to ſhut the doors of my houſe, to let in and put out. And though it be my own prerogative, and a chief flower of that Imperial Crown which God the Father hath been pleaſed to ſet upon my head, to ſeal pardons, and to forgive ſins, <hi>viz.</hi> to do it in the Court of heaven, and Conſcience: yet I commit to you my Viceroyes, and my under-Officers, a Miniſterial power both to remit, and to retain ſins in the outward Court, that is, the face and preſence of the Church, in regard of declaration.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:46169:259"/>
                     <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever you bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18, 19. And in another place, <hi>whoſeſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted; and whoſeſoever ſins you retain, they are retained.</hi> And in a word, as God the Father hath committed all judgement unto me, ſo I commit ſome judgement to you. And hence it is, my brethren, that the Church aſſiſted by her Officers, iudgeth them that are within, although ſhe judge not them that are without, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 1 Cor. 5.22. <hi>over whom no power is given her by the Lord Chriſt:</hi> But thoſe that are within, ſhe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and condemneth too if there be cauſe, and caſts them out, and gives them over to the Executioner; There take them Satan, diſquiet them, afflict them, for the deſtruction of the fleſh the carnal part, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father in the great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> offices of dignity and truſt and honour, which he hath advanced him to.</p>
                  <p>Why now the ſelf ſame glory hath the Son communicated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, in that he hath advanced them to the ſelf ſame Offices to which he is himſelf advanced by the Father. As God the Father hath made Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet to himſelf; ſo Chriſt doth make all true believers Kings and Prieſts to God his Father: for both thoſe Offices are mentioned Apoc. 1.6. <hi>He makes them to become a royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. A Prieſthood, and a royal Prieſthood. And as he makes them Kings and Prieſts, ſo he makes them Prophets too, to teach their families, and make known his wayes to them: to teach their neighbours and acquaintance, and to admoniſh one another within the compaſs of their own Spheres, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. In which reſpect it is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Apoſtle in the cited place, <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly,</hi> in you the people of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> not in the learned Doctors only, but in the private members of the Church: So that you ſee Chriſt hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced all true believers with him, to all the offices to which he is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by the Father, and ſo hath made them ſharers with him in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. None of the Types of Chriſt were ſo advanced in the figure. <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizideck</hi> was both a King, and Prieſt, as you may ſee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. but he was no Prophet. <hi>David</hi> was a King and Prophet, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. but he was no Prieſt. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was a Prieſt and a Prophet, but he was no King. But all believers are ſo advanced in the truth; they are Kings, and Prieſts and Prophets, all three as Chriſt is; and ſo they have the ſame glory that Chriſt receives from God the Father.</p>
                  <p>The Son, as Man, receives much glory from the Father, as by the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Offices which he hath received him to, ſo by the gifts and graces and abilities which he hath endued him with, for the diſcharge and execution of thoſe Offices.</p>
                  <p>The ſelf ſame honour do believers receive in ſome degree from Chriſt again. As God the Father hath annointed him with the Holy Ghoſt and power, thereby enabling him to be an al-ſufficient King and Prieſt and Prophet to his people; ſo God the Son hath given down ſome part of his annointing to believers, by which he hath enabled them to all thoſe Offices to which he hath aſſumed them with himſelf: It runs down from him the Head to the skirts of his Garment: And hence, ſaith the Apoſtle,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:46169:260"/>
ſpeaking to believers, <hi>ye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have an unction from the Holy One,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. Chriſt hath an unction from the Father, yea from Chriſt. Jeſus Chriſt immediately from the Father; ye me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in, and by, and through Chriſt. Indeed, my Brethren, all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers partake with Chriſt in this anointing of the Spirit. He ſuffered no man to do them wrong, but reproved even Kings for their ſakes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi> Pſal. 105.15. But who were theſe anointed, you will ask me? They were not Kings as ſome expound it: for God reproved Kings for their ſakes, ſaying, <hi>Touch not my anointed.</hi> But they were the Lords people, as you may eaſily perceive, if you ſurvey the ſcope of that place. And hence the Prophet having ſaid, <hi>God, even thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> he adds immediately <hi>above thy fellows,</hi> Pſal. 45.7. ſo that Chriſt hath his fellows in the unction, although not in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the unction: All believers ſhare with him, though they do not ſhare like him. And if they be his fellows in the unction, they muſt be his fellows too in the honour of the unction. They are partakers with him in the ſelf ſame glory, which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this time I ſuppoſe the point is cleared; the ſelf ſame glory which he receives from God the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It ſatisfies him not to ſhine alone; no, he muſt have believers ſhine with him and ſparkle with him. O what an admirable thing is this, that Chriſt ſhould have ſuch ſingular regard to poor wretches! His glory is the thing which he is moſt tender of, which he is lotheſt to forego: And yet he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, you ſee, to part with this to true believers, to give them of his own allowance from the Father.

               <p>AND thus far of the Second Argument with which our Saviour proſecutes his ſuit to God the Father, that believers might be one; Which hath been taken from the end at which he aimed, in giving them the glory which he had received from God the Father: and this was <hi>that they might be one. The glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one even as we are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third comes now in order to be handled: And it is taken from the end of Chriſts inhabitation in believers, and of the Fathers inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in himſelf, and this is alſo <hi>that they may be one,</hi> yea, that they may be perfect in one, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You eaſily diſcern that there is ſome word defective to make the ſenſe compleat in this place, <hi>I in them, and thou in me,</hi> what's that? Either it muſt be I am in them, and thou in me; or I have been in them, and thou in me; Or I ſhall be in them, and thou in me. Either all or one of theſe, or ſome ſuch thing as this is.</p>
               <p>Modern Interpreters take little notice of it, that I can obſerve, and antient Writers ſupply it diverſly, according as their apprehenſions lead them. As far as I can dive into it, it is thus expreſt of purpoſe becauſe our Saviour had no mind to bind it up either to the paſt, the preſent, or the future tenſe, but that it might be left indifferent to them all. If he had ſaid expreſly, I have been in them, and thou in me; this could not have been properly applyed to thoſe which then believed for the preſent, or ſhould believe in after times. If he had ſaid I am in them, and thou in me excluſively, this would not have been properly applyed to them which had believed in former times (ſuppoſing that I am excludeth I have been) or ſhould believe in after times. If he had ſaid, I ſhall he in them, and thou in me, this could not have been properly applyed to them which had believed, or did believe; So that which way ſoever he had fully ſet it down, he had ſeemed to exclude paſt believers, or preſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or future believers, which he had no intent to do; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth purpo ely expreſs it ſo (as I conceive) that he might take in all of them, without exception, <hi>I in them, and thou in me,</hi> to which you may add, have been, are, and ſhall be.</p>
               <p>I have been in them that did believe, I am in them that do believe, and I will be in them that ſhall believe: That ſo they may be all of them by this means cloſely linkt together; One ſpecial end of my inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:46169:261"/>
in believers paſt, preſent, and to come, of this inhabitation in my ſelf, (the Mediator between thee and them) is this, <hi>That they may all be one;</hi> yea, <hi>that they may be perfect in one;</hi> &amp; therefore I beſeech thee Father, let us have our end in this buſineſs. For Explication of the words, we have three things to be enquired and reſolved. Firſt, how Chriſt as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is in true believers. Secondly, how God the Father is in Chriſt as Mediator. Thirdly, how the Mediator being in believers, and God the Fathers being in the Mediator, do ſerve to this great end whereof our Saviour ſpeaks <hi>(viz.)</hi> to make believers one, yea, to make them perfect in one; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> I ſhall be brief upon the former two, becauſe they are more eaſie to be apprehended; and the third indeed is the main thing in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the firſt of theſe, How Chriſt as Mediator is in true believers, I ſuppoſe you are not to ſeek of this. He is in true believers by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; And that not by the Eſſence of the Spirit (for ſo he is no more in one man then another) but by the operation and effects, that is, the gifts and graces of the Spirit; and eſpecially by faith, which is the grace that gives them the denomination of believers; And therefore Chriſt is ſaid expreſly to <hi>dwell in the heart by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for the ſecond thing propoſed, how God the Father is in Chriſt as Mediator; for clearing this you muſt remember that which hath been often hinted, that God the Father all along this prayer of our Saviour, is taken for the whole God-head.</p>
               <p>Now in our Saviours humane Nature the whole Godhead dwells, as the Apoſtle ſhews, Col. 2.9. <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily.</hi> Others are partakers of the Divine Nature, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. but he is partaker of the Divine Eſſence. Others are partakers of the properties of God; but he is partaker of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelf: Others are partakers of the grace of God; but he is partaker of the God of grace; And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith not that in Chriſt dwelleth <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the <hi>Divinity,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, the <hi>Godhead;</hi> And that the fulneſs, all the fulneſs of it; <hi>In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily;</hi> Becauſe it is indeed and really united to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, to the body of Chriſt Jeſus, as I have ſomewhere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted heretofore. You ſee how Chriſt is in believers, and how God is in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now for the third and laſt particular propoſed, how their being each in other doth ſerve to this end mentioned in my Text, <hi>viz.</hi> to make believers one, yea, to make them perfect in one; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one;</hi> This will need a little further Explication.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is in believers by his Spirit, to this end, that they may be one among themſelves, and with the Father and the Son, is very manifeſt in Scripture. But is God in Jeſus Chriſt to this end? Yes, my Beloved, to this end. God had never been in Chriſt as Mediator, but that believers might be joyned to himſelf, in, and by, and through Chriſt. True, my Beloved, the Father had been in the Son as God
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:46169:261"/>
however, ſo he was from everlaſting: But God had never been in Chriſt as Man and Mediator, but for effecting this union: ſo that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world,</hi> the world of believers: ſo I may ſay as well, God was in Chriſt uniting the world, the ſame world of believers to himſelf. Originally they are disjoynted and divided each from other, and which is worſt of all, from God; But down comes Chriſt, and dwells in all of them together, and down comes God and dwells in Chriſt, that ſo they may be all one; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not only that they may be one, but <hi>that they may be perfect in one;</hi> what doth our Saviour mean by that expreſſion, <hi>That they may be perfect in one?</hi> Truly nothing elſe but this, as I conceive, that they may ſo be one, that there may be a perfect union. There is a two-fold perfection, a perfection of parts, and a perfection of degrees. The firſt of theſe is ſpecially intended here, that there may be a perfect union in regard of parts, that is, that all the parts that ſhould be joyned may be joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Therefore am I in all of them, ſaith Chriſt here, <hi>and thou in me</hi> that am in all of them; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in one;</hi> that there may be ſuch a union, to which no part that ſhould be joyned is wanting, ſo that there can be nothing added to it (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of parts at leaſt) to make it more conſummate and compleat.</p>
               <p>If I were not in them (though they were never ſo indiſſolubly joyned among themſelves) that would not be a perfect union; for there would be Chriſt wanting. If thou wer't not in me as Mediator (though I were never ſo indiſſolubly joyned to them) that would not be a perfect union neither; for there would be God wanting. And therefore <hi>I in them</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) I have been in them that did believe, I am in them that do believe, and I will be in them that ſhall believe to the end of the world. <hi>And thou in me:</hi> thou haſt been, art, and wilt be ſtill in me; <hi>that they may be perfect in one;</hi> That they may be ſo one, that there may be a perfect union.</p>
               <p>You ſee the meaning of the words, as far as I have attained. There might be many things obſerved, which have been divers times inſiſted on from other places. The doctrine proper to the Text is this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That the perfection of believers union ſtands in this, that even as they are one among themſelves, ſo God and Chriſt, or God in Chriſt is one with them. This is that which makes it perfect.</head>
                  <p>There are three things required, you ſee, to this perfection, and all of them apparently ſuggeſted in the Doctrine and the Text. Firſt, Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with Chriſt, being in Chriſt as Mediator, <hi>thou in me.</hi> Secondly, Chriſts being one with true believers, being in believers, <hi>I in them.</hi> Thirdly, believers being one among themſelves, or each with other, <hi>that they may be one:</hi> And when all theſe are joyned together, then there is a pefect union, perfect in regard of parts; there can be nothing added to it. <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="478" facs="tcp:46169:262"/>For clearing of this, my Brethren, you muſt know that it hath been the project and deſign of God from everlaſting, that all believers ſhall be joyned among themſelves, and joyned to Chriſt as Mediator, and in and through Chriſt as Mediator, to himſelf: That Chriſt who is the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle party between God and men, God in Heaven, and men on earth, ſhould reconcile, and reconciling joyn things in heaven and earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he ſhould gather into one all things in heaven and earth together in himſelf,</hi> Epheſ. 1.10. So that till all theſe things be joyned together, it cannot be a perfect union, becauſe all things are not united, that are appointed to be joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſhall a little touch upon them in their order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there may be a perfect union, perfect in regard of parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers muſt be joyned together all of them among themſelves: As long as one believer by Election, is without, and is not gathered in to Jeſus Chriſt (for in him they are knit together) it is not a perfect union, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a member wanting. The body myſtical remains imperfect, in regard of integrals, as the Holy Ghoſt inſinuates, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. And hence (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we without them cannot be made perfect,</hi> Heb. 11. <hi>ult.</hi> We without them, are members, in a ſenſe, of an incompleat body: But when all are once come in, when all, both Jews and Gentiles come in the unity of the Faith, unto the knowledge of the Son of God, then he is a perfect man (conceive it in his myſtical Body) then is <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> And therefore ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I in them, that they may be perfect in one:</hi> As I have been in them that did believe, and as I am in them that do believe, ſo I will be in them, in all of them that ſhall believe to the end of the world. And of theſe laſt eſpecially he ſpeaks, as is apparent by the ſcope; <hi>Neither pray I for theſe only,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, (for theſe only that believe) <hi>but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word; for them,</hi> and all of them; <hi>I in them,</hi> in all of them; as I have been &amp; am in all that do believe, ſo I will be in all that ſhall believe, even to the worlds end: That all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers being joyned together, paſt, preſent, and to come, there may be a perfect union; <hi>That they may be perfect in one,</hi> That is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That there may be a perfect union: as believers muſt be joyned together, all of them among themſelves: ſo Chriſt muſt be united to them all; he muſt be in all of them, as you have it in my Text; <hi>For God hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church,</hi> Epheſ. 1.22. over all things of the Church, or that are members of the Church; And it is the Fathers pleaſure which he hath purpoſed in himſelf, <hi>That in the diſpenſation of the fulneſs of time, he might gather together in one, all things in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.10. ſo that if all believers could be gathered into one among themſelves, and not into one in Chriſt, that would not be a perfect union, becauſe they are appointed to be one in him; If all the members of the body myſtical, could be compleatly joyned among themſelves, and not united unto Chriſt their Head, that would not be a perfect union, becauſe God hath appointed him, and given him to be their Head: The joyning of the members all together, you will ſay, will make but an unperfect and a maimed body, unleſs the Head be joyned to them.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="479" facs="tcp:46169:262"/>3. That there may be a perfect union, as believers muſt be one among themſelves, and Chriſt muſt be one with them: ſo God muſt be one with Chriſt, and in and through Chriſt with them. I mean with Chriſt as Head and Mediator of the Church. Indeed the end for which Chriſt took upon him the Office of a Mediator, was to joyn God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who were divided by the fall: Therefore God ſent him down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that he might be in Chriſt <hi>reconciling the world unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.19. Now ſuppoſe Chriſt could reconcile believers each to other, ſuppoſe that he could reconcile them and unite them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as man: if he could not reconcile them and unite them unto God, this were an unperfect union, there were a great defect in it. Where God, my Brethren, is left out, it is a very poor conjunction: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is in Chriſt reconciling the world of believers, that while Chriſt reconciles them to himſelf, he may <hi>eadem opera</hi> reconcile them unto God, who is in him, that ſo the union may be perfect, and there may be nothing wanting, as you have it in my Text; <hi>I in them, and thou in me, thae they may be perfect in one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, is it ſo that the perfection of believers union ſtands in this, that <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> even as they are one among themſelves, ſo God and Chriſt, or God in Chriſt is one with them? Then firſt it ſerves to let us ſee, how faulty and defective the union of the men of this world is. True, many of them are knit together in a knot, they are confederate together, they have all <hi>one mind,</hi> as the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.13. they ſeem to be as firmly joyned together in a bond of love, as it is poſſible for men to be. But God and Chriſt are not united with them, they are out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: Nay my Beloved, they are ſo far from being one with them, that indeed they are againſt them. This is a moſt unhappy and accurſed union. I wiſh all ſuch would think upon it, who are as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> brethren in iniquity, who are confederate againſt God, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.5. who ſet themſelves and take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. who combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, to oppoſe the truths of God, the ways of God, the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, the glory of God, to do ſuch things as are contrary to God. Is God and Chriſt in their confederation? Do God and Chriſt joyn with them, and combine together with them? They are all one among themſelves; touch one and touch all: but is God and Chriſt one with them? Why, they are againſt God, and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God is not with them, but againſt them, and that is a ſad union.</p>
                  <p>The peace, and friendſhip, and confederacy of ſuch, is like the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of iron, braſs and clay together, that will by no means ſoder or unite; The knot will certainly untie at laſt, the union will diſſolve, if God and Chriſt be not engaged in it: And as the Hebrews note of the name of man and wife, <hi>Iſh,</hi> and <hi>Iſhah,</hi> that if you take away the letters <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap> which make the Name of God, there remains nothing elſe but <hi>Eſh,</hi> and that is fire the fire of diſcord and diſſention: So certainly if God be out of any union, yea let it be as near as that of man and wife, which is one of the neareſt in the world, there will be fire among the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:46169:263"/>
parties to it, the fire of jealouſie and rage, that will devour them and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in the end: And it will prove like the unhappy combination between <hi>Abimelech</hi> and them of <hi>Shechem,</hi> concerning which the Holy Ghoſt foreſhewed, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.20. that <hi>fire</hi> ſhould come <hi>out</hi> of Abimelech <hi>and devour the men of</hi> Shechem, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Millo; And <hi>fire</hi> ſhould <hi>come out from the men of,</hi> Shechem, <hi>and the houſe of</hi> Millo, <hi>and devour</hi> Abimilech.</p>

                  <p>And thus of the Second Argument with which our Saviour proſecutes his ſuit, which hath been taken from the end at which he aimed in giving them the glory which he had received from God the Father.</p>

                     </label> what a ſtumbling block it is to worldly men, when there are ſuch perpetual rents and breaches, and diſcords and diviſions between thoſe who profeſs themſelves to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, when they obſerve them to be always wrangling and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one againſt another. Why, they conclude from hence, that certainly God doth not love them, nor any ſuch as they are. Or if he did, he would unite them, and ſweetly knit their hearts together: he would not ſuffer them to live in ſuch a bitter and uncomfortable and unquiet way: No, out of queſtion, ſaith the world, this cannot be the company of men whom God loves, and whom he bears ſuch dear affection to above the reſt, what ever their pretences be; and therefore we will never joyn with them. Whereas if there were nothing elſe but heavenly and holy unity and peace among them, the world would know that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and look upon them as the moſt deſirable ſociety of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple under heaven. But this I do but glance at in my paſſage by. The thing that I intend to faſten and inſiſt upon, is the compariſon our Saviour hints between his Fathers love to true believers and himſelf: By which he intimates it to be much one; For if you mark it well, our Saviour ſaith not only, <hi>That the world may know that thou haſt loved them;</hi> but that <hi>thou haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me.</hi> This out of queſtion is a truth in ſome ſenſe, or elſe he would not have the world to know it; How it muſt be underſtood, I ſhall ſhew you by and by; In the mean time the point is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That God the Father loves believers, even as he loves Chriſt himſelf.</head>
                  <p>This is much, I muſt acknowledge: And yet you ſee it is the clear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs aſſertion of the Text; <hi>Thou haſt loved them,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>even as thou haſt loved me.</hi> To make way to the opening of it, this muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as a thing to be fore-known, that Chriſt muſt here be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as Man and Mediator of the Church: ſo he hath been conſidered all along this prayer. Now under this conſideration, the Father loves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, as he loves him.</p>
                  <p>But you will ask me, How, as he doth him? what is the ſenſe of that expreſſion? there lies the weight of all indeed, and therefore I ſhall lay it open to you in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God the Father loves believers as really and truly, as he loves Chriſt; as he hath loved Chriſt, ſo he hath alſo loved them. He hath not loved Chriſt and not them, but he hath loved Chriſt and them. The one of them as well, that is, as truly as the other. And even as all the love which he declares to Jeſus Chriſt is real, and from the very heart-root, (if I might expreſs it ſo) ſo all the love which he diſcovers to believers is of the very ſame ſtamp. It is a love without diſſimulation, in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects as high and dear, and cordial, as it ſeems to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God the Father loves believers everlaſtingly, even as he loves Chriſt. And everlaſtingly he loves them upon both hands, <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and <hi>à parte poſt, from everlaſting to everlaſting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, he loves believers from everlaſting, even as he loves Chriſt; for as the time cannot be mentioned (look back as far as you are able) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Father did not love the Son; ſo neither can the time be mentioned, wherein he did not love believers. You know Election was from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, and therefore love muſt be from everlaſting too, which is indeed the Cauſe and Fountain of Election, as Epheſ. 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to be his children in Chriſt Jeſus according to the good pleaſure of his will:</hi> You ſee Election flows from the good pleaſure of the will of God, that is, not only from that pleaſure of his will which in it ſelf is good; for ſo doth Reprobation too; but from the pleaſure of his will which is good to us his creatures. It iſſues from his love, that is, his free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved favour: So that you ſee he bears good will to true believers, even in the inſtant of Election, which is from all Eternity, and ſo by conſequence, before they have a being in the world. And this he doth in Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. he chooſes us in Chriſt. In the firſt place he chooſes Chriſt, and then he chooſes us in Chriſt. He loves and chooſes him firſt, as Man and Mediator of the Church, and then he loves and chooſes us in him, with the ſame love with which he loves him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God the Father loves believers to everlaſting, even as he doth love Chriſt; as he doth never ceaſe to love Chriſt, ſo he doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſe to love them: His love to them is like his love to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:46169:264"/>
immutable, he never alters it, nor takes it off again. <hi>The Mountains may depart, and the Hills may be removed, but his kindneſs ſhall not depart from his people: neither ſhall the Covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy upon thee,</hi> Iſa. 54.10. No, <hi>it is an everlaſting kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ver. 8. <hi>an everlaſting love,</hi> Jer. 31.3. <hi>A mercy that endures for ever,</hi> Pſal. 106. So that as he loveth Chriſt from the beginning to the end, ſo he loves believers too; He loveth them in this reſpect even as he loveth him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But hath not God been very angry,</hi>

                     </label> 
                     <hi>and diſpleaſed with thoſe whom he hath ſeemed to love in former times? have they not moſt bitterly complained of it? as the Church,</hi> Lament 5. ult. <hi>where ſhe concludeth her diſcourſe though not her miſery with this wofull Epilogue,</hi> But thou haſt utterly rejected us, thou art very wrath againſt us. <hi>And how then ſhall we take it for a truth, that God doth never ceaſe to love believers, as he doth never ceaſe to love Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, the Lord is many times offended with believers,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> as he was with Chriſt himſelf. He was offended with our Saviour for believers ſins: he is offended with believers, for their own ſins. Iniquity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he finds it, whether by imputation, or commiſſion, makes him angry.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt know my brethren, that it is one thing to be angry with a perſon, and another thing to hate him. Its true indeed that hatred can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with love, for it deſireth the not being of the object of it: but anger may conſiſt with it. And even as we are angry many times with thoſe we love beſt, and who are infinitely dear to us, ſo God was angry with his deareſt Son, and he is angry with his deareſt Saints, and with his beſt beloved people: and yet his love is firm, and conſtant, and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them notwithſtanding, as will appear if you conſider, Firſt the ſhortneſs, Secondly the fruits of this anger. Firſt, Gods anger with his people is no laſting anger. There is ſo great a mixture of love and kindneſs and compaſſion in it, that it is overcome again upon a ſuddain, it is very quickly gone. Indeed his anger to the wicked, is an anger like his love to his people, everlaſting: They are a people with whom the Lord is angry for ever. But his anger to his people is but ſhort: It is but little, and that little is nothing, it is but for a moment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.8. and that is recompenſed with everlaſting kindneſs too. <hi>In a little wrath have I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſs will I have mercy en thee.</hi> Its true that <hi>David</hi> ſaid in his diſtreſs, that God had caſt him off, and that his love and mercy was clean gone for ever. But he corrects himſelf again in his adviſed and deliberate thoughts, and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly confeſſes that he ſpake the former in his haſte, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. and that the latter was his infirmity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10. Secondly, as for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the effects of Gods anger are ſuch as reliſh ſtrongly of his love to his people: They are not ſuch as he is wont to ſhew on reprobates and veſſels of wrath: They are not rigorous puniſhments to ſatisfie his juſtice, but loving chaſtiſements to hinder and prevent the execution of it. For when they are afflicted, they are (not puniſhed in propriety of ſpeech, but) chaſtned, and that to this end, that they may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:46169:265"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. They are not ſuch as fit them for deſtruction and border on damnation, as thoſe which he inflicteth on the wicked, ſuch as are given up to ſtrong deluſions, and to vile affections, and leave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the hardneſs of their hearts to walk according to their own counſels; but ſuch as make them fit for the inheritance with Saints in light, <hi>and work out for them, a far more exceeding and tranſcendent weight of glory.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God the Father loves believers infinitely, even as he doth love Chriſt; his love is like himſelf, nay indeed it is himſelf; for whatſoever is affirmed of God, is God; And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 John 4.16. ſo that if any ask Whether God love believers as much as he loves Chriſt? I anſwer, there are no degrees in that which is infinite. He loves believers out of meaſure, beyond meaſure, and juſt ſo he loves Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there are degrees in the effects and declaration of the love of God; and this way it is certain, God hath ſhewed more love to Chriſt then he doth to true believers; and yet they ſhare together with him in moſt of theſe expreſſions of his love to him; They ſhare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him in his grace; <hi>of his fulneſs they receive, and grace for grace;</hi> They ſhare together with him in his glory, as I ſhewed you very lately; And as his glory is eternal, ſo is theirs, <hi>an exceeding and an eternall weight of glory.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> God the Father loves believers under the ſame relations that he loves Chriſt and ſo in that reſpect it is the ſame love.

Doth he love Chriſt as his ſervant? ſo he loves believers too. Doth he love Chriſt as his Son? ſo he loves believers too. Nay to go beyond Relations, doth he love Chriſt as himſelf, becauſe he is one with him? ſo he loves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers too, for they are one with him in Chriſt.

Indeed my brethren, did he love them as diſtant and ſeparate from Chriſt, then he might love them with another kind of love. But ſince he loves them as in Chriſt, and ſo loves Chriſt and them as one together; (not aſunder, but together) both muſt have the ſame love. As he that loves his friend, cannot diſtinguiſh of the love he bears the head, and the remainder of the body; ſo Chriſt the head and Chriſt the body (as the Church is called with Chriſt) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. are both involved and wrapt up together in the ſame love. He loves them not aſunder but together, and therefore certainly, he doth not love them differently (as to the kind of the affection) but alike. Chriſt is his <hi>beloved Son in whom he is well pleaſed;</hi> not with whom he is well pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in whom he is well pleaſed with all that are in him, and that are members of his body.

Chriſt to them; in the firſt place he love Chriſt, and then he loves them through Chriſt; ſo that is the ſame (for kind at leaſt) wherewithall he loves Chriſt.

               <p>AND thus far we came on the laſt occaſion, by way of explication of the Point. Proceed we now to the Application of it, according to the branches of the explication in their order.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that God the Father loves believers as really and truly as he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> loves Chriſt? This then ſhould teach us in the firſt place, to depend upon him in all caſes and not to doubt him, or diſtruſt him, who is true and reall to us. Its that which we are very ſubject to, when we are brought to ſtreights and difficulties and diſtreſſes, our hearts are ſhaken preſently, and our faith in God fails; we are affraid that God will ſerve us as unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friends are wont to do, when the time of tryal comes; That he will leave us ſuccourleſs in our diſtreſſes. Oh, my beloved, I beſeech you take heed how you wrong God, how you give way to one ſuſpicious thought of him, who is ſo real in his love to you. It is an injury of which he cannot chooſe but be infinitely tender, and that the rather and the more, becauſe his heart is ſo unfeignedly endeared to us. As friends who love us tenderly, if we be alwayes jealous of them, it troubles them exceedingly, they know not how to take it at our hands; ſo do but think how grievous it will be to God (who loves us as he doth his own Son) to be ſuſpected ſtill on all occaſions, and to have his love queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. And therefore ſeeing God is ſuch a faithfull friend, let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves, and all our wayes to him, and let us caſt our ſelves upon him without fear in all caſes; Seeing he loves us really, let us truſt him perfectly: And let us ſo behave our ſelves in all conditions, that we may make it to appear that we rely upon him fully without the leaſt ſuſpition of his love to us.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that God the Father loves believers as really and truly as he <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> loves Chriſt? This then ſhould teach us in the ſecond place to love him truly and really again: To be (as far as it is poſſible) as undiſſembled and ſincere and cordial in our love to him, as he is in his love to us. Oh, my beloved, let us not anſwer true love with feigned love, nor real with
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:46169:266"/>
pretended love; that would be an ill requital. We all profeſs a great deal of affection to the Lord, we ſay we love him: but if he ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us, and ſift us man by man, as once our Saviour did <hi>Peter, Loveſt thou me?</hi> doſt thou love me? doſt thou indeed? could we reply with him <hi>Oh Lord thou knoweſt that we love thee;</hi> Thou knoweſt that our hearts are right to thee. If God ſhould ask us, as <hi>Jehu</hi> did <hi>Jehonadab,</hi> 2 Kings 10.25. <hi>Is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart?</hi> can you reply, as he? <hi>It is.</hi> So you may think indeed, and yet you may decieve your own ſouls. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome who love the Lord in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.24. by which he intimates that there are ſome who do not ſo, who love him hypocritically, not ſincerely; whoſe love to God is like the love of many to their brethren, in word and in ſhew, not in deed and in truth: and therefore it concerns us to examine whether the love we bear to God, be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>without diſsimulation,</hi> yea or no, as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.9. And thus far of the Application of the Point, in reference to the firſt branch of the Explication of it: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we to the ſecond.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Doth God the Father love believers everlaſtingly, even as he loves Chriſt? this then may cheer and comfort up the hearts of all believers, who though they have had ſweet experience of the love of God to them, yet are inclinable to fear that it may be withdrawn again from them. And ſurely there are many ſuch, who even waſte and pine away themſelves in ſuch perplexed thoughts as theſe are; Oh they ſhall never perſevere and continue to the end, they ſhall fall away at laſt from Gods favour, and ſo they ſhall be loſt for ever. Now I beſeech you, quiet and ſecure your ſelves in this particular; the Lord that hath begun to love you, will perſiſt to love you on to all eternity; as he hath loved you from the beginning, ſo he will ſurely love you to the end. As he hath loved you from everlaſting, ſo he will love you to everlaſting, even as he loves Chriſt. When he gives over loving Chriſt, then and not till then, my brethren he will give over loving you; when he withdraws his heart from Chriſt, the darling of his own boſome, he will withdraw his heart from you too. Believe it, Jeſus Chriſt and you muſt fare alike in this reſpect, you muſt be hated or be loved together.</p>
               <p>And therefore do not fear of falling from the love of God, though you have many failings, many imperfections in you; do not doubt that they will cauſe the Lord to hate you. No, no, the love of God is large enough to cover a multitude of them, <hi>and none of them ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.39. Obſerve it well, it is a love in Jeſus Chriſt; he loveth us in loving Chriſt, as being part of Chriſt; we are involved and wrapt up together with him in the ſame love: ſo that if our infirmities ſhould ſeparate us from the love of God, they muſt ſeparate Chriſt with us. If God and we part, God and Chriſt muſt part too. Oh think on this, my brethren, when your fears of loſing Gods favour are moſt prevailing with you, and have greateſt power upon you. This take for all, and reſt upon it, he can no ſooner ceaſe to love you, then you can ceaſe to love Chriſt.</p>

                  <pb n="487" facs="tcp:46169:266"/>Doth God the Father love believers infinitely even as he loves Chriſt?<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Oh then, what may you not expect from ſuch love as this is? A love that hath no bounds, no meaſures. What will not God do for you, in all conditions and in all caſes? what will not God give you? what will not God forgive you? what can you want, if God love you in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Let your hearts dwell upon the meditation of it, eſpecially when you are in trouble.</p>
               <p>When penal miſeries are deſperate and extream, when they are very ſore upon you, that you know not what to do, Think with your ſelves, Is it a likely thing that God will ſuffer you to periſh or miſcarry? the God that loves you infinitely even as he loves Chriſt himſelf? Indeed if he did love you only with an ordinary love, you had ſome colour then to doubt, that he might be regardleſs of you. But ſince he loves you ſo unmeaſurably, as he doth, how can you think that he will ſtand and ſee you ſink away to ruine, and not ſtretch out his hand to ſave you? Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt were in your caſe (if it were to be ſuppoſed) that he were brought to ſuch an exigent as you are, how tender would the Father be of him? how would his bowels yearn upon him? how would he haſten to relieve him? What is it thou, ſaith God, that are brought to ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs? and art thou likely to be ruined and undone? what thou my dear and pleaſant child, my own beloved ſon? Alas, I pitty thee, I melt upon thee, I will help thee preſently, I will not ſee thee to continue long in ſuch miſery as this is. Why my beloved, juſt as God would deal with Chriſt in ſuch a caſe, even ſo will he deal with you; for he loves you, even as he loveth him.</p>
               <p>So when your ſins lie heavy on you, and you are even afraid that God will never pardon you, your provocations are ſo many and ſo great, you vex him every day, and every hour without ceaſing: you do not give him any breathing time: and therefore you are apt to think ſometimes, his patience will be out at laſt, and you ſhall pay for all together. Indeed my brethren, if his love were but as the love of man, you had ground enough to fear it. For who is able alwayes to forgive injuries without number, and without meaſure? But ſince his love is infinite, and there is no end of it, it cannot be too narrow, and too ſcant for you. What may you not expect from an infinite love? Oh my beloved, I beſeech you, do not limit it, do not ſet bounds to it: do not think thus far the love of God may cauſe him to forbear us, and forgive us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this it will not go. Ah my beloved, if you be humble and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſouls, it is a bottomleſs and boundleſs love to you: it will go beyond all that you can think, further then you are able to imagine. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not caſt away your confidence, but roll your ſelves on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable love of God in all caſes. Your ſins are finite: that is infinite: your ſins have limits: that hath none.</p>

The love of God to them is like to that he bears to Chriſt, under all theſe three relations. And this involveth

Then ſurely he will never caſt them off again, as he will never caſt off Chriſt. There are ſome whom God chooſes out of a common love, to common priviledges and advancements, whom in the iſſue he rejects again: he repents that he hath choſen them to ſuch a dignity, place, and office, and ſo he even caſts them off again. And thus he dealt you know with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> But he choſe Chriſt out of a ſpecial and peculiar love, never to be reverſed again. And juſt ſo he choſe us in and by and through Chriſt, out of the very ſame love, and with the very ſame intentions (in reference to revocation) that he choſe Chriſt. And what will God caſt away his people, whom he hath foreknown from everlaſting? whom he hath choſen in his Son Chriſt, <hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world was laid,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. No, no; his choice of us, is as unalterable as his choice of Chriſt himſelf. And when he caſts away Chriſt, then and not till then (my brethren,) will he caſt away us.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Doth God the Father love believers as his ſervants, even as he loves Chriſt? Then ſurely he will deal with us in this regard, much as he dealt with Chriſt, as I ſhall ſhew you in a few particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will uphold us, as he did uphold Chriſt. A Maſter will uphold his ſervant in any buſineſs or employment that he ſetteth him about: Eſpecially a ſervant that he loves. So did God uphold Chriſt, and he ſeems to glory in it, and to call us to obſerve it, Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Behold my Servant whom I uphold;</hi> I am reſolved to bear him out, meddle with him he that dare. Indeed when the appointed time was come, he gave him up to ſuffer what he had deſigned him to. But in the interim, he bore him out, ſo that no projects, no attempts could take againſt him; they could not ſeize upon him, they could not hurt him (ſaith the Goſpel ſtory) <hi>becauſe his hour was not yet come.</hi> Even ſo will God uphold us, untill our hour be come too. For we are ſervants whom he loves even as he loved Chriſt. And as he is a loving, ſo he is an al-ſufficient and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Maſter, as he ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he took him to be a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-ſervant to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. And therefore he will be not only a reward, but a ſhield to his ſervants; <hi>a ſhield and an exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> as his own expreſſion is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. A reward for their ſalvation, and a ſhield for their protection.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God will aſſiſt us in his ſervice, as he did aſſiſt Chriſt. Chriſt had a piece of work you know in hand that was very difficult, ſo <hi>that he ſweat,</hi> and that not ordinary ſweat, but <hi>drops of blood trickling down upon the earth.</hi> Yea, more then ſo, <hi>he fainted,</hi> while he was about it: But God his Maſter that employed him, took a ſpecial care of him, and ſent <hi>an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel down from heaven</hi> of purpoſe <hi>to comfort him, and ſtrengthen him,</hi> Luke 22.43. And when as man he feared how he ſhould hold out and how he ſhould go through with the buſineſs (as to any ſelf ſufficiency as a Creature) and ſo wept and cried to God, he had a very ſweet return as you may ſee, Heb. 5.7. <hi>When in the dayes of his fleſh he had offered up
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:46169:267"/>
prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and tears to him that was able to ſave him, he was heard in that he feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Juſt ſo doth God ſupport us in the work he calls us to; for we are ſervants whom he loves, even as he loved Chriſt. If he perceive the ſervice that we have in hand, to be too difficult and hard for us, then in comes God, and puts his own hand to the work. What, canſt thou not go through with it? Come let me help thee, ſaith the Lord. It is obſerved of the Levites, <hi>that God helped them,</hi> 1 Chron. 15.26. And the Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi> Rom. 8.26. he ſtands againſt us, and bears up the burthen with us. So that the weakeſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Lord need not fear the hardeſt ſervice, or the heavieſt burthen, when he hath ſuch a one to help him, and when thoſe everlaſting arms are underneath him, as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.27. What ſaid the Lord to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was hard beſtead, and when he was about to faint? <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> And this made <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me,</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Out of this love, God will reward us for the ſervice that he enables us to do, as he did reward Chriſt. As ſoon as he had done his work, he had his wages down upon the nail, for he was heard in that prayer, John 15.4. <hi>I have glorified thee upon earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do: and now Oh Father glorifie me with thy ſelf.</hi> And ſo as ſoon as we have ended and diſpatched the buſineſs that God hath put into our hands, we ſhall receive our own reward according to our own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. <hi>Having had the fruit to holineſs, we ſhall receive the end eternal life. If we be faithfull to the death, we ſhall receive the Crown of life,</hi> Apoc. 2.10. If we continue in the Vineyard to the Evening, we ſhall have our penny. If we hold out to the period of our lives, when we ſhall come to dye, we may conclude with God, as Chriſt doth in the forealledged place, <hi>We have glorified thee on earth, we have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt us to do: and now O Father glorifie us with thy ſelf;</hi> and we may ſing our dying Song with the Apoſtle, 1 Tim. 4.7. <hi>We have fought a good fight, we have finiſhed our Courſe: henceforth there is laid up for us a Crown of righteouſneſs which God the righteous Judge will give us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doth God the Father love believers as his Children, even as he loves Chriſt? doth he affect them under that relation too, and that as he doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſt? Then ſurely he will ſhew him ſelf a loving Father to them as he doth to Chriſt, and that eſpecially in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He will hear them as he doth hear Chriſt. You know it is but ask and have, with Chriſt. <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> ſaith God the Father to our Saviour, Pſa. 2.6. <hi>this day I have begotten thee.</hi> And what follows? <hi>Ask of me and I will give thee.</hi> And this is that which Chriſt himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges, John 11.42. <hi>Father, I thank thee becauſe thou haſt heard me.</hi> Yea ſo he might in that particular, and yet he might deny him in another. But mark what followes preſently, <hi>and I know thou heareſt me alwayes.</hi> Thou art my Father, and I am thy Son, and hence it is that thou art ſo inclinable to hear me, to let me have my own asking. Even ſo will God hear us in every thing that we deſire according to his will, for we are Children alſo whom he loves, even as he loves Chriſt. And therefore as
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:46169:268"/>
it was but ask and have with Chriſt, juſt ſo it is with us too. <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you,</hi> Mat. 7.7. And that becauſe he is our loving Father, as he is Chriſts. <hi>Our heavenly Father will undoubtedly give good things to them that ask him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He will provide for us, as he doth for Chriſt. You know he hath provided well for Chriſt. He is not his Son only, but he is his heir too. Yea, he hath made him <hi>heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1.1. Why juſt ſo he hath done by us, for we are children whom he loves even as he loves Chriſt. As Chriſt is his Son and Heir, ſo <hi>we are heirs of God through Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 4.17. <hi>Joint heirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. Not heirs divided and apart from Chriſt, but joint with Chriſt. And even as Chriſt is heir of all things, ſo we are heirs of all things too. All is ours, and we are Chriſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. A man can have but earth and heaven: and we are heirs to both in Chriſt: <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as we are heirs to earth, ſo we are heirs of heaven too, and that by virtue of our Son-ſhip: we are begotten to it, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 1 Pet. 1.3. <hi>He hath begotten us to an inheritance, &amp;c.</hi> So that the child of God you ſee engroſſeth all: earth is his, and heaven is his, and nothing elſe remains for other men but hell only. Oh the unutterable happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe whom God the Father loves even as he loves Chriſt! he gives his own Son nothing but they have a ſhare with him.</p>
               <p>And thus far of the firſt main thing which Chriſt deſires of God the Father in the behalf of true believers, <hi>that they may be all one:</hi> Which ſuit he proſecutes with many arguments, as you have heard. The ſecond follows now in order to be handled, and this is, that they may be all in one place. They may be one by ſuch an union as our Saviour means (a ſpiritual and a myſtical union) though they be in divers places. But Chriſt is not content with this, you ſee; he will not only have them to be all one, but he will have them alſo to be all in one place, the ſame place where he is. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And here you may take notice with me of theſe two particulars. Firſt, the manner how our Saviour Chriſt propounds this ſuit of his: And then the matter of it, or the ſuit it ſelf. Firſt the manner how our Saviour here propounds this ſuit of his, and that is boldly and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, as you ſee: <hi>Father, I will:</hi> he ſaith not, as in other places, Father, I pray, or I deſire, or I beſeech thee and entreate thee, that it may be thus: but I will have it to be thus. No more but ſo, <hi>Father, I will, that they whom thou haſt given me.</hi> Secondly, And then you have the matter of the ſuit which he propounds, the thing which he will have to be, <hi>That they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me, where I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Begin we with the manner, how our Saviour here propounds this ſuit of his, confidently as I ſaid, <hi>Father, I will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not hence conclude (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did ſometimes againſt the Arrians) the Sons equality with God the Father, becauſe he ſpeaks in ſuch a peremptory manner to him, if I may expreſs it ſo, <hi>Father, I will,</hi> or elſeſaith he, he would have ſpoken in a ſupplicating
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:46169:268"/>
and entreating, not in a willing and commanding way. That Chriſt as God is equal with the Father, is a certain truth, and manifeſtly to be proved from other Scriptures: But certainly it is not to be gathered hence: for in this Chapter all along he ſpeaks as man, and as man he is inferiour to the Father. And therefore uſually before, he ſaith, I pray, or I intreat, he ſpeaks in a ſubmiſſive way, though here he uſes ſuch a term as ſeems to to carry more authority, <hi>Father, I will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſince, he ſpeaks as man and mediator, as that is very evident, we muſt underſtand him here in ſuch a way as is agreeable to Chriſt in that capacity, and under that conſideration. And conſequently that he doth not here imperiouſly require of God the Father: and yet upon the other ſide, he doth ſo expreſs himſelf, as being very confident that he ſhall have his own pleaſure, and that his will ſhall ſurely carry it with God the Father, without any contradiction. If he will it, it is done without any more ado. Father, I will have it ſo, and there's an end. And ſo accordingly the point ſhall be.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The will of Chriſt as Mediator, is as it were a law with God the Father, or Chriſt may have even what he will of God the Father.</head>
                  <p>And therefore praying here that all believers might be together with him in the ſame place, he ſaith no more but this, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am:</hi> And this is that which <hi>Martha</hi> was ſo ſtedfaſtly perſwaded of, that Chriſt was ſure to ſpeed with God in any ſuit that he would make to him: She had no doubt at all concerning this, as you may ſee, John 11.22. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>that whatſoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</hi> Let it be what it will, God will not turn thee off with a denial. And leaſt you ſhould conceive that this was but a groundleſs confidence in her, you ſhall find it ſeconded by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 42. of the very ſame Chapter, which puts it out of all queſtion. If you ſurvey the ſupplications that he made while he was here upon the earth, you ſhall perceive what force they had with God the Father. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves that he was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with him in a weighty buſineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. and what was the event and iſſue of it? he was heard as it is added preſently, no more but ſo, he was granted out of hand. So in another place he prayed for <hi>Peter</hi> in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner, <hi>that his faith might never fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l,</hi> Luke 22.32. that it might not wholly fail, ſo as to be quite loſt, and utterly extinct in him. His faith was ſhaken after this indeed, but it was not overthrown: it fainted, but it did not fail; So that Chriſt had his full deſire in that particular, I ſhall add no more for proof: you ſee the will of Chriſt as Mediator is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there are many Reaſons of it. For,</p>
                  <p>He is the Fathers own Son. And Fathers uſe to be indulgent to their <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Children to let them have their ears, yea and their very hearts too. Our Saviour calls him Father all along this prayer. Indeed he gives him once the attribute of <hi>Holy,</hi> once the attribute of <hi>Righteous Father.</hi> But
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:46169:269"/>
this is ſtill the appellation that he uſes, and from which he never va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If he call him any thing, he calls him Father: And therefore he preſumeth much upon him, becauſe of this relation to him, that he ſhall not be denyed; he is the bolder, while he conſiders he is ſpeaking to a Father, as that is his expreſſion in my Text it ſelf; <hi>Father, I will;</hi> Come, I muſt have my will in this particular, thou muſt not put me off with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal; for I am thine own Son.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> Yet this is not ſufficient that he is a Son: for there are ſons whom fathers will deny in every thing almoſt, becauſe they have deſerved ill of them: and ſo they bear but little love to them. But Chriſt is not ſuch a Son; no, as he is a Son, ſo he is a beloved ſon; it is the Fathers atteſtation of him, Mat. 3.17, <hi>This is my Beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> And that is a ſecond reaſon, why Chriſt may have even what he will of God the Father, becauſe he bears ſuch dear affection to him: And this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated alſo in the Text it ſelf, ſaith Chriſt, in the words mediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which we have even now diſpatched, <hi>thou haſt loved me,</hi> ſaith he; and what follows? <hi>Father I will, q. d.</hi> I know thou will let me have my will, becauſe thou loveſt me.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Yet this is not ſufficient neither, that he is a Son, and a beloved Son too: For there are ſons that are very well beloved, who yet will ask that of their fathers many times, which would be neither beneficial for them to receive, nor honourable for their fathers to beſtow upon them; and God himſelf hath ſome of theſe ſons, who now and then put up their ſupplications and requeſts for that which would be neither good for them to have, nor him to give; and therefore they receive the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that the two Diſciples did, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt is none of thoſe ſons; he never faileth in the leaſt degree, in the matter or the manner of his prayers. He never asketh what he ſhould not ask: he never asketh what he ſhould, in ſuch a manner as he ſhould not. And that is a third reaſon, why he may have even what he will of God the Father, becauſe as he is a Son, and a beloved Son, ſo he is ſuch a Son as never asketh any thing amiſs; he never prays but juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Fathers own will. His will as he is Man and Mediator, agrees in every thing, and all reſpects with the will of God the Father; And therefore while the Father lets our Saviour have his will, he hath his own; and if he ſhould not let him have his will, he ſhould not have his own neither. We that are adopted ſons, are many times miſtaken in the ſupplications that we make to God; we do not ask according to his will; and hence it is, my Brethren, that he doth not always hear us. But Jeſus Chriſt who is the Fathers own begotten Son, is never at a loſs in this reſpect. He never miſſes of conforming his deſires to his Fathers own pleaſure; and hence it is that his Will is a law with God the Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>4</label> And then there is a fourth reaſon, which is more then all the reſt, why Chriſts Will is a Law with God the Father, becauſe indeed he willeth nothing but that which he deſerves of him. If he ſue for any thing as Mediator in the behalf of his people, it is but that which he hath dearly bought and paid for: So that his Father ought not in juſtice to deny him,
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:46169:269"/>
His Interceſſion, as Divines obſerve, is nothing elſe but the preſenting of his merits to the Father. And this is that which makes him bold and confident, as you ſee him in my Text: Father, I will have it thus; That which I ſeek, I have purchaſed with my blood, and therefore let me not be wronged, but let me have what I have paid for. <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am: q. d.</hi> Thou knoweſt that I have bought that place for them, and I have ſatisfied thee for it, to the very utmoſt, and therefore I will have them to be there, and I muſt not be denyed.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my Brethren, that the will of Chriſt is as it were, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>1</label> The firſt ſerves to let us ſee their happineſs who have Chriſt to ſpeak for them. They who have him to be their Interceſſor, and to preſent his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and requeſts for them, are in a very good Condition, for they can want no good thing. They might ſtand begging long enough them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and never ſpeed: But if Chriſt do undertake to plead for them, if he put in a good word for them, all is ended preſently, they have a gracious anſwer out of hand. God may deny them (as I ſhewed you) while they are ſpeaking for themſelves; but if Chriſt ſpeak for them, he can never be denyed; he may have what he will of God the Father. O the the bleſſedneſs of thoſe to whom this glorious priviledge belongs, and who have ſuch a powerful Advocate as Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo, that the will of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why then, if we have any ſuit <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> to make, or any ſupplication to preſent, let us not go directly to the Father, but let us get the Lord Chriſt to ſpeak for us. And then we may be confident that all is ſure. We may be denyed, but he cannot.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhall we make Chriſt to be our Spokeſman, and our Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in all ſupplications that we make to God? I will give you two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt walk by his Rule, the Rule that he would have us guide our prayers and our ſupplications by. We muſt be ſure to put up ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and none but ſuch as are agreeable to his will. For as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not grant the ſuit that is not ſuitable to his will: if we ask any thing according to his will he hears us, otherwiſe he doth not: ſo Chriſt will not take the ſuit that is not ſuitable to his will. And to ſay truth, that is the reaſon why the Father doth not grant it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the Son doth not preſent it and purſue it; for if he do, it never fails of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or ſucceſs. If Chriſt undertake it once, his Father never puts it off with a denyal. His will is as it were a Law with God the Father.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, our Saviour is not ſuch an Advocate as pleads for fees, and undertaketh any thing that any Clyent puts into his hands; No, what he likes, and what he hath a mind to, he purſues and proſecutes with God the Father, and never leaves till he obtain a grant from him; but if he miſlike the ſuit, if it agree not with his mind, or will, he never ſpeaks a word in it, and then it never ſpeeds with God. For as the Father granteth all that Chriſt deſires, ſo he denyeth all in which he doth not ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an Interceſſor. If Chriſt the Mediator do not own it, the Father ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gives aſſent to it. And therefore he muſt be engaged and intereſted in every ſuit we make to God, by framing it agreeably to his will.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="494" facs="tcp:46169:270"/>2. We muſt act by his Spirit, who knows his mind as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. and what will ſurely take and relliſh with him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, if the Spirit draw up the Petition, Chriſt will preſent and follow it, and get it ſigned. But if the Spirit have no hand in it, Chriſt will have none neither. We have two Advocates and Interceſſors to the Father. An Interceſſor or an Advocate within us; an Interceſſor or an Advocate without us: An Interceſſor to plead in us, and to plead by us; and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor to plead for us. In the firſt ſenſe, the Spirit is our Interceſſor, ſo the Apoſtle calls him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20. In the Latter Chriſt only. Now theſe two Advocates or Interceſſors are agreed: you get not one of them without the other. Chriſt will not be your Lawyer, unleſs you make the Spirit your Attorney. And as the Father never grants that which Chriſt doth not preſent and plead before him: So our Saviour never pleads that which the Spirit doth not frame and draw up. If the Petition which you tender be of the Spirits forming in you, Chriſt entertains and urges it without any more ado, and ſo the Father gives aſſent to it.</p>
                  <p>If then you would have Chriſt to be your Advocate, you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him by his Spirit; your Supplications and Petitions muſt be the voyce of his Spirit in your hearts; the Holy Ghoſt muſt raiſe and frame them there: you muſt take heed they be not barely natural deſires, as the Petitions of abundance are, which ſeek for nothing elſe but that which nature craves for, on natural principles, and for natural ends: And that they be not: only the voyce of your own ſpirits, but that they be the voyce of Chriſts ſpirit; and if Chriſts Spirit make you prayers, if he make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion in you with ſighs and groans, Chriſt will make Interceſſion for you, and then the Father will be ſure to hear you: For if he deny you, he muſt deny Chriſt too that pleads for you, and that he never doth, as you have heard. His will is as it were a law with God the Father, he may have what he will of him.</p>

<pb n="495" facs="tcp:46169:270"/>
the will of Chriſt is manifeſted touching this as well as other points of duty. And then compare your prayers with the Rule in all particulars, to ſee whether they agree with it, or diſſent from it; as the Apoſtle ſtirring up the <hi>Romans</hi> to offer up acceptable ſervice to the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. to this end in the following verſe adviſes them to prove and to find out what the will of God is: the ſame advice I give you; See what the will of God and what the will of Chriſt is, and then examine how your prayers ſuit with it: whether they be framed and ordered by your own invention, or by his direction.</p>
               <p>And here you muſt take notice what the will of Chriſt preſcribes touching the preparation to them; the matter, and the manner, and the ends of them; it regulateth all theſe.</p>
               <p>Well then, the firſt thing that you are to do, is to conſider what the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will of Chriſt is in reference to preparation, and how your practice ſuits with it: For you muſt know that Chriſt will have you pray with prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You muſt not ruſh into the preſence of the Lord, like the Horſe into the battel, not remembring where you go, nor what you are about to do. No, you muſt ſet about it ſeriouſly, and with much deliberation: ſo is the rule of Chriſt, Eccleſ. 5.2, 3. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be haſty to utter any thing before the Lord.</hi> Our hearts muſt be prepared to the duty, as the Prophet <hi>Davids</hi> was. And this conſiſts in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things; I will name a few of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our hearts may be prepared, they muſt be purged, they muſt be waſhed and cleanſed from every known ſin. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Zephar, Job</hi> 11.13. which preparation is to prayer, as it is apparent by the following words, <hi>and ſtretch out thine hands towards him.</hi> Well, if thou ſo prepare thy ſelf, what muſt thou do then? Why, <hi>If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away from thee, and let not wickedneſs dwell in thy Tabernacle,</hi> as it is added in the next words. And hence, ſaith <hi>David, If I regard iniquity in my heart,</hi> any known iniquity, if I do not commit it only in my life, but regard it in my heart, my heart is not fit to pray, <hi>the Lord will not hear my prayer,</hi> Pſal. 66.18. The promiſe of acceptance with him, is made to ſuch, and none but ſuch as fear him, ſo far at leaſt as to deſire and to endeavour to depart from evill; <hi>He will fulfil the deſire of ſuch as fear him, he alſo will hear their cry and ſave them,</hi> Pſal. 145.19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That our hearts may be prepared, they muſt be humbled, both in the ſenſe of the tranſcendent Majeſty and Glory of the Lord, and of our unworthineſs. We muſt endeavour to poſſeſs them with an awful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the greatneſs of the Lord, whom we are making our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to, that we may pray in reverence and holy fear, according to the Pſalmiſts exhortation, Pſal. 2.11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear,</hi> ſaith he; and according to his practice and example, Pſal. 5.7. <hi>in thy fear will I worſhip towards thy holy Temple.</hi> And hence the Saints in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their prayers, when they have buckled to the duty, have been wont to ſet the Lord upon the Throne, and there to repreſent him in his greatneſs, by reckoning up his glorious attributes: And then to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and to abaſe themſelves exceedingly before him: That they might bring their hearts by this means to a frame and temper fit for prayer. In
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:46169:271"/>
ſuch a diſpoſition was the heart of the Centurion when he ſought to Chriſt for mercy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.6, 7. He did not think himſelf worthy, that Chriſt ſhould once come under his roof: And ſo the prodigal that ſaid to his Father, <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy ſon,</hi> Luk. 15.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That our hearts may be prepared, they muſt be fixed. They muſt be ſetled upon God, and on the words we utter to him. They muſt not rove and wander up and down, as they are very apt to do. They muſt attend the buſineſs that they are about. In ſuch a diſpoſition was the heart of <hi>David,</hi> when he was about to praiſe the Lord; <hi>My heart is fixed O God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my heart is fixed, I will ſing and give praiſe;</hi> Pſal. 57.7. There hath been much talk of late concerning fixing arms: but ſurely this of fixing hearts is the moſt neceſſary buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That our hearts may be prepared, they muſt be awakened: they are naturally dead and dull, and ſleepy; eſpecially at ſometimes, by means of ſome corporal or ſpiritual diſtemper. They cannot watch to prayer one hour, and though <hi>the ſpirit is ready, yet the fleſh is weak:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt quicken them, and rouſe them up from drowſineſs, before we ſet about the duty; and while we are in the performance of it, we muſt call upon our hearts as <hi>Deborah,</hi> Judg. 5.12. <hi>Awake, awake</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah, <hi>awake awake, utter a ſong.</hi> And as <hi>David</hi> on his Harp, <hi>Awake Harp;</hi> ſo we, awake heart, <hi>I my ſelf will awake early,</hi> Pſal. 108.2. You ſee in brief, the Rule of Chriſt in reference to preparation. Now let us ſee what he preſcribes both for the matter, the manner, and the end of prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for the matter of your prayers, you muſt ſearch the promiſes. You are to pray for nothing, but only what you have a promiſe; for not what you have a mind to, but what you have a promiſe for. It is the buſineſs and the work of prayer to put the promiſes of God in ſuit; not our deſires, but his promiſes. And therefore we muſt ſtudy promiſes, if we would know how to make prayers, or how to judge of prayers after we have made them: If they agree not with the promiſes, they are but raſh and inconſiderate deſires: they are <hi>the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> as they are called, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. And God will never look after them, nor ſhew reſpect to them, as <hi>Elibu</hi> teaches us, Job 35.13. <hi>Surely God will not hear vanity, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Almighty regard it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As for the manner of our prayers, the rule of Chriſt is very large here, and ſo accordingly directions might be copious, both how to form our ſupplications, which we are about to tender, and having tendred them, how to reſolve whether they have been according to the will of Chriſt, or no. I ſhall but touch upon the principal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is in the will of Chriſt that we pray without wrath; for ſo is the expreſs direction, 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>I will therefore that men may pray every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, lifting up pure hands without wrath.</hi> We muſt not come to God with hearts diſtracted and diſturbed with paſſion, but with compoſed, meek and quiet ſpirits. It was the fault of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> who when a certain Town of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> repelled Chriſt, and refuſed to receive him, would in a fit of rage and anger, have prayed for <hi>fire to come down from heaven to conſume them,</hi> Luk. 9.54. And ſo when the malitious enemies of Chriſt, have done his cauſe or people any great miſchief, it
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:46169:271"/>
may be we are ready in a heat to call for vengeance out of heaven upon them. But if we pray in ſuch a manner, we may look for ſuch a cenſure as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had in the fore-alleadged Text, <hi>Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of;</hi> You think it may be you are zealous, but you are very much miſtaken; you are cholerick and angry; you do know not the temper and diſpoſition of your ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Brethren we muſt not go to prayer in a fit of anger, and a pang of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, as it ſeems <hi>Eliah</hi> did, 1 King. 14.4. <hi>It is enough Lord, take away my life, for I am not better then my Fathers:</hi> And as it ſeems Job did, <hi>Job</hi> 6.8. <hi>Oh that I might have my requeſt, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for; Even that it would pleaſe God to deſtroy me, that he would let looſe his hand and cut me off:</hi> And as it is extreamly probable that <hi>Moſes</hi> did when he conceived his burthen was too heavy for him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.10, 15. For it is ſaid he was diſpleaſed, and in that angry mood, he ſaid to God, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou afflicted me?</hi> You ſee he calls the Lord to <hi>coram,</hi> to ſee how he can anſwer his proceedings; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am not able to bear all this alone: And if thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of the way, and do not let me ſee my wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And thus it is apparent <hi>Jonah</hi> did, who being croſt in a <hi>punctilio,</hi> in a point of honour, out of a pettiſh childiſh humor, will go die, God muſt take away his life: We muſt not come to God in ſuch a temper, to empty and diſgorge our choler, and to vent our paſſions to him; No, <hi>Tempus manſuetudinis, eſt tempus orationis.</hi> The time of meekneſs is the time of prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is the will of Chriſt that we pray without doubtings, and this is alſo added in the Text before alledged, 1 Tim. 2.8. <hi>Pray, lifting up pure hands without wrath or doubting.</hi> He would have us come to God with confidence and ſtrong aſſurance, as it beſeemeth thoſe to do who are indeed in Covenant with him. You know a houſhold ſervant, that is in Covenant with his Maſter, cals confidently for his break-faſt, and his din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and his Supper, whereas a beggar or a ſtranger doth not ſo. So he that is in Covenant with the Lord, <hi>ſhould come with boldneſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> relying formerly on the promiſes of God, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>I cryed and I hoped in thy Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.147. Lord, I want faith, give it me; I want patience, let me have it; I find my heart is out of order, joynt it, mend it, unite it to thy ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is for thoſe that are without, and that are ſtrangers to the Lord, that live on nothing elſe but common providence, to come doubtfully to God, when their diſtreſſes force them to his preſence. But if thoſe that are his friends, and that are in Covenant with him, come in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to him, he may juſtly ſay to ſuch, Why, what's the matter that you are ſo ſtrange, and that you are not bold with me, as you have wont to be? you ſhall fare neer a whit the better for coming to me after ſuch a manner. And verily, my Brethren, unleſs we draw nigh to God in faith well grounded on the promiſes, we can have no hopes to ſpeed in our pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. He that would ask any thing of God, ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> chap. 1.6, 7, let him come in faith, nothing doubting. Otherwiſe let him not think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="498" facs="tcp:46169:272"/>3. It is the will of Chriſt that we pray with much zeal, that our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be not formal, cold and drowſie prayers, but that there be ſome heat and fervour in them. You know the prayers of Gods people are compared to <hi>Incenſe,</hi> Pſal. 141.2. And Incenſe ſends up no ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour till the fire come to it. It is the fervent prayer only that is effectual with the Lord, as the Apoſtle teaches us, Jam. 5.16. <hi>The effectual fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.</hi> And hence ſaith <hi>David, Hear me, O Lord,</hi> and why ſo? <hi>I cry with my whole heart,</hi> Pſal. 119.145. ſo runs the promiſe of the Lord to his people, Jer. 29.13. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek and find me when ye ſearch for me with your whole heart.</hi> And thus you ſee in brief what Chriſt preſcribeth for the manner of your prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Now in the laſt place for the end of prayer, that muſt be his glory, we muſt aim at his ends, and not our own. If we ſeek any thing, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, meerly for our own ends, to advance our own credits, or our own profit, we have no aim at all but ſelf in our Petitions: If we would have gifts and graces for no other ends but this, that we may be applauded and obſerved; if we would have wealth and riches in the world for no other end but this, that we may ſtrut and ſwagger, and ſatisfie our own luſts (and ſo accordingly we may conceive of other things) we have cauſe enough to doubt, that Jeſus Chriſt will leave us in ſuch ſuits as theſe are, yea though we be his own people. But if we would have nothing from the Father but in reference to Chriſt and to his glory, if we would have grace, and if we would have outward things that we may ſerve him the better, that we may honour him the more, we have good grounds to hope that Jeſus Chriſt will ſecond us, in ſuch requeſts as theſe are.</p>
               <p>Now he will tell the Father, There is ſuch a ſuit of ſuch a member, ſuch a Saint of mine, I pray thee hearken to it, and diſpatch it out of hand, for it concerneth me aſwell as him: Fain he would have more grace, but I aſſure thee (for I know his heart) it is not to be proud, or to be lifted up himſelf, but to lift up me with it, and to glorifie my name. Poor ſoul he never thinks he gloryfieth me enough, and therefore he would have more ſtrength from thee to do it. Thou ſeeſt how I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in this ſuit of his, and therefore I beſeech thee do not put him off, but anſwer him for my ſake. It is thy great deſign to glorifie me in the world, and if thou wilt but give this Saint of mine more grace, he will give me more glory. Come, let me ſet thy Treaſure open, and give him out a large ſhare, for I my ſelf ſhall be a gainer by it.</p>
               <p>And thus far I have ſhewed you, how we may have Jeſus Chriſt to be our Advocate in our Petitions. We muſt walk by his Rule, and pray according to his Will, as I have laid it open to you, both in relation to the Preparation, and the Supplication, both for the matter, manner, and the end. If thus we do, we may be confident of the good word of Chriſt for us. But what if we fail in this? I anſwer in a word, and ſo an end.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> If we fail in the matter of our prayer, if that be not according to the will of Chriſt, ſuch a Petition and requeſt as this, we may reſolve upon, is laid by.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="499" facs="tcp:46169:272"/>If we fail in the manner of our prayer, either it is a total failing, or a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> gradual failing. If it be a total failing, if we pray without faith, without any faith at all, without zeal, and the like, farewell to the ſucceſs of ſuch petitions.</p>
               <p>If it be but a partial failing, and that failing ſtrived againſt, and prayed againſt, the caſe is very different. By Evangelical allay we do what we deſire to do, in Gods gracious acceptation: We pray in faith, if we deſire to pray in faith: we pray with zeal, if we deſire to pray with zeal: We pray according to the Will of Chriſt, if we deſire to pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of Chriſt, as to the manner of our prayers. And if we pray according to his Will (but in ſuch a ſenſe as this) Chriſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, and God hears. Our Advocate ſtrikes in with us, and begs his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to regard the matter, and not the manner of our prayers. He is an Interceſſor for us to his Father, in reference to both theſe, both to the thing deſired, and the manner of deſiring, that he would give the one, and that he would forgive the other.</p>
               <p>And thus far of the firſt ſort of directions, how to judge whether in the Petitions that we make we walk by the Rule of Chriſt or no. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we to the ſecond ſort, how to determine whither we act by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, or no.</p>
               <p>If in our prayers we act by Chriſts Spirit, there are ſome meaſures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and degrees of fervency and zeal in them. The Holy Ghoſt is frequently compared to fire in Scripture; <hi>He ſhall baptize you</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſpeaking of our Saviour) <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire:</hi> that is, with the Holy Spirit, which is not like water only, but like fire too, in thoſe that are baptized with it; ſo that where the Spirit is, there is an holy heat in thoſe that are partakers of it, which ſhews it ſelf in prayer as in other duties. They are fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord. And though their heat may be allaid and cooled ſometimes, by outward means, like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſt on this fire, yet ſtill there is an inward ſtriving and diſpoſition to be fervent. The Holy Ghoſt within them is like fire to this incenſe: I mean the incenſe of their prayers. And though it may be ſmothered ſometimes that it cannot flame or burn up, either by afflictions, or temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or deſertions, yet it is never utterly extinguiſhed in the Saints. Although there be not flames perhaps, yet there are coals continually on the Altars of their hearts, which though they may be raked in the aſhes now and then, yet at ſome other times they burn amain; Their hearts are hot within them, and the fire kindles,</p>
               <p>If we act by Chriſts Spirit, our prayers are not purely natural, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> deſires. For you muſt know, my Brethren, that a man may pray, yea he may think that he is much aſſiſted by the Spirit in his prayers, when all proceeds from his own Spirit, and all his prayers may be nothing elſe but meerly natural deſires. As when a man perceives himſelf to be in great diſtreſs, and ſees no way or means to be delivered from it, and is convinced and ſatisfied that God can ſave him notwithſtanding this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of danger; In ſuch a caſe (theſe ſuppoſitions being made) he may enlarge himſelf to God in prayer, and yet he may be ſtirred and quickned to it by nothing but his own Spirit, which is naturally car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:46169:273"/>
to the uſe of any means which it conceives may be effectual to ſuch an end as this is: So that this man for all his earneſtneſs, may not act by Chriſts Spirit, but his own: as it is very manifeſt thoſe wretches did, who when they ſaw themſelves invironed round about with dangers, and thought that none but God could help them, cryed vehemently to the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.10. and yet in the ſucceeding verſe it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what they were: They ſhew themſelves in their own colours.</p>
               <p>But when a man is carryed high in prayer upon ſuch grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as his ſpirit naturally is not likely to ſuggeſt, becauſe they do not any way concern him as a natural man: as when upon the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome great diſhonour that will come to God, if ſuch a thing ſhould be denyed, a man is much enlarged and quickned in his prayers; yea, when his prayers are againſt his natural deſires; when he is earneſt with the Lord in ſecret, to help him to pluck out a right eye, or to cut off a right hand, to mortifie, and curſe, and kill thoſe luſts, and thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which naturally are extreamly dear to him, and that upon ſuch grounds and motives, wherein there is no ſelf reſpect: When he ſhall ſeriouſly and ſincerely beg the Lord to give but a little wealth, a little honour, if he perceive that more will do him ſpiritual hurt, that it will puff him up and make him proud as <hi>Agur</hi> did, <hi>Give me not riches, feed me with food convenient for me, left I be full and deny thee, and ſay, Who is the Lord?</hi> this man is like to act by Chriſts Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If we act by Chriſts Spirit in our prayers, we ſtrive moſt for ſpiritual things. What do you think the Spirit of Chriſt will make us long more after earth and earthly things then Chriſt himſelf? that it will make us more importunate for wealth, then grace? more earneſt after tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and worldly bleſſings, then after thoſe <hi>ſpiritual bleſsings in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls them? <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. Is it a likely thing, my Brethren, that the Spirit ſhould make us ſtruggle more for bodily and outward things, then for thoſe things that are more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ſuitable to it, more near to its own nature? I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>David</hi> acted by the Spirit, in that Petition and requeſt of his, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6. <hi>There be many that will ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, any temporal or worldly good; many that look after this: But this is that which I deſire, ſaith he, <hi>Lord, lift upon me the light of thy countenance,</hi> and when thou haſt done this, <hi>Thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart, much more then in the hearts of worldly men when their corn and wine increaſeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> If we act by Chriſts-Spirit, we pray for temporal and worldly things in reference to ſpiritual ends. They that have the Spirit of Chriſt, and they that are devoid of it, do both pray for earthly bleſſings: For there are promiſes of theſe as well as of the other. But now the difference lies in this, both aim not at the ſame ends. He that hath the Spirit of Chriſt deſires theſe outwards bleſſings moderately with ſubmiſſion, that he may ſerve God with them, that he may promote his ends; that he may be the abler inſtrument to help his Church, to ſupport his people, to advance his glory, to appear for his cauſe. Even theſe deſires of his are ſpiritual, although not for the matter of them, at leaſt for the
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:46169:273"/>
end of them. But now my brethren, on the other ſide, he that hath not Chriſts ſpirit deſires theſe outward bleſſings that he may conſume them on his Luſts, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Jam. 4.3. <hi>Ye ask and receive not, becauſe you ask amiſs that you may conſume it upon your luſts;</hi> That you may make proviſion for the fleſh with it, and that it may be oyle to nouriſh and to feed the ſinfull flames that are within you.</p>
               <p>And thus it is my brethren, with a multitude of men: they pray to God for ſome thing to beſtow upon their ſenſual appetite, to ſerve their carnal turns, to ſatisfie their brutiſh and voluptuous pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires: They would be in place and power, that they may raiſe their names and families, that they may ſwell and ſwagger over their inferiours, that they may plague their enemies, and pleaſure thoſe that are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of them. They would have wealth and riches in abundance, that they may ſwimm in full delights, and fare delitiouſly every day. <hi>Agur</hi> meaſures the conveniency or inconveniency of his outward ſtate, as it would fit him more or leſs for Gods ſervice: <hi>Not poverty, leaſt I deny thee; not riches left I forget thee.</hi> But theſe men meaſure it by nothing but their ſenſual appetite: and ſo their prayers ſerve their luſts, and they would have God himſelf to ſerve them too, if they could prevail with him. And are ſuch deſires as theſe, like to be raiſed by the ſpirit of Chriſt? what will the ſpirit ſtir men up to pray for any thing to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh and maintain the fleſh, the carnall part, which is the ſpirits enemy. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> for thoſe two are contrary one to another: And will the ſpirit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſtrive for that which ſhall uphold and feed thoſe luſts againſt which the ſpirit luſteth? Believe it brethren, they that pray for any bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings to maintain their luſts with them, their pride, intemperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do not act by Chriſts ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But you will ask me then, How ſhall we know whether we pray for bleſsings to conſume them on our Luſts? how ſhall we diſcern that? I ſhall give you ſome diſcoveries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. If you will obſerve &amp; deal impartially and freely with your ſelves, you ſhall know it by your thoughts. The end is firſt in the intention, and laſt in execution: and therefore certainly the heart works much upon it. Now my beloved, conſider what runneth often in your thoughts; when you are ſick, and pray for health and continuance of your lives, are your aimes as <hi>Davids</hi> were, <hi>that you may praiſe and glorifie the Lord among the living?</hi> Pſal. 6.5. as <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> were? Loth he was to die, poor man: but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was he ſo averſe from death? <hi>The grave cannot praiſe thee, death cannot celebrate,</hi> Iſa. 38.18. Or do you feed your minds with nothing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſions of the carnal pleaſure and delight and ſatifaction you ſhall have when you recover. So when you pray for outward things, do you entertain your ſpirits with pleaſing dreams of honour and ambition? by this you may diſcover what your aims are.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You ſhall diſcern it by the manner of your prayers, whether you pray for bleſſings to conſume them on your luſts, or no. If ſo, you will be abſolute and peremptory in your prayers. Carnal deſires will make the ſpirit of a man impetuous and impatient of denial. He that aims at
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:46169:274"/>
ſatisfaction of his luſts, will not be at Gods diſpoſal, there will be no ſweet ſubmiſſion to the will of God. No, he muſt have this or that, and he cannot bear a check: as <hi>Rachel</hi> muſt have children or ſhe dies; when once the heart is ſet on any thing that ſerves to feed a ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, whether it be the luſt of the fleſh, or the luſt of the eye, it is violently bent, and it muſt not be denyed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You ſhall diſcover it by the effect, I mean the uſe of thoſe external bleſſings which you pray for: you pray for health, you pray for riches and the like, and you receive them at the hands of God, he gives you the deſire of your hearts in theſe things; Well now conſider with your ſelves what uſe you put them to when you have gotten them, and what bills you bring in. What, ſo much health and ſo much ſtrength beſtowed upon the proſecution of your worldly and ambitious projects and deſigns? ſo much means and ſo much time upon riot and exceſs? <hi>Item,</hi> ſo much upon your pride, and ſo much upon your luſts, and ſo much upon the ſatisfaction of your malice and revenge: ſo much upon Hawks and Hounds, and Whores: but nothing upon God, his Cauſe, or his poor diſtreſſed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Are theſe the bills that you bring in to God? and will you own them in the latter day? Brethren, by your layings out you may diſcover to what intent you have prayed for outward bleſſings, whether to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume them on your Luſts, or no: And if that hath been your end, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hath not been your principle in theſe petitions.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> If we act by Chriſts ſpirit, we keep a conſtant courſe in prayer. We do not pray by fits and ſtarts as <hi>Job</hi> obſerveth of the Hyppocrite, who hath not Chriſts ſpirit, Job 27.10. <hi>Will he delight in the Almighty? will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes call on God?</hi> No, he will be on and off in this duty. Our ſpirits are unconſtant and unſtable, my beloved: but Chriſts ſpirit is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not ſo. And hence it is that they that pray by their own ſpirits, are ſo uncertain in the duty many times. Sometimes their ſpirits ſtir them up to pray, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they do not: Though there be differences in this too: for ſome mens ſpirits naturally are more ready and more fixed then others are: And there may be other things as fear and ſtrong conviction and the like that may hold ſome certain men almoſt to a continued practice of the outward duty; yet it is very rare that he is conſtant who acts by his own ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But now my brethren, he that acts by Chriſts ſpirit, is a ſteady man in prayer: he can appeal to God as <hi>David</hi> doth, Pſal. 40.9. <hi>I have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained my Lips, Oh Lord, thou knoweſt.</hi> Chriſts ſpirit dwells in him: he doth not ſojourn in him for a time, but he dwells in him as in his fixed and his ſetled habitation, and he dwells in him as a ſpirit of ſupplication; So the ſpirit of Chriſt is called, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. And hence it is that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes putting him upon the duty, upon all occaſions, ſo that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in it. Chriſts ſpirit is at home ſtill, though ours be wandring many times, even to the other end of all the earth. And though Chriſts ſpirit ſeem to be given ſometimes as a ſpirit of conſolation, yet then he will be preſent as a ſpirit of ſupplication: He will ſet a Saint to prayer, even when he ſeems moſt indiſpoſed and averſe: he will not ſuffer him to lay it by, and wholly to neglect the duty, as is obſervable in <hi>David, I
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:46169:274"/>
ſaid that I am cut off from before thine eyes,</hi> ſaith he, Pſal. 31.22. <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs thou heardeſt the voice of my prayer.</hi> Even then I prayed to thee when I was in that temper; ſo in another place, <hi>from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, even when my heart is overwhelmed,</hi> Pſal. 61.2. And whence proceedeth this my brethren? ſurely theſe prayers of all others flow from Chriſts ſpirit as the Apoſtle teacheth, Rom. 8.20. <hi>The ſpirit helpeth our infirmities:</hi> We know not what to pray for as we ought, but then the ſpirit it ſelf makes interceſſion for us with ſighs and groans that cannot be expreſt.</p>
               <p>If we act by Chriſts ſpirit, we come to God as to a Father, we cry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Abba Father to him, as you have it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. Becauſe ye are Sons, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his Son into your hearts.</hi> And what doth that ſpirit there? you have it in the next verſe, <hi>crying Abba Father.</hi> So that Chriſts ſpirit, if he act in us, makes us addreſs our ſelves to God as to a Father. And that my brethren, carries two things in it. This ſpirit makes us come to God with the expectations of Children, and with the affections of Children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If Chriſts ſpirit act in us, he makes us come to God in prayer with Child-like expectations. Expecting from him all the mercy, pitty, and compaſſion which a Child can look for from his own Father. He makes us to approach the throne of grace with great aſſurance of audience and acceptance and ſucceſs there; commonly he doth this.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But yet I muſt confeſs An hypocrite may ſometimes have theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, and a child of God may want them. The Jews had Child-like expectations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.4. they cryed to God Thou art my Father, and wilt not thou that art my Father pitty me and help me? ſure thou wilt; and yet they had no Child-like affections, no care at all to pleaſe God, and therefore it is added in the next words, that they ſaid and did as evill as they could. But now my brethren he that acts by Chriſts ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as he hath Child-like expectations, ſo he hath Child-like affections, or if at any time he want his Child-like expectations, yet ſtill he hath his Child-like affections. Though he be in ſuch a caſe that he is verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded for the preſent, that God will neither own him, nor regard him, nor look upon him as a Son, yet he loves God ſtill. He hath a Childs heart to God, even when he thinks that God hath not a Fathers heart to him. Though he ſeem to frown upon him, and to hide his face and to turn away his prayers, yet he hath dear affections to the Lord notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this. And this appears by the trouble he is in at God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: it grieves him ſo that he is ſick of love, as the poor Church was, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. when Chriſt withdrew himſelf a while, this was her grief, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoul loveth. I will go into the City and ſeek him whom my ſoul loveth. I ſaid unto the watchmen, Did ye ſee him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> And ſo when God withdraws himſelf from ſuch a one as is endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his ſpirit, the very ſoul of ſuch a perſon loves him ſtill: when he is very much afraid that he ſhall never find God more, that God will never ſhew him favour more, when he hath loſt his Child-like expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet ſtill he maintains his Child-like affections.</p>

               <p>AND thus far of the manner of our Saviours prayer. Proceed we to the matter of it: And here we have the perſons that he prayes for, <hi>thoſe whom thou haſt given me:</hi> And then the thing that he deſires in the behalf of thoſe perſons, <hi>that they alſo may be with me where I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the perſons whom our Saviour prayes for, you ſee they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed here by the Fathers giving them to Jeſus Chriſt. Let them be what they will in all conſiderations and reſpects beſides, it matters not in this, of what Nation, Condition, Station, Diſpoſition or Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the preſent, if God have given them to him, his will is that they be with him where he is.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt diſtinguiſh as we have done before of the Fathers giving to the Son. The Father gives men to the Son either for outward Miniſtration, or inward union and incorporation; Either to be his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, or to be his members. In the firſt ſence <hi>Judas</hi> was himſelf given to the Lord Chriſt, to be his Miniſter and his Apoſtle, as Chriſt himſelf acknowledges, ver. 12. <hi>Thoſe whom thou gaveſt me I kept, and none of of them is loſt but the Son of perdition.</hi> Now they who in this ſence are given to the Lord Chriſt to be his Miniſters and Servants only, not his members, are not the men for whom he prayes in this place, that they alſo may be with him where he is: becauſe he knows they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for another place. <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo beſtowed upon him, and yet he was a loſt Creature. The Father gave him to the Son, and he loſt him (as you may ſee in the forecited Text) never to enjoy him more.</p>
               <p>But now there are another ſort whom God the Father gives to Chriſt for inward union, whom he beſtows upon him for to be members of his body. And they muſt needs be with him, who are in him: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of queſtion theſe are they for whom he prayes, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where was Chriſt when he ſpake theſe words? Why he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth: he was here in the world: what then doth he deſire that true believers might be with him here? Is that the aim of his petition? No, it is a higher thing for which he is Suitor here, their being with him in a higher and more glorious place. Only you muſt conceive him here to ſpeak (as his uſual manner is) as if he were in heaven already. As <hi>ver.</hi> 11. of this Chapter, <hi>And now I am no more in the world.</hi> So in my Text, <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am:</hi> That is, in heaven where I am to be, and whither I am now going: So that it is as if I were already there, it being ſuch a certain near approaching inſtant thing: and in that place I would have all thoſe to be, whom thou haſt given me by election, and whom in thine eternal Counſell and Decree thou haſt appointed to be members of my body. <hi>Father, I will, &amp;c.</hi> So that the Point to be obſerved is this.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> It is the will of Jeſus Chriſt that all that are his own by the donation of the Father, ſhall be in heaven where he is.</head>
                  <p>There are two things in the Doctrine, which I might prove clear in order, before I come to Application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that there are ſome certain men, whom God the Father hath made over to the Son, that belong to Jeſus Chriſt, and are his own by donation from the Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that it is the will of Chriſt, that they who are ſo his own, ſhall be in heaven where he is.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome certain men who belong to Jeſus Chriſt, who are his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> own by donation from the Father. And he gives them to the Son, by his Decree from everlaſting, and by the execution of the ſame Decree in time. This I do but mention here, becauſe it hath been largely handled on <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſecond branch, that it is the will of Chriſt, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> who are ſo his own, ſhall be in heaven, where himſelf is; you ſee it is the Suit he makes to God the Father in my Text, <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am,</hi> that is, in heaven where I am to be. In heaven where I am already in my Godhead, and where I am to be very ſhortly in my Manhood; there I will have them to be alſo.</p>
                  <p>And for this end our Saviour Chriſt is gone to heaven, even to make heaven ready for his people, that ſo they may be preſently admitted when they come. He yields it as one ſpecial cauſe of his departure from his Apoſtles and Diſciples, when he was about to leave them; ſaith he, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you,</hi> Joh. 4.2. When he entred into heaven and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in, to the immediate preſence of his Father, he took poſſeſsion of it in our name and ſtead, and left it open after him to all his members. He hath in this reſpect prepared it for them, that he hath made it ready to receive them; And when they are ready too, he will come and receive them to himſelf, that where he is, there may they be alſo, as it is added, <hi>Joh</hi> 14.3. And upon this account it was that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to be diſſolved, becauſe he was aſſured that aſſoon as that was over, he ſhould be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. and ſo he teaches us expreſly in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>that all that ſleep in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall be for ever with the Lord,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17. By which it is apparent, that it is the will of Chriſt, that all that are his own by the donation of the Father, ſhall be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven where himſelf is. But you will ask me, Why will he have them to be there?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that a man would think it neceſſary by reaſon of the union between Chriſt and them, that ſeeing they are one, they ſhould be in one place. But you muſt know (my brethren) that the corporeal and local preſence of the parties contributes nothing to the union that is made between Chriſt and his members, which is a ſpiritual and inviſible
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:46169:276"/>
thing, and which no neerneſs in regard of place can further, no diſtance in regard of place can hinder. So that Chriſts people may be in him, though they be not with him (in the ſence wherein I ſpeak.) I mean not with him in the ſame place. Their being with him locally in heaven, is no way neceſſary to their union with him: Or were it ſo, the Saints on earth were in a very ill caſe. Well then, this cannot be the reaſon why Chriſt would have his people to be in one place with him: <hi>that they may be one with him.</hi> They may be this without the other. But there are divers other weighty reaſons of the Point: I ſhall name a few of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> Chriſt would have his people be in heaven where himſelf is, becauſe he hath a dear affection to them, his heart is carried out exceedingly in love to them. And more particularly and diſtinctly, he loves them with a love of benevolence, and he loves them with a love of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt would have his people be in heaven, where himſelf is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves them with a love of benevolence: With ſuch a love as makes him with them all the good that they are poſſibly capable of. Now my beloved, what greater good can be wiſhed to true Believers, then to be with Chriſt in heaven? To be in heaven where they ſhall be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and compleatly holy and happy, where they ſhall never ſin, and where they ſhall never ſuffer any more: where holineſs and happineſs ſhall be both perfect: where there is fulneſs of joy and pleaſure for evermore: and to be with Chriſt there, of whoſe immediate prefence true believers are inavoidably debarred as long as they remain in this world: <hi>While they are at home in the body, they are abſent from the Lord,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. But when they come to heaven they ſhall be with him, they ſhall have the compleat and full fruition and enjoyment of him, which is the greateſt happineſs that can be. <hi>To be with Chriſt is beſt of all,</hi> 1 Phil. 23. To be with Saints on Earth is good, though they be imperfect here, and though by reaſon of their imperfections they be the leſs delightfull, and the leſs beneficial to us: To be with Saints in heaven is better, becauſe they are perfect there: <hi>There are the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect:</hi> But to be with Chriſt there, is beſt of all. This is ſo good that there is nothing better; there is no higher happineſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by any creature. And therefore Chriſt would have his people to enjoy it, to be in heaven where himſelf is, becauſe he loves them with a love of benevolence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt would have his people to be in heaven where himſelf is, becauſe he loves them with a love of complacency, becauſe he takes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them: and friends that delight in one another, think it not ſufficient to be preſent each with other by the preſence of their hearts and ſpirits. No, if it be poſſible, they will be preſent each with other in their bodies too: as you may ſee in <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> what ſhifts they made to come together. So Jeſus Chriſt who loves his people out of meaſure, is not content that he is with them in his ſpirit, and that they are again with him in their ſpirits. No, this is not enough, but he muſt have their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with him too, he muſt enjoy their company in heaven, or elſe it is
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:46169:276"/>
not well there. Chriſt is not fully ſatisfied till he enjoy the ſweet Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his beloved Saints in heaven, with whom he hath ſuch intimate and dear acquaintance, while they are here upon earth. And hence he beggs his Father for them to bring them to the ſame place where himſelf is, as if he could not live in heaven without them, <hi>Father, I will that, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is a ſecond reaſon added in the Text, which I ſhall handle <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> only under that conſideration, <hi>Father, I will that they whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am.</hi> And why ſo? might the Father ask him, Why <hi>that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me,</hi> as it is added in the next words. That they may ſee the luſtre which I ſparkle with. The glory of Chriſts humane nature in heaven, is exceeding great. The Evangeliſt who ſaw it through the dimm ſpectacles of humane frailty, endeavours as he can to ſet it forth: Saith he, <hi>his Countenance was as the Sun that ſhineth in his ſtrength.</hi> Apoc. 1.16. But this was but a ſhort reſemblance: Our Saviour Chriſt who knew it better, carries it a little higher: <hi>The Son of man</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall come in the glory of the Father,</hi> Mat. 16.27. In compariſon of whoſe incomparable luſtre and tranſcendent brightneſs the Sun it ſelf is but a ſhaddow: Now Chriſt would have his people be in heaven where himſelf is, that they may ſee this glory which he ſh nes withall. But why would he have them ſee it? what ſhall they gain by it?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. While they ſee it, they cannot but exceedingly rejoyce in it. It cannot but tranſport them even to an extaſie of joy, to ſee him whom they love ſo infinitely, ſparkle forth with ſuch dazling raies of glory. Oh will the poor believer ſay, This is my head, my husband whom my ſoul loveth, that is become ſo out of meaſure glorious. There was a time when he was black, and when there was no form nor beauty in him, when wretched men made him vile and ignominious, and when they hid their faces, as if they were aſhamed of him: But now he ſhines forth as the Sun that hath been masked with a gloomy cloud. This is he that died for me, that ſhed his blood for me, that loved me and gave himſelf for me. Oh how my heart is raviſhed to behold his glory.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. While they behold it, as they ſhall rejoyce in it, ſo they ſhall partake of it. And that eſpecially two wayes both by union and reflection.</p>
                  <p>Firſt they ſhall partake of it by union, for being one with Jeſus Chriſt, they cannot chooſe but ſhare together with him in his glory. And as the glory of the members, redoundeth to the glory of the head, in which reſpect it is that the Apoſtle ſaith that, <hi>Chriſt ſhall be admired in all them that believe:</hi> So on the other ſide the glory of the head, redoundeth much more to the glory of the members.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And as they ſhall partake hereof by union, ſo alſo by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when they ſee Chriſt: while they behold the glory of the Lord they ſhall be transformed into the ſame image from glory to glory. <hi>Their vile bodies ſhall be conformed to his glorious body,</hi> Phil. 3.21. <hi>And while they ſee him as he is, they ſhall be like him,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates, 1 Epiſt. 3.2. <hi>They ſhall bear the very image of the heavenly Adam,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.48. And as the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhined when he had been with
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:46169:277"/>
God upon the Mount, ſo when we come to be with Chriſt in heaven, and to behold his glory there, we ſhall reflect it back again, and ſo ſhall ſhine together with him in the ſame glory.</p>
                  <p>And this is another reaſon why Chriſt will have his people to be with him, that they may ſee his glory, and ſeeing, may partake of it, both by union and reflection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> Now to deſcend to application: Is it the will of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here then you ſee the ſingular and extraordinary happineſs of Chriſts people. If they were alwayes to remain, to ſet up their perpetual abode in this world, it would be very ſad with them: It is a vale of tears, a moſt uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place, eſpecially to Chriſts people in which they are not like to have a quiet hour almoſt as long as they remain in it.</p>
                  <p>But now the comfort is, that it is the will of Chriſt that they that are beſtowed upon him by his Father, ſhall not alwayes ſtay here, that he will have them come to heaven where himſelf is: That he will not alwayes leave them in this vale of tears, but he will one day bring them to a place of joy, there to enjoy himſelf for ever: to keep no longer at a diſtance from him, but to be with him where he is. To be with Chriſt in any place muſt needs be ſweet. It was a high expreſſion of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, that he had rather be in hell with Chriſt, (if it were poſſible) then anywhere beſides without him. But to be in heaven with Chriſt, this is excellent indeed: To be in ſuch a glorious place as heaven is, the bleſſedneſs of which no tongue of men or Angels is ſufficient to expreſs, and to be with Chriſt there: To behold his glory there, and to partake with him of the ſame glory: This is ſuch happineſs <hi>as neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But who ſhall partake of it? who ſhall be raiſed to this high felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? why they that are Chriſts own people, as you have it in the point. It is the will of Chriſt that all that are his own, ſhall be in heaven where himſelf is: So that if you be Chriſts people, if God have given you to Chriſt, and put you into him as members of his body, you are the men that ſhall be with him where he is. When other men are caſt out, when they are puniſhed with eternal perdition from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord and from the glory of his power, you ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into neareſt fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt; when he ſaith to other men, Avaunt, be gone, in the ſad day of ſeparation, <hi>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> there to enjoy no better company then the Devil and his Angels, he will ſay to you Draw neer, come, you are company for me, you muſt dwell with me for ever. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, ſit down with me in my Kingdom.</hi> Ah, my beloved, this is a ſweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable thing indeed.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the matter of our Saviours prayer, or the thing which he deſires in the behalf of true believers, that they may be with him where he is. Together with the reaſon of it why he would have them to be with him, that they may behold his glory: which we have handled alſo with relation to the point.</p>
                  <p>In the remainder of the verſe you have a reaſon of a reaſon. Our Saviour having ſpoken of the glory beſtowed upon him by his Father,
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:46169:277"/>
which he would have believers to behold: it might be queſtioned how he came by this glory, or what induced the Father to beſtow it on the Son. Why ſaith our Saviour, he gave it me becauſe he loved me from Eternity. <hi>Father, I will that they,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they may behold the glory which thou haſt given me; For thou haſt loved me;</hi> mark it, <hi>thou haſt loved me,</hi> and therefore thou haſt given me this glory; <hi>That they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me, for thou lovedſt me before the foundation of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no difficulty in the words, unleſs it be in that expreſſion, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundation of the world;</hi> a phraſe of ſpeech very uſual in the Scripture, and applyed to many things, as I might give you inſtances enough: But it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that it denotes Eternity whereſoever it is uſed. And that <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>from the foundation of the world,</hi> (for we meet with both expreſſions) is as much in Scripture lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as to ſay <hi>from everlaſting:</hi> For whatſoever was before the world was made, my brethren, was eternal; ſo that when our Saviour ſaith to God the Father, <hi>Thou haſt loved me before the foundation of the world,</hi> It is as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, Thou haſt loved me from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, from Everlaſting: And ſo accordingly the point ſhall be,</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That God the Father hath dearly loved Jeſus Chriſt from all Eternity.</head>
                  <p>There are two things in the point which I ſhall orderly purſue. Firſt God the Father hath dearly loved Jeſus Chriſt. Secondly, he hath done ſo from all Eternity, <hi>Before the foundation of the world was laid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the firſt of theſe, That God the Father loveth Jeſus Chriſt, you ſee it is the clear expreſs aſſertion of our Saviour in my Text. And therefore if you mark him, you ſhall find that he is often ſpeaking of his Fathers love to him, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.9. and in the 23. verſe of this Chapter. And on the other ſide, the Father he profeſſes his tranſcendent love to Chriſt, and that out of heaven it ſelf, Mat. 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son.</hi> I have ſome other children that I love well, but <hi>this is my beloved Son</hi> above the reſt, take notice of him, this is he, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtand to prove ſo clear a truth, That God the Father dearly loveth Jeſus Chriſt. But you will ask me, Why doth God the Father love him?</p>
                  <p>Truly, my Brethren, there is cauſe enough why he ſhould love him,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>
                     </label> and love him out of all meaſure. There are two things, my Brethren, that qualifie an object, and that make it meet for love; Proportion, and Propriety; and both of theſe muſt meet together. Now both of theſe concurre in Chriſt, ſo that he is compleatly fitted for his Fathers love. For,</p>
                  <p>There is Proportion, He is very like the Father, and that both as God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and Man.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="510" facs="tcp:46169:278"/>1. As God, he is extreamly like the Father, he is the very picture of him as we uſe to ſay; <hi>The expreſs Image of his Fathers Perſon;</hi> not of the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. Indeed he repreſenteth and reſembleth him in every thing. The Father is Almighty, ſo is he; the Father is Eternal, ſo is he; the Father is Immutable and Omnipreſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo is he; <hi>He is his expreſs Image.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay ſhall I go a little further? The Father as a Perſon diſtinguiſhed from the Son, hath nothing proper and peculiar to himſelf, but is in ſome reſpect expreſſed and declared in the Son. His act of generation or begetting, is ſhewed forth in the begotten: ſo that unleſs he were the Father, it is impoſſible he ſhould be nearer to the Father, or better like the Father then he is. And if he were the Father, he could not be the Fathers Image, he could not be like the Father; for <hi>Nullum ſimile eſt idem.</hi> Thus Chriſt as God you ſee my Brethren, is the moſt abſolute and perfect Character of God the Father, like him in every thing in all reſpects, as one face anſwereth another in a glaſs: Having no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward difference between them ſave only this, that by their relative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, they are diſtinguiſhed the one from the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As man our Saviour is extreamly like the Father too; <hi>He is the Image of the inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. As he hath aſſumed our fleſh, he is the very Image of the Father. And therefore the Apoſtle ſaith not ſimply, who is the Image of God, but <hi>of the inviſible God:</hi> In which there is a cloſe Antitheſis, <hi>q. d.</hi> Having aſſumed our Nature, he is now become the viſible Image of the inviſible God; That God who is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is made viſible in him. And this is that which is ſuggeſted in that ſpeech of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, Joh. 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time;</hi> conceive it with the outward eye; <hi>The Son of man who is in the boſom of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> He hath diſcovered him in ſome reſpect to that eye, becauſe he is ſo very like him. So that if you ſee the Son, you ſhall ſee the Father in him; the reſemblance is ſo great, that in ſeeing one of them, you ſee the other. And hence ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Philip</hi> once, Joh. 14.9. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father alſo.</hi> So that our Saviour both as God and Man, is like the Father, and ſo in that reſpect is fitted for his Fathers love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And as there is Proportion, ſo Propriety; as he is like the Father, ſo he is the Fathers own, and therefore meet to be beloved of him. Indeed there is an intereſt on both hands. God is Chriſts God; <hi>God even thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal 45.7. And Chriſt is Gods Chriſt, Pſal. 2.2. <hi>The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſel together againſt the Lord, and againſt his</hi> Chriſt. Indeed he is the Fathers Choſen, the Fathers ſervant, the Fathers Son; He is his Son as God by eternal generation, as man by union: He is his in all capacities, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all conſiderations; take him which way you will, he is the Fathers: So that no marvail though the Father love him, and love him dearly too. We that are men are wont to love our own, yea many times we dote upon them, though they have little lovely in them. But Chriſt who is his Fathers own, is altogether lovely, ſo that he hath cauſe to love him. And this for clearing of the firſt branch, that God the Father loveth Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="511" facs="tcp:46169:278"/>Now for the ſecond branch, that he hath loved him from everlaſting, This is expreſly taught us alſo in the Text; <hi>Thou haſt loved me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> that is, before time was. As the time will never be when God will not love Chriſt; So the time never was when God did not love Chriſt: That place is notable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Prov. 8.22. <hi>The Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was ſet up from everlaſting,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I was as one brought up with him, and I was dayly his delight.</hi> Obſerve it well, <hi>I was dayly his delight.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I, you will anſwer, he was ſo as God; But how was he ſo as man?</hi>

Though things are paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come with us, yet they are not ſo with God. All things are preſent with him, at the ſame time; as Jeſus Chriſt, in reference to God and his decree, <hi>was ſlain,</hi> ſo he was incarnate too, <hi>before the foundation of the world;</hi> and ſo he was beloved as man, and as incarnate <hi>before the foundation of the world:</hi> and under this conſideration he ſpeaks, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to his Father in my Text; <hi>Thou haſt loved me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>viz.</hi> as Man and Mediator <hi>before the foundation of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, That God the Father dearly loveth Jeſus Chriſt?<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe. </seg>
                     </label> then ſurely it is ill with them that hate him, and it is well with them that love him. If God love Jeſus Chriſt ſo dearly, certainly he hates them that hate Chriſt, and he loves them that love Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If God love Jeſus Chriſt ſo dearly, he hates them that hate Chriſt: and he will ſurely be avenged on them to the very utmoſt. The love he bears to Jeſus Chriſt, will ſtir him up to execute his fierceſt wrath, and to take moſt ſevere revenge upon them. Believe it, brethren, God will not ſpare them in the day of vengeance, he will ſhew no bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to them who hate his dear Son Chriſt, to whom he bears ſuch infinite affection. The more he loves Chriſt, the more he will hate them that hate him, and the more ſharply will he deal with them.</p>
                  <p>But you ask me, <hi>Are there any ſuch that hate Chriſt? and if there be,</hi>

He is not hated only of a company of men that are but forraigners and ſtrangers to him, as the Heathen are, (for that is no ſuch admirable thing, that they that know him not ſhould hate him) but of his Citizens who are acquainted with him, and who are under his immediate Rule and Juriſdiction, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14. He is refuſed, not of the Heathen people only, but of divers in the Church, and ſome of them of greateſt note, authority and learning there, to wit, the builders of the Church.

Where our Saviour hath a

Chriſt can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want his enemies where Satan hath ſuch intereſt, and ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as this is. Indeed the greateſt Enemie that Chriſt hath in the world (conceit it among mortal men) is in the Church, and that is An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, a Biſhop too, who hath his name from being oppoſite to Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as who ſhould ſay againſt Chriſt. He ſitteth in the Temple, <hi>in the Church,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.4. There were falſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Church of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> who notwithſtanding all their glorious proteſtations, were <hi>enemies to Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle tells them plainly, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. and he tells it them with tears, he was ſo much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it. And ſurely there are many everywhere, and in every Congregation, who pretend much worſhip and ſubmiſſion, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and reſpect to Chriſt: And yet ſuch is the damnable hypocriſie and falſeneſs of the hearts of men, they ſwell with inward ranck or, rage, and hate againſt him. It is not every one that calls him <hi>Rabbi</hi> Maſter, as the falſe <hi>Herodians</hi> did, that kiſſes him, and bows before him, and ſalutes him with Hayl Maſter, as deceitful <hi>Judas</hi> did, that is indeed a friend to Chriſt: No, men may make a flouriſh, and profeſs they love the Lord, and ſay that he is infinitely dear unto them, and yet may be as real enemies to him, and to his Kingdom, as <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed him, the Judge and Officers and people that condemned, and ſcourged, and crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
                  <p>And now my brethren, Will you ſay to me as the Diſciples to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he told them, that one of them ſhould betray him? Will you ask me man by man, <hi>Is it I?</hi> and <hi>is it I?</hi> No, I expect to hear you ſay, It is not I. What, I an enemy to Chriſt? I defie it; and they that are his greateſt enemies will be as bold and reſolute in the denyal as any other. And therefore as our Saviour gave a ſign to the Diſciples, by which the Traytor might be known; ſo I will give you certain ſigns out of Scripture, by which the enemies of Chriſt may be diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Firſt they that are willing to ſubmit to ſin, and are unwilling to ſubmit to Chriſt, <hi>they are enemies to Chriſt.</hi> I will a little ſtand on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch of this mark. They that are willing to ſubmit to ſin, <hi>they are enemies to Chriſt:</hi> 'Tis true indeed men may be taken captive by it, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was, they may be forc't to obey it in ſome certain acts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their ſtriving, by the power of a temptation which they are no way able to reſiſt, and yet may be the friends of Chriſt; they may unfaignedly and dearly love the Lord Jeſus. But if they render up themſelves to any luſt, if they make a Covenant with it, as being willing and reſolved to obey it; if not content that they are ſold by <hi>Adam,</hi> they ſell themſelves to ſin, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, <hi>they are enemies to Chriſt: No man can ſerve two Maſters,</hi> that are contrary, <hi>as God and Mammon,</hi> Chriſt and ſin; for ſaith our Saviour, <hi>He will love the one, and hate the other,</hi> Mat. 6.24. So then if you be ſervants voluntarily engaged to
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:46169:279"/>
any ſin, as being willing to obey it in the luſts thereof. Whether it be drunkenneſs, or ſwearing, or uncleanneſs, or the like; If you reſolve it is a ſweet, it is a profitable ſin, I will not ſtrive nor pray againſt it, becauſe I mean not to forſake it, you do indeed hate Chriſt. It may be you do think that you may ſerve a luſt, and love the Lord Chriſt too: But you deceive your own ſouls; for the Truth of God hath ſaid it, that he that loves the one, will hate the other: As they that ſerve Chriſt, hate ſin; ſo they that ſerve ſin, hate Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And for the ſecond branch of this mark, as they that willingly obey ſin, ſo they that are unwilling to obey Chriſt, they are enemies to Chriſt. <hi>You are my friends,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>if you do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you,</hi> Joh. 15.14. otherwiſe you are not. And hence he ſtyleth thoſe <hi>his enemies, who will not have him rule over them,</hi> Luk. 19.27. Obſerve it well, he ſaith not ſimply, Thoſe that will not have me raign; but <hi>thoſe mine enemies that will not have me raign over them, bring them forth and ſlay them before me.</hi> If then you will not ſtoop to Chriſt, and to the Scepter of his Kingdom; if you will not have him rule you, if you will not do the things that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you, but are reſolved to walk according to your own humors, and though you are informed what is good, and what the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of you, yet you hate to be reformed, and pluck away the ſhoulder, as the Prophet ſpeaks, and ſay with thoſe rebellious wretches, Pſal. 2.3. <hi>Let us break his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us,</hi> that we may walk at liberty, and that there may be no reſtraint from any thing that ſeemeth good in our own eyes: be not deceived, for you are Adverſaries of the Lord Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are enemies to Chriſt, that love that which Chriſt hates, and hate that which Chriſt loves. It is the property of near and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome friends, to will and nill, to love and hate the ſame things; and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are juſt upon the other hand: and ſo it is in this caſe. They that are in love with ſin, (which is the thing, the only thing which Chriſt hates) are ſurely out of love with Chriſt. <hi>They that love the Lord, hate evil,</hi> Pſal. 97.10. and I may ſay as well, They that love evil, hate the Lord. It's true, that ſuch as love him, may commit it, but yet they have a ſtrange antipathy againſt it, they hate it with a perfect hatred, and every falſe way they utterly abhor. And hence it is that they endeavour to deſtroy it, to crucifie it every day, to put it to the cruelleſt and baſeſt death, and if they had it in their power, they would ſhew it no mercy. You would not uſe a Turk, a Toad, as ſuch a man would uſe ſin. But when a man ſhall cocker it, and ſtroke it, and delight in it, when he ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to have it ſtriken with the hammer, or wounded with the Sword of Gods Word, but ſhall be ready to do violence to any man that offers it a blow, or gives it but an ill word, the heart of ſuch a perſon is not right towards Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And even as they are enemies to Chriſt, who love that which Chriſt hates, ſo alſo they who hate that which Chriſt loves, and that is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and grace, which he cannot chooſe but love, becauſe it is a beam of his own light, a gift of his own ſpirit, a ſtamp of his own Image, a
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:46169:280"/>
part of his own fulneſs, <hi>for of his fulneſs have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi> But you will ſay, Who hates this? I anſwer they that perſecute and ſcorn and vex their brethren for their ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they follow that which good is, becauſe they fear an oath, becauſe they run not out with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, they are the men that hate grace. For it is holineſs and grace you ſee that is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per object, and indeed the formal reaſon of their hatred. And they that hate their brethren for their holineſs and grace, which they have received from Chriſt, by which they are conformable and like to Chriſt, would hate him ſo much more then them, if he ſhould come and live among them, by how much he is holier then they are. And therefore let not ſuch as ſay they could affect and like of ſuch a perſon well enough, but that he is ſo pure and ſo preciſe, he will not do as they do, pretend any love to Chriſt. For certainly the ſame affections of ſpite and malice and reproach which they diſcover againſt ſuch men, they would with ſo much greater bitterneſs expreſs againſt the Lord Chriſt, if he were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant upon the earth, by how much he exceedeth and tranſcendeth them in holineſs and grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that are friends to the enemies of Chriſt, and enemies to the friends of Chriſt, are enemies to Chriſt himſelf. Be they who they will that cloſe with thoſe that live in enmity againſt Chriſt, and help them in their oppoſition to his truth and to his cauſe, and to his glory, they can never love Chriſt. No, if they did, they could never ſide with thoſe that are profeſſed adverſaries to the Lord Jeſus, and who endeavour to ſubvert and overthrow his worſhip and religion, and deſtroy his people. And certainly Chriſt cannot chooſe but take them for his enemies, and uſe them like his enemies, while they incorporate themſelves with thoſe that live in open oppoſition and hoſtility againſt him.</p>
                  <p>And as the friends unto the enemies of Chriſt, even ſo the enemies unto the friends of Chriſt, are enemies to Chriſt himſelf. They that are adverſaries to the Saints, who are as it is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the friends of God, the friends of Chriſt, muſt needs be adverſaries to the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. There is a Covenant and a League of love between the Lord and them, and the league is not defenſive only, but offenſive too; he that toucheth them, ſaith Chriſt, toucheth the Apple of mine eye; touch them, &amp; touch me, <hi>Zac.</hi> 2.8. Nay, they are not alone in Covenant with him, but more then ſo my brethren, they are one with him. And therefore they are called Chriſt, 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members are but one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt:</hi> conceive it Chriſt <hi>in aggregate,</hi> comprizing all the Church with him; for, <hi>caput &amp; corpus unus eſt Chriſtus</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) the head and the body is but one Chriſt: and that which is the name of Chriſt, Jer. 23.6. <hi>This is his name by which he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs,</hi> is the Churchss name too, Jer. 33.16. <hi>This is the name wherewith ſhe ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Indeed his people are the members of his body, and he can never be a friend unto the head, who is an adverſary to the members.</p>
                  <p>Now if on triall by the former evidences, you find that you hate Chriſt, believe it God hates you. The dearer his affection to his Son Chriſt is,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:46169:280"/>
the greater is his hatred of the enemies of Chriſt. The union is ſo neer, and the love ſo infinite between the Father and the Son, that God may truly ſay to Jeſus Chriſt, Do not I hate them that hate thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred, as though they were mine enemies: And I will ſurely take a courſe with them, I will bring them low enough. <hi>Sit thou at my right hand,</hi> there ſit thou ſtill unmoved and undiſturbed, <hi>till I have made thine enemies thy footſtool.</hi>

               <p>IS it ſo that God the Father dearly loveth Jeſus Chriſt? hence then it <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> follows, that as he hates them that hate Chriſt, ſo on the other ſide he loveth them that love Chriſt. The dear affection that he bears to Chriſt draws out his very heart to all thoſe that love Chriſt. And this is that which Jeſus Chriſt himſelf teacheth, <hi>John</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that loveth me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall be loved of my Father.</hi> Let him be what he will, of what condition or eſtate he will, never ſo poor and mean and deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the world, if he do really and truly love me, my Father loves that man, and loves him dearly for my ſake. Nay ſaith the Father, this man is my Sons friend, he bears a very great affection to my Son Chriſt, and therefore I muſt needs eſteem and love him for my Sons ſake. I have alwayes loved my Son, even from all eternity, and that out of all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and upon this account my love and my affection overflows to all thoſe that love him.</p>
               <p>Oh how ſhould this prevail with every one of us to love Chriſt, and love him dearly, ſince God the Father will requite us to the utmoſt for all the love we ſhew to him; all the love that we lay out on Jeſus Chriſt, he will pay us back again, and pay us in the ſame coin. We may depend upon it, that we ſhall have love for love. If we love Chriſt, the Father he will love us. And is the Fathers love worth nothing? Ah, my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, it bringeth with it all the happineſs and mercy that a poor ſoul is capable of: And therefore I beſeech you let us love Chriſt: let Chriſt have our love, that we may have the Fathers love. And here to warm your hearts a little, and to draw them out to Chriſt, take notice of theſe few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. View him in himſelf, behold him in the choiceneſs and excellency of his own beauty; There is no ſpot, nor imperfection in him, in the very leaſt degree; <hi>He is fairer then the children of men,</hi> Pſal. 45.2. then any of them all, let them be what they will: for they have blemiſhes, but he hath none. All the perfections in the world do meet in him, ſo that there can be nothing added to him. Indeed (my brethren) he is altogether lovely. All others have their imperfections and defects, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there is unlovely in them: but he is altogether lovely: And this is that which makes the Church ſo far in love with him: She is taken with his beauty, and the delicious ſavour of his ointments, the ſweetneſs
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:46169:281"/>
of the graces that are in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. How is ſhe raviſht in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of him? <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved?</hi> ſay the daughters to her there; What is he more? ſaith ſhe: me thinks ſhe is an end with that word: Why have you no eyes to ſee? He is tranſcendent, incomparable, and ſo deſcribeth him from top to toe, and then concludes, <hi>This is my beloved O ye daughters, look upon him, this is he:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, now judge you whether I have cauſe to love him, yea, or no. And therefore I am not aſhamed to own it: and if you meet with my beloved, you may tell him that I love him, yea that <hi>I am ſick of love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider in the next place what he is to you, what intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety you have in him. Why, my beloved, he is yours: I ſpeak this to believers only. And this the Church and Spouſe of Chriſt profeſſeth often, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> and yields this as the reaſon of the high and dear affection that ſhe bears him. A woman, you will ſay, hath cauſe to love her own husband. Now Jeſus Chriſt is the husband of the Church, ſhe is his wife, his ſpouſe, his ſecond ſelf, ſhe is called by his name: <hi>We are thine</hi> (ſay the people of the Lord) <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then are not ſo, nor are they called by thy name.</hi> So that the Saints in this reſpect, are infinitely more obliged to love him, then theſe that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the pale, becauſe they have not ſuch relation to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the exceeding love of Chriſt to you, draw out your love to him again. <hi>Amor</hi> (they ſay) is <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s amoris.</hi> And ſo let his love be a whet to you. Conſider he hath loved you, and therefore you have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to love him again. This reaſon doth not hold on both ſides: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that we have loved Chriſt, and therefore he hath cauſe to love us. For we never loved him till he loved us firſt, the love began on his ſide. But we may truly ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt hath loved us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have cauſe to love him. For he prevented us with mercy, and with loving kindneſs, as the Prophet ſpeaks; and this ſhould win our hearts to him. <hi>We love him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle in the name of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.19. Why ſo? what is the cauſe of this love? you have it in the following words, <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt.</hi> Our love is not the cauſe of his, but his love is the cauſe of ours.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Survey what Chriſt hath done for you, and ſee if it deſerve not at the leaſt a return of love from you. He hath made you (that is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: in compariſon I mean) all things were created by him, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. but more then this, <hi>he hath redeemed you from ſin, from death, from hell it ſelf.</hi> You had been utterly undone, and loſt for ever, had it not been for Jeſus Chriſt. But he hath ſaved that which was loſt. He hath raiſed you from nothing to a Kingdom, from poverty to matchleſs riches, yea from death to life it ſelf: we were dead, but are alive; all this is Chriſts doing. We uſe to love them who have ſaved our lives: and ſurely we have cauſe to love Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he hath ſaved our lives, and that not from a temporal but from eternal death: Not from the firſt alone, but from the ſecond death, where the worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched: And therefore he is called <hi>our life,</hi> that is, the cauſe and fountain of it, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. <hi>When Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear.</hi>
                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:46169:281"/>
So that we may truly call him in the Prophets words, <hi>the God of our life;</hi> And therefore we have cauſe to make him the object of our love, and wholly to beſtow our hearts upon him; to love him, by whom we live the life of grace, and look to live the life of glory.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that God the Father dearly loveth Jeſus Chriſt? The more <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> it is to be admired and wondred at that he ſhould uſe him as he did for our ſakes: That he ſhould be angry with him, that he ſhould hide his face from him, and forſake him in a ſence: that he ſhould load him with ſuch a burthen of his wrath, as made him weep and cry, and ſweat and faint. Ah, my beloved, what an admirable thing is this? who can reach the utmoſt of it in his thoughts? had he not cared for Jeſus Chriſt, had he born no affection to him, it had not been ſo ſtrange, that God the Father ſhould deal with him in this manner; But that he ſhould be ſo extreamly harſh to him in whom his very ſoul delights: that he ſhould handle him ſo roughly whom he loves ſo dearly, whom he hath ever loved from all eternity, this is an admirable thing indeed. And that you may the better ſee the wonder of it, the miracle of mercy that is in it, let us conſider a little more particularly and diſtinctly, how the Father uſed him, and for whoſe ſake he uſed him ſo, who was ſo infinitely dear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider how the Father uſed him, who is ſo infinitely dear to him: <hi>he gave him up into the hands of ſinfull men, to deal with him as they pleaſed.</hi> There take the darling of my boſome (ſaith the Father) revile him, mock him, beat him, ſpit upon him, ſcourge him, pierce him, nail him, ſtretch his limbs upon the Croſs, crucifie him, kill him, ſhed his blood, take away his life from him; wreak all your malice on him to the utmoſt, and though he cry and roar, I will not ſave him, I will be far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and from the words of his roaring, as the expreſſion is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. Though God doth love him infinitely, he left him in the hands of vile men, to uſe him at their own pleaſure: and they uſed him bad enough, as you may ſee, if you ſurvey the Goſpel ſtory. Oh the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, reproaches, and contempts that ſinfull wretches poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord of glory! In which reſpect, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>he was deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and rejected, and men hid their faces from him,</hi> as if they were aſhamed of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.3. <hi>I am a reproach of men</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>David,</hi> as a type of Chriſt, Pſal. 22.6.) <hi>and deſpiſed of the people: all that ſee me laugh me to ſcorn.</hi> Oh the abaſures that he ſuffered from perſons viler then the earth they trod upon, and God the Father who ſo dearly loved him ſtood by, and made as if he ſaw nothing.</p>
               <p>Nay more then ſo, he ſuffered much even from his Fathers own hands, q He made him ſin, that is a ſacrifice for ſin, and he made him a curſe for us, that there was nothing viſible upon him for a ſeaſon but the ſevereſt and feirceſt wrath of a revenging Judge, as if he had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accurſed from his Father. He ſcourged him moſt bitterly, even till he blead and roared and ſunk away under his hand. <hi>Thus it pleaſed the Father to bruiſe him; He ſpared not his own Son,</hi> Rom. 8.22. Though he were his own Son, he laid on and did not ſpare him. He remitted not to Chriſt the leaſt jot of thoſe exquiſite &amp; unſufferable tortures, that were in juſtice
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:46169:282"/>
due to our tranſgreſſions. He drank off at his Fathers hands the cup of fury, he drank the very dreggs, and wrung them out. All this the Father did to Jeſus Chriſt, and more then I am able to expreſs, and yet he loved him infinitely all this while, and did from eternity, and therein lies the great wonder.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But ſecondly if we conſider for whoſe ſake the Father uſed him ſo who is infinitely dear to him, the wonder will be yet greater. It had not been ſo admirable, had it been for friends, but it was for enemies. This raiſes and commends the Love of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.10. <hi>that we being ſinners, yea being enemies, he reconciled us to him by his Son.</hi> He uſed a means, by giving up his Son to ſhame, to make up all the breaches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and him, and herein lies the quinteſſence of this buſineſs, the ſparkle in the jewel of the grace of God: That he ſhould prefer the good, the glory, the ſalvation of his enemies who lived in open oppoſition, and hoſtility againſt him, before the eaſe, refreſhment, ſafety, life of his own Son, whom he ſo dearly loved from all eternity: That he ſhould rather chooſe that one whom he loved ſo exceedingly, ſhould die, then they; ſhould be made a curſe, then they: ſhould undergo the tortures and the pains of hell, then they: juſtice reſolves they muſt be undergone either by his beloved Son, or his hatefull enemies. It muſt and will be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied either by the one or by the other. Well then if it muſt be ſo, his deareſt Son ſhall ſuffer, and his enemies go free; yea he ſhall ſuffer to the very death; rather then they ſhall be puniſhed (ſaith the Father,) There go my poor harmleſs Lamb to ſlaughter in their ſtead; there go his blood and life and all: He ſhall bleed and bleed to death, that they may be healed and live. Oh the narrow hearts of men! how far ſhort do they fall of comprehending ſuch a miracle of mercy! Well may the Angels wonder at it, and deſire to peep into it. Yea, the bleſſed Lord himſelf, whether as wondring at or willing to make us wonder at this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable buſineſs, hath called the nane of Chriſt Wonderfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Is it ſo that God the Father hath dearly loved Jeſus Chriſt from all eternity? This then may ſerve for ſweet and pretious conſolation to all them that belong to Chriſt: for they may be hence aſſured that God hath loved them from all eternity even as he did Chriſt. For if you mark it well, our Saviour ſpeaks here of the love the Father bare him as man and Mediator, as the head of his Church; and ſo he loved him not alone, but he loved his members in him, and he loved his members with him. Indeed he loved him as Mediator in reference to thoſe for whom he was to make peace: and loved him as a head in reference to thoſe who were to be members of his body: and as he had not been a Mediator and a head, but for the working of their ſalvation, whom God appointed thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo neither had he been beloved in that capacity, and under that conſideration, but upon the ſame account: and conſequently if he were beloved as man, and Mediator, and head of his Church from everlaſting, his people and his members were beloved from everlaſting too, without whom he was no head. They were deſigned to be members by the ſame decree by which he was deſigned to be head. And as they were elected in him, ſo they were beloved in him before the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="519" facs="tcp:46169:282"/>But you will ask me, Which way doth this yield you out ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious comfort that you have been beloved of God from all eternity?</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a comfort to conſider that the great and glorious God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth ſhould think of ſuch poor worms as we from everlaſting, much more that he ſhould ſet his love upon us. The world it may be looks upon us as not worth the ſpeaking of, as not worth the thinking of, much leſs as worthy of the leaſt reſpect: And this it may be troubles and dejects us now and then. But this may cheer us, and encourage us upon the other ſide, that God himſelf did think upon us, yea, and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love us too from all eternity: when we had not a being in the world, (ſave only in the Counſel and Decree of God) he made more of us, then theſe men do now we have a gratious being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a comfort to conſider, that God and we have been ſuch old friends, that he hath loved us from all eternity. For it is like the love will hold, that hath been of ſuch ſtanding. We have a Proverb, Change not an old friend for a new, becauſe the new is like to be more fickle. God hath been an old friend, time out of mind: And therefore he is like to be the more conſtant. From everlaſting he hath loved us, and therefore we may ſafely reſt and rely on his love.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God have loved us from everlaſting, then he hath loved us all along ſince that time. Before we had a being in the world, and ſince we had a being: before we had a gratious being, when we were dead in tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſes and ſins: And if he loved us then, aſſuredly he will not ceaſe to love us now, notwithſtanding all our unallowed imperfections and defects: He will continue and go on to love us ſtill, till he have lodged us with himſelf in glory.</p>
               <p>Oh how ſhould this revive the hearts of thoſe among the Saints, who are ſo apt to doubt the love of God, becauſe they ſin ſo often, and ſo much againſt him! Why man, God loved thee when thou didſt ſin againſt him more then now thou doſt; he loved thee when thou hatedſt him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly he will not hate thee now thou loveſt him. No, he that loved thee from the beginning, will love thee alſo to the end. He that loved thee from everlaſting, will love thee to everlaſting, <hi>and nothing in the world ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have at length diſpatched the body of our Saviours prayer, and are arrived at the cloſe or the concluſion of it: In which his drift and purpoſe is, to render his Diſciples (for whom he hath pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned all along before) very acceptable and very gratious to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo to leave them in his hands: And that upon this account, becauſe they only had the true and ſaving and affective knowledge of him; They only were acquainted with him, when as all the world beſide were ſtrangers to him. And it was reaſon he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do for them, then do for ſtrangers. <hi>Oh righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me, and I have declared unto them thy name. q. d.</hi> And now to ſhut up all, and to come to a concluſion, I pray thee Father to conſider this, for cloſe of all, That the world for whom I have not ſaid a word in all my prayer, nay for whom I have profeſſed not to pray, <hi>(I pray for theſe, I
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:46169:283"/>
pray not for the world)</hi> yet they (the world) are wholly ignorant of thee, and unacquainted with thee. But I that have put up this prayer to thee, know thee very well, no one in the world better. And they for whom I have put up this prayer, know thee too by my means, for I have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted and declared thee to them. And therefore I am confident, that thou wilt hear and anſwer me in their behalf: None know thee in the world but I and they: I that pray, and they for whom I pray. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that, and I have done: I ſay no more, but even leave thee to conſider whether thou wilt hear and anſwer me for them, or no, <hi>Oh righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In this concluſion of our Saviours prayer, I ſhall conſider but theſe two things: To whom he ſpeaks, and What he ſpeaks, for cloſe of all. Firſt, to whom he ſpeaks, and that you ſee my brethren, is to God, whom he ſtileth <hi>righteous Father.</hi> Secondly, what he ſpeaks in the remainder of the two verſes, which may be very well divided, by the ſubjects of his ſpeech, the perſons that he ſpeaks of, <hi>viz.</hi> the world, himſelf, and true believers, as we ſhall ſee at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>Begin we with the perſon that he ſpeaks to, and him he mentions by his title and his attribute. His title here you ſee is Father, his attribute is righteous, <hi>righteous Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe my brethren, I have ſhewed you more then once, that Father in this prayer of our Saviour is not perſonally taken for the firſt perſon of the Godhead: For the firſt perſon of the Godhead (though it be the Father of our Saviour Chriſt as God, yet) it is not ſo properly the Father of our Saviour Chriſt as man. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt ſpeaks as man in this place. And therefore Father here is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially taken for the whole Godhead ſubſiſting in the three perſons. And even as we, by Father, mean the Godhead when we pray our Father which art in heaven: So doth our Saviour Chriſt too. As man he is in this reſpect like us, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>he is in all things like unto us, ſin only excepted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the attribute he gives the Godhead, which he denotes by Father here, is righteous, <hi>Righteous Father.</hi> But wherefore doth he mention this, rather then any attribute of God, on this occaſion? Why might he not have ſaid as well Almighty, or Eternal, or Mercifull, or Gratious Father? The ſpecial reaſon why he chooſes this expreſſion (as far as I conceive) cannot be cleerly and undoubtedly reſolved. Judicious <hi>Calvin</hi> thinks he doth it in oppoſition to the unrighteouſneſs of men: So to comfort true believers, that however they were like to meet with nothing but injuſtice and unrighteouſneſs in the world, yet he was now committing them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands and keeping of a righteous God. Others gueſs at other reaſons. Once, this is clear and manifeſt, that he picks out this attribute of God among the reſt, and whereas many others lay before him, he fixes upon this only: He comes to God in prayer, by the name of <hi>righteous Father:</hi> The thing is evident, though the particular Conſideration that induced him to it be unknown. So that the Points to be obſerved here, are two.</p>
               <p>Firſt God is a juſt and righteous God in himſelf and in all his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:46169:283"/>Secondly, That Jeſus Chriſt came to him as a righteous God, when he was pouring out his prayers to him, or making his Petition to him.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> God is a very juſt and righteous God.</head>
                  <p>None knew him better then our Saviour, and he calls him <hi>Righteous Father:</hi> So doth the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture very often. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſtileth him <hi>The Righteous God,</hi> Pſal. 7.9 And <hi>Jeremiah, The Lord that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> Jer. 11.10. Indeed he doth not judge after the ſight of his eyes, nor reprove after the hearing of his ears; that is, he is not deceived with the external ſhew of things, with which the eyes of men are often taken. He is not miſled and carried with reports to deal unjuſtly in the leaſt degree: No, <hi>with righteouſneſs he doth judge the poor,</hi> (who many times are over-born in lower Courts, by thoſe that are too ſtrong and mighty for them) <hi>and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth:</hi> Though they be meek, though they be not clamorous and troubleſome, and though they do not wring out juſtice from him (as the poor widdow in the Goſpel did from the unrighteous Judge, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weariedneſs, earneſtneſs, and tyring importunity) yet they ſhall have it eaſily and readily, he will diſpenſe it to them freely of his own accord. And this is that which holy <hi>David</hi> ſo applauds him for, and he will have it ſpoken to his praiſe among the Heathen, Pſal. 96.10. <hi>Say among the Heathen, The Lord reigneth and he ſhall judge the people righteouſly. Let the Heavens rejoyce, and let the Earth be glad before the Lord, for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the Earth. He ſhall judge the world with Righteouſneſs, and his people with his Truth.</hi> So that you ſee the point is clear; That God is a very juſt and righteous God. And you will be the better ſatisfied in it; if you conſider but theſe three things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt the largeneſs of his Juriſdiction and Dominion: His Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is univerſal and extends to all the world, and therefore he muſt needs be righteous. He is the judge of all the earth: And what (ſaid <hi>Abraham) Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> Gen. 18.25. The Supream and Soveraign Judge before whoſe dread Tribunal all the World muſt ſtand, and at whoſe Bar they muſt be tryed for that which moſt concerns them too, their precious ſouls; from whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination no man can appeal with any hope of being righted in a higher Court, ſeeing there is none above it. <hi>Is God unrighteous?</hi> I ſay as the Apoſtle, Rom. 3.5. <hi>How then ſhall he judge the world?</hi> Indeed inferiour Governours may be unrighteous and corrupt, and yet this univerſal frame continue and ſubſiſt, becauſe they are perpetually ſubject to the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Judge, who <hi>ſtandeth in the Congregation of the Mighty, and is a Judge among the Gods,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, Pſal. 82.1. But if the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Judge ſhould be unjuſt, whom none can over-top nor call to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, what could be lookt for but confuſion?</p>
                  <p>Another ground of the righteouſneſs of God, is the immenſity and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> infiniteneſs of his preſence. As he is Governour and Judge of all the world, ſo he is in all the world. The largeneſs of his preſence is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:46169:284"/>

Inferiour Magiſtrates, although perhaps they have no mind to be unjuſt, yet they are often times miſled by ſiniſter information. They are not preſent everywhere, they ſee not every thing themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are neceſſitated to proceed <hi>ſecundum allegata &amp; probata.</hi> And many times it comes to paſs, that things which are untrue are teſtified and proved before them, and ſo they do <hi>injuſtum,</hi> though not <hi>injuſtè,</hi> by means of which the Innocent is injured and oppreſſed; See an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it in <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> who by the falſe ſuggeſtions of his wicked ſervant <hi>Ziba,</hi> was outed of his goods and his poſſeſſions, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.4. Had <hi>David</hi> known that good <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> had ſtill remained loyal to him, had he not been abuſed by a forged information, how far would he have been from doing ſuch apparent wrong as he did in that ſentence? But he relyed on Teſtimony for the truth of that which by reaſon of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs could not fall within the compaſs of his own notice, and ſo was led into that groſs miſtake which you have heard. Now there can no ſuch Errors happen in the Government of God, becauſe himſelf is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every where, and therefore cannot be miſguided by finiſter infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. He taketh nothing upon truſt, upon ſuggeſtion, as all our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours on earth do. No, my beloved, he ſees all with his own eyes, he hears all with his own ears: nothing is ſaid or done but in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>His eyes in every place behold the evil and the good,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 15.3. whether it be good or evil, whether it be near or far off, it is within his own veiw, his eyes behold it, he need not to depend upon a witneſs for the proof of it: So that in this reſpect he is not ſubject to ſuch injuſtice in his government as other Kings and Rulers are.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God muſt needs be righteous in his Adminiſtrations, becauſe he is inclined to it by his inward Diſpoſition: he hath a ſelf propenſity to righteous dealing; <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 11.7. his very heart is ſet upon it; as he acteth without, ſo he affecteth it within. There are many in the world that do juſtice, who yet do not love juſtice: They execute it out of Politick reſpects and reaſons only, or out of affectation of applauſe with men, not out of inward inclination and affection. The Judge of whom our Saviour Chriſt makes mention, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.2. did the poor widdow juſtice; and yet he calls him an unjuſt Judge, becauſe he did not execute it out of love to juſtice, but himſelf; To wit, that he might quit himſelf, and rid his hands of the unwearied importunities of ſuch a ſutor as would not give him reſt till he had done it: <hi>Becauſe this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her;</hi> not becauſe her cauſe is juſt: His aim was not to do her right, but obtain his own quiet. But herein God excells; he doth juſtice, and that becauſe he loves juſtice: He doth not execute it by compulſion and conſtraint, or out of by-ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ends: but out of the affection that he bears it, and the dear regard he hath to it. And this is that which he profeſſeth of himſelf, Iſai. 16.8. <hi>I the Lord love judgement.</hi>

His righteouſneſs lies at ſtake for all thoſe, by reaſon of his Covenant and Engagement to us. Indeed before he made the Covenant he was free, he might have done according to his own pleaſure; But having made it, he is bound, he is held to it, and may not vary. Now he muſt forgive our ſins, or elſe he is unrighteous, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> inſinuates in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is faithful and juſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſins.</hi> Now he muſt reward our labours, or elſe he is unjuſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, Heb. 6.10. <hi>The Lord is not unrighteous to forget our work and labour:</hi> He doth not ſay, the Lord is not unmerciful, but <hi>the Lord is not unrighteous;</hi> Now he muſt give us everlaſting reſt, and render everlaſting trouble to our enemies, and that upon the ſame ground: And therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 2 Theſ. 1.6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with him to render tribulation to them that trouble you; and to you that are troubled reſt with us;</hi> So that you ſee the juſtice, and the righteouſneſs of God, which is a ground of horrour to the wicked; yet it is a ground of comfort to the godly.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, This is the ready way to ſettle, and eſtabliſh and confirm this to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Nation when it ſhakes, and when it is about to fall. Juſtice upholds
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:46169:286"/>
the pillars of it; It is <hi>Columna &amp; corona Reipublicae.</hi> There are at this time many things in agitation, and many ways and projects thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſettle Government among us: But when we have run through them all, we ſhall find in the concluſion that nothing in the world will do it like to righteouſneſs. Let the form, and let the frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be what it will, the Throne muſt be eſtabliſht by righteouſneſs; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially when it is firſt ſet up. Juſtice is as neceſſary to confirm a new Government, as Miracles to confirm a new Doctrine. And if the people find not this, if there be tyranny, injuſtice, and oppreſſion ſtill, that which made the old unpleaſing, will have the ſame effect and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the new.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Righteouſneſs in your Adminiſtrations will make you aimable in the ſight of God; as God himſelf is righteous, ſo he loveth righteouſneſs; as he acteth it himſelf, ſo he affecteth it in others. <hi>The righteous Lord</hi> (ſaith holy <hi>David) loveth righteouſneſs, his countenance doth behold the upright,</hi> Pſal. 11.7. Righteous he is in all his actings and adminiſtrations; he is the righteous Lord: ſo righteous and ſo juſt, that there is none in that reſpect like him: and that out of a principle of love within: the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs; yea, he affecteth it, and loves it ſo, that he gives no man a good countenance, or a good look ſo much, that is not juſt and righteous too: his countenance doth behold the upright, the upright and none elſe. But as for thoſe that are unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, he abhors them, all of them without exception, he <hi>hateth all workers of iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 5.5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As it will make you amiable in the eyes of God, ſo you will find it to be very beneficial to your ſelves: They are precious promiſes that God makes, and great rewards that he gives to thoſe that love and do Juſtice. That is a ſignal one, Iſa. 33.15. <hi>He that walketh righteouſly and ſpeaks uprightly; he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſsion, and ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes;</hi> ſo that it any put a bribe into his hand before he be aware, he ſhakes it out again, and doth not hold it: <hi>he ſhall dwell on high, his place of defence ſhall be the munition of the Rocks: bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure:</hi> He ſhall have honor, <hi>he ſhall dwell on high,</hi> he ſhall be lifted up above his brethren: He ſhall have ſure protection, <hi>his defence ſhall be the munition of the Rocks;</hi> high, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my can never reach him, and high upon <hi>the Rock,</hi> that he cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine him. And as he ſhall have honor and protection, ſo he ſhall have proviſion too, <hi>bread ſhall be given him,</hi> and full proviſion; he ſhall have bread and water too, and this ſhall be ſure to him; <hi>Bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as there is much promiſed to, ſo there hath been much done for thoſe who have laid out themſelves in doing juſtice. You know how <hi>Jehu</hi> ſped, and yet he did it in hypocriſie. The Kingdom was continued in his line to the fourth generation. <hi>Phineas</hi> it ſeems was more upright, and therefore he had a reward that laſted longer, Numb. 25.13. <hi>He ſhall have and his ſeed after him the Covenant of an everlaſting Prieſthhod, becauſe he was zealous for his God,</hi> to wit, in executing juſtice on that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious pair of foul offenders; Indeed the recompence of him that doth
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:46169:287"/>
it in ſincerity, ſhall laſt for ever; For he ſhall dwell upon Gods holy Mountain, he ſhall receive an <hi>Euge,</hi> when the great day of reckoning cometh.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of the firſt concluſion, God is a very juſt and righteous God. I ſhall ſpeak very little to the ſecond, becauſe indeed it is not large: however I ſhall touch it in a word or two.</p>

The meditation of the righteouſneſs of God, will humble us for ſin, and ſtir us up (as far as it is poſſible) to cleanſe our ſelves from ſin, when we are making our approaches to him: For ſin, my Brethren, is againſt the righteouſneſs of God; yea in directeſt oppoſition: And therefore it is ſet out by the name of <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> in Scripture. Not only all injuſtice is unrighteouſneſs, but ſin is generally ſo; <hi>The wrath of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is revealed from heaven, againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> Rom. 1.18. againſt every kind of ſin, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that violates the ſecond Table. And ſo <hi>all unrighteouſneſs is ſin,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17. And I may ſay as well, all ſin is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. And hence it is my Brethren, that it is ſo infinitely odious to the righteous God.</p>
                  <p>And truly did we ſeriouſly conſider this my Brethren, when we come to pray before him, we ſhould be deeply humbled for it, and
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:46169:287"/>
aſhamed of it, we ſhould ſtrive exceedingly to quit and rid our ſelves of it, which is ſo contrary to this attribute of his, and conſequently is ſo deteſtable to him. Oh we would ſhake and quiver every joynt, to think of coming to the righteous God in our unrighteouſneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled for, and unreformed. We would conſider with our ſelves, What will the Lord ſay to me when he ſees me in his preſence? How will he look on ſuch a wicked and unrighteous wretch as I am? how is it poſſible but he ſhould hide his eyes from me? how can he chooſe but hate me and abhor me? Do I expect to find favour in his eyes, and come before him with that which he ſo abhors, as if I meant to vex him, and provoke him? And therefore if we ever look to ſpeed with God in prayer, let us conſider what a righteous God he is, and let us labour to cleanſe our ſelves from our unrighteouſneſs, that is, as far as it is poſſible from every ſin, and he will receive us, as his own expreſſion is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. or otherwiſe he will not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The meditation of the righteouſneſs of God, will ſtrengthen and confirm our faith, in all the pretious promiſes of God, when we are pouring out our prayers to him: Becauſe indeed his righteouſneſs and juſtice lies at ſtake for the performance of his promiſes, by reaſon of his Covenant and Engagement to us. It is true, before he made the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant he was free, he might have done according to his own pleaſure: But having made it, he is bound, he is held to it, and may not vary. Now he muſt forgive our ſins, (ours that believe) or elſe he is unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> inſinuates, 1 Joh. 1.19. <hi>He is faithful and juſt to forgive our ſins:</hi> Now he muſt reward our labour, or elſe he is unrighteous, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, Heb. 6.10. <hi>The Lord is not unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to forget your work and labour.</hi> He doth not ſay, the Lord is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, but <hi>the Lord is not unrighteous:</hi> Now he muſt give us ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reſt, and render everlaſting trouble to our enemies, or elſe he is unrighteous: And therefore ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 2 Theſſ. 1.6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to render tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled, reſt with us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore when we pray for the pardon of our ſins, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our labours, or any other good thing comprehended in the Covenant, from the beginning of it to the end: Let us fix our ſerious thoughts, not only on the mercy, but alſo on the juſtice and the righteouſneſs of God, and we ſhall find it will exceedingly confirm our wavering faith, while we conſider that his righteouſneſs is bound for the performance of his promiſes; and that as ſure as God is righteous, he will with-hold no good thing from us.</p>

               <p>OUR Saviour having ended the petitionary part, is at length come to the concluſion of his prayer: In which he ſhews the Father rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he ſhould be heard in all that he hath been a Suitor for in the behalf of true believers. <hi>(viz:)</hi> Becauſe himſelf and they were inwardly acquainted with him, whereas all the world beſides were ſtrangers to him, as I have noted heretofore.</p>
               <p>In this concluſion of our Saviours prayer, have been conſidered two things. To whom he ſpeaks, and What he ſpeaks. Firſt, To whom he ſpeaks, and this you ſee my brethren, is to God, whom he ſtileth <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father.</hi> Secondly then in the next place, What he ſpeaks; and here is ſomething that he ſpeaks againſt the world, and ſomething that he ſpeaks for himſelf and true believers. 1. Here is ſomething that he ſpeaks againſt the world, <hi>the world hath not known thee.</hi> 2. Then here is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he ſpeaks for himſelf and true believers, <hi>but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whom our Saviour ſpeaks as he is ſet forth by his title and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, hath been conſidered heretofore. The thing which we have now in hand, is what he ſpeaks, and more particularly what he ſpeaks againſt the world. <hi>Oh Righteous Father, the world hath not known thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have obſerved heretofore out of the ninth verſe of this Chapter that he ſpeaks not for the world. No, it is utterly excluded from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any ſhare at all in our Saviours interceſſion: let their caſe be what it will, let their neceſſities be what they will, Chriſt even leaves them to themſelves, and never interpoſes for them to the Father. Nay, which is worſe, he ſpeaks againſt them. He ſpeaks againſt the world, as you hear him in my text. You ſee he cannot end his prayer, but he muſt have a parting blow at them <hi>(Oh righteous Father, the world hath not known thee,)</hi> to kindle and exaſperate his wrath againſt them. It hath not known thee with a knowledge of affection; they have not known thee ſo as to love thee and obey thee. They are ſtrangers, yea, they are enemies to thee. Let juſtice have its courſe againſt them, let it be executed on them to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>This I have glanced at only from the general, that Chriſt ſpeaks againſt the world. Proceed we more particularly to conſider what he ſpeaks againſt the world. <hi>Oh Righteous Father, the world hath not known thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall unfold the terms, and come to a more ſpecial obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Two things we have to be enquired and reſolved. 1. Whom our Saviour means by world. 2. What he intendeth when he affirmeth of the world, that it doth not know God.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe, The world imports not here the frame and frabrique of the world (as it doth ſometimes in Scripture) but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the world. And yet not all the people of the world neither: for
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:46169:288"/>
Jeſus Chriſt immediately excepts himſelf and true believers. <hi>The world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known thee,</hi> The world you ſee is ſet in oppoſition here to Chriſt and his Diſciples. So that our Saviour by the world intends all the people in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf and true believers.</p>
               <p>Now of all theſe he ſaith expreſly that they know not God. You muſt not underſtand it abſolutely, that they know him not at all, in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and under no conſideration. The very Heathen know him in a ſenſe and in a meaſure. There is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſomewhat to be known of God, by the works of the creation, and by the things that he hath made, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. even by the book of Creatures which the Heathens have and ſtudy. And therefore it is charged upon them afterwards at <hi>ver.</hi> 21. <hi>that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God;</hi> They did not glorifie him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their knowledge of him. And if the Heathen, who have but the Book of Creatures, know the Lord a little; Profeſſed Chriſtians, who have the Book of Scriptures, know him more. I ſay, profeſſed Chriſtians who have no intereſt at all in Chriſt, no truth of ſaving grace in them, even theſe may go far in a notional, ſpeculative, diſcourſive knowledge of the Lord, beyond many ſound believers: and yet theſe are of the world. So that our Saviour means not abſolutely when he ſaith to his Father here, <hi>The world hath not known thee, q. d.</hi> they have not known thee at all: But they have not known thee ſo, in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a kind of knowledge as I and true believers do. <hi>Oh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me, and I have declared unto them thy name,</hi> all that is neceſſary to be known of thee.</p>
               <p>You ſee the meaning of the words, The world here is oppoſed to Jeſus Chriſt and true believers: So that it is not <hi>mundus mundus,</hi> but <hi>mundus immundus,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it. It is the unbelieving and unſanctified world, ſaith our Saviour, knows not God. He means not, that they know him not at all, but they know him not aright.</p>
               <p>How and in what reſpects they know him not a right, I ſhall open by and by; In the mean time the Point is this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That unbelievers and unſanctified perſons know not God, at leaſt they know him not in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a knowledge as they ought to do.</head>
                  <p>This is the uſual Character of ſuch in Scripture: This is the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of unbelieving Heathens, <hi>they are the Gentiles that know not God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.5. This is the Character of unbelieving Chriſtians, <hi>they know not God, and obey not the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.8. So that all unbelieving and unſanctified perſons, whether they be Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens or profeſſed Chriſtians, are ignorant of God: yea though they diſcourſe of him, and that excellently too, and pretend acquaintance with him, as thoſe whom the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>They profeſs
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:46169:289"/>
they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> Yea, though they cry to God, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>my God, we know thee,</hi> while they caſt off the thing that is good; Hoſea 8.2, 3. yet they know not God indeed. Their knowledge of him is not right and ſound, and conſequently is not worthy of the name of knowledge, as I ſhall evidently clear it to you in a few parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Unbelievers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> know not God in ſuch a manner, and with ſuch a kind of knowledge as they ought to do, in that they know him not with an affective knowledge, ſo as to love him and delight in him. Knowledge in Scripture doth connote affection: and that which carries not the heart and the affections with it, deſerveth not the name of knowledge. And therefore men are frequently affirmed in Scripture, not to know that which they do not like and love. <hi>The Ox knows his owner,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but</hi> Iſrael <hi>knows not me,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. Why certainly they knew him, if any people under Heaven knew him with a diſcurſive and a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative knowledge. I but they knew him not with an affective knowledge: Their knowledge of him drew not out their hearts to him, and therefore in the Lords interpretation and conſtruction, it was no knowledge: For he ſaith of them expreſly, <hi>Iſrael hath not known me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In that they know him not with an effective knowledge ſo as to ſerve him and obey him: with ſuch a knowledge as brings forth practice and obedience. That which is ſeparate from this, is no knowledge. In which reſpect it is that the Apoſtle ſtiles it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. <hi>A form of knowledge.</hi> There is the ſhew, but not the truth. When Chriſt is ſaid in Scripture to have known no ſin, we cannot underſtand it to be meant of intellectual knowledge, for then he could not have diſcourſed of it; ſo that he <hi>knew no ſin,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> is, <hi>he did no ſin,</hi> in <hi>Peter.</hi> They that knew God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. becauſe they did not live accordingly, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified him not as God, are therefore ſaid not to have kept him and <hi>retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in their knowledge,</hi> ver. 28. <hi>God made his wayes and ſtatutes known to</hi> Iſrael, <hi>he dealt not ſo with any Nation.</hi> And yet even of them he ſaith, <hi>It is a people that do err in their hearts, and they have not known my wayes,</hi> Pſal. 95.10. Brethren, there is an error in the heart as well as in the brain; and a kind of ignorance ariſing from the will, as well as from the underſtanding, and this takes off the name of knowledge from that which is but ſpeculation only. And therefore ſinners are univerſally termed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ignorant, erring perſons,</hi> Heb. 5.2. And that alone is (by the Holy Ghoſt) thought worthy of the name of knowledge, that ſinketh from the brain into the heart, and ſo appeareth in the life, ſetting all on work for God: In which reſpect it is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of the Lord with his people <hi>that he will put his Law into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and write it in their hearts.</hi> Not in their minds and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings only the ſeat and principle of ſpeculation; but in their hearts the principle of action; So that they ſhall not only have it in their minds to know it, but in their hearts to practice it, and to obey it. This, only this is right knowledge. <hi>A good underſtanding have all they that do his Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119.10. They only underſtand and know the Lord effectually, and ſavingly, that obey the will of God. Hereby we know
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:46169:289"/>
we know him (as we ought to do) if we keep his Commandments. Others may have underſtanding, only theſe have good underſtanding. For this God ſets the finger of a hand againſt <hi>Joſiah,</hi> to point him out to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial obſervation, Jer. 22.16. <hi>He judged the cauſe of the poor and needy; was not this to know me? ſaith the Lord. q. d.</hi> This was knowledge to the purpoſe, this was true and real knowledge of the Lord indeed. which made him ſtrict and carefull in the performance of his duty.</p>
                  <p>In that that they know him not in Chriſt: and to know God out <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of Chriſt is all one as not to know him, as I have ſhewed at large out of the third verſe of this Chapter. This ſhall ſuffice for clearing of the Obſervation, That unbelievers and unſanctified perſons know not God: At leaſt they know him not in ſuch a manner and with ſuch a kind of knowledge as they ought to do: in that they know him not with an affective knowledge, they know him not with an effective knowledge, and they know him not in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But what may be the cauſes why the unbelieving world is ſo ignorant <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> of God? I ſhall lay them open to you both with relation to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving world Heathen, and with relation to the unbelieving world Chriſtian; Chriſtian I mean in name, though not in truth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the unbelieving world Heathen, it is no wonder that they know not God, for they have no means to know him in ſuch a manner as is neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Its true that even they have means to know him in a common way, as the Apoſtle ſhews and proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. That which may be known (conceive it naturally known) of God, is manifeſt to them, that is, the Heathen, for God hath ſhewed it even to them; There is an Image and reſemblance of him ſtampt upon the Creatures. There are apparent characters, and footſteps and impreſſions of the Godhead, of his power and wiſdom, ſet upon every thing which he hath made, which may be looked upon by every eye. How doth his glory ſhine, my brethren, in the rare and admirable ſtructure of the world, the glorious frame of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth! And hence it is that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 19.1. Indeed he tells us afterwards, the <hi>Law of the Lord is perfect.</hi> The word of God, and that alone, is a compleat and perfect help to bring us to the knowledge of God. But yet there is ſome declaration of him in the Creatures, <hi>the Heavens declare the glory of God.</hi> And this means the Heathens have.</p>
                  <p>The Creatures catechiſe them and inſtruct them in the knowledge of a God, as <hi>Job</hi> ſhewes, Chap. 12.7. <hi>Ask now the Beaſts and they ſhall teach thee, the Fowls and they ſhall tell thee, ſpeak to the Earth and it ſhall teach thee, and Fiſhes of the Sea ſhall declare to thee. Who knoweth not in all theſe that the hand of God hath wrought this?</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle tells us <hi>that even they the Heathen knew God,</hi> Rom. 1.21.</p>
                  <p>But now they have no means to know him ſavingly in Chriſt; <hi>And this is life eternal, to know thee the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> This knowledge is not written in the Creature Book, and they have not the Scripture Book, and how then ſhould they come to it? Its true that God is written in the Creature Book, but not a word of Chriſt
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:46169:290"/>
there. God is written in the Heart Book, but not a word of Chriſt there neither; <hi>The Law is written in the heart by nature, but there are no impreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel, which is the word of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 3.16. And hence it is that all the Nations of the world have groped after God and found him too, as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27. Let a man run from Eaſt to Weſt, let him ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake all Nations, and where he findeth any men, there he ſhall find ſome notice of God.</p>
                  <p>But now, my Brethren, among which of all theſe Nations, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had the book of Scriptures, ſhall you find any notice of a Chriſt, any incling of a Saviour or Redeemer! No, Chriſt is not ſo much as named among them, They have no glimpſe, no crevice, to give them any light of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>So that it is no wonder, though the unbelieving world Pagan know him not in this manner, for they have no means to know him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> But now the unbelieving world Chriſtian hath the means of this knowledge, and why then do not they know God? true, they have the outward means, but they want the inward means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> They have the outward revelation of the word, but they have not the inward revelation of the ſpirit. <hi>And without this it is impoſsible for any man to know God.</hi> And therefore the Apoſtle prays for the Epheſians that God would <hi>give them the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.</hi> Chap. 1.17. By which he intimates that without ſpirit-revelation they could never come to know him.</p>
                  <p>Now this ſpirit-revelation, or unveiling, conſiſts in the removal of a double Veil: the Veil that lies upon the faculty, and the Veil that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Object.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the ſpirit-revelation, which is the only means of knowing God, there muſt be the removal of the Veil that lies upon the faculty, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. The ſence muſt be unveiled, you know, or elſe we cannot ſee an object, though it be before us. For what can a blindfolded perſon ſee? And ſo it is in this caſe: for every unbelieving perſon is blindfolded as it were: <hi>the God of this world hath blinded his eyes: The Veil is on their heart,</hi> that is their underſtanding, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 15. And this Veil the Holy Ghoſt muſt take away; as in the cited place, or elſe though God be by a man, (as certainly he is not far from every one of us) he will not ſee him. But when once this is removed, then <hi>revelata ac detecta facie,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> reads it, <hi>Then we with open and uncovered face behold the glory of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In that ſpirit-revelation, which is the only means of knowing God, there muſt be the removal of the Veil that lies upon the Object; as of the Veil that lies upon the underſtanding, ſo of the Veil that lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Goſpel, where God is repreſented to us in a ſaving way. For you muſt know (my brethren) that the Goſpel is a veiled and a covered thing, it hath a Curtain drawn before it: It is a myſterie, a ſecret thing. Nay it is not only ſecret in it ſelf, but it is alſo kept ſecret. Nor <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, for that is the term that the Apoſtle uſes, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.26. Not ſimply dark, or myſtical, but hid on purpoſe, <hi>de induſtria,</hi> as <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacta</hi> obſerves. Among the Jews it was covered with a veil of types
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:46169:290"/>
and figures and dark expreſſions: And to this day it is hid from natural and carnal men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. So that however God in Chriſt be cleerly manifeſted there, let them do what they are able, ſtill there is ſomething between them and God that hides him from them, that they cannot ſee him. And that is the firſt reaſon, why unbelieving Chriſtians know not God, becauſe they want the inward means of this knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-revelation.</p>
                  <p>And as they want the inward means of finding out this knowledge,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when it is cloſely hidden and covered from them: ſo they want inward capability of receiving this knowledge when it is openly propoſed and tendred to them. They are ſo far from being able to go forth to fetch it from abroad, that they cannot entertain it when it is brought home to them: They have not of themſelves by nature ſo much as a receptivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or an immediate paſſive capability of ſaving knowledge.

                  <p n="1">1. In every unbeliever there is ſomewhat that repells divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that keeps out the beams of truth. And that is carnal reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and carnal wiſdom, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. The wondrous perſpicuity and ſharpneſs of conceit that is in any man (that is but fleſh) is ſo far from helping him to know God, that it doth but hinder him. And the ground is evident; for ſuch a perſon leanes to his own wiſdom, he doth not yield himſelf up to be taught of God, but weighs thoſe things that are divine and ſupernatural in the ballance of his reaſon. As far as that will reach, he is content to go: And where that faileth him (as infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort it falls) there he deſiſts: and what he is unable to perceive by this, is fooliſhneſs to him, as 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him.</hi> They are not ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in themſelves, they are but ſo to him. He is too wiſe to take in ſuch fooliſh things: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>not many wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.16. and tells us plainly, that if we ever mean to attain to ſaving knowledge, <hi>we muſt be renewed in the ſpirit of our mind,</hi> Eph. 1.24. that is, in the higheſt, pureſt and the moſt refined part of it. As ſpirits are the quinteſſence of things, that are moſt abſtract from droſs, and that have leaſt of earth in them; Even theſe muſt be renewed, or ſaving knowledge will not be received.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In every unbeliever and unſanctified perſon, as there is ſomething redundant, that repells divine knowledge; ſo there is ſomething wanting to receive it, and that is the ſpirit of God. Saving truths are often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the things of the ſpirit, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Now (my beloved) the things of our own ſpirits (carnal, natural and worldly things) our own ſpirits will take in: but the things of Gods ſpirit, Gods ſpirit only will take in. Though they be brought home to our doors, if Gods ſpirit be not there to take them in if he be not at home to entertain them, and receive them, it is all to no purpoſe. And this is the caſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man: he hath not the ſpirit of God, and therefore he receiveth not the things of the ſpirit, becauſe he hath no principle within him that is agreeable and ſuitable unto them. And this is that which the Apoſtle
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:46169:291"/>
aims at, when he ſaith, <hi>we ſpeak wiſdom to them that are perfect,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.6. That is, to them that have all the parts of a ſpiritual man (whereof the ſpirit is the principal) <hi>the doctrine which we teach is accounted wiſdom.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the animal man, the ſouly man, the man that hath a ſoul indeed, but no ſpirit, (I mean none of Gods ſpirit) he perceives not theſe things, nor can he know them. And why ſo? becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. And he poor man, hath not the ſpirit to diſcern them by. And therefore though he hear the words of God and Chriſt, he never knows the mind of God or Chriſt, as it is added in the end of that Chapter.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I ſhall add but one reaſon more; unbelievers and unſanctified perſons know not God, becauſe as they are of themſelves unable, (in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which have been mentioned) ſo they are unwilling alſo to know God; They will not underſtand, <hi>Pſal</hi> 82.5.

They had him there, but they liked not to retain him, they had no mind to keep him there: feign they would put him out again, the apprehenſion of a God called upon them for love and duty and obedience, and was a curb and a reſtraint from many evils, and therefore they were weary of ſuch thoughts as thoſe, and ſought to chaſe them from their minds. To ſay the truth, they did not like them, and therefore would be rid of them: And thus it is with many Chriſtians.

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt, and he alone knows God immediately, and others know him by the means of Chriſt.</head>
                  <p>All ſaving knowledge of the Father comes out by Jeſus Chriſt to his people Chriſt knows him firſt, and then we know him in the ſecond place by him. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time,</hi> John 1.18. What then? is he not to be ſeen or known at all by any means? Yes, though he be not to be ſeen or known by us immediately in himſelf, yet mediately in and by the Son he may be known: for he hath manifeſted and revealed him to us. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time. The only begotten Son which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath declared him.</hi> Indeed it was the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for which our Saviour came into this lower world, to bring God down to us, that we might be acquainted with him. <hi>Ye neither know me nor my Father,</hi> ſaith our Saviour to the Jews, John 8.19. <hi>If ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo. q. d.</hi> I would have brought you to the knowledge of my Father. And as the Book in <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.9. had ſtill remained a ſealed Book, unleſs the Lamb had opened it: ſo God had ſtill remained a concealed God: he had never been diſcovered and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to us in a ſaving way, unleſs the Son himſelf had done it. So that the Point is plain you ſee, That Jeſus Chriſt, and he alone knows God immediately, and others know him by the means of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the firſt place, this may ſerve for information, to let <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> us ſee, that no man can be ſaved by his own innate knowledge, nor by the light that is naturally in him, let him uſe it how he will, or how he can; There hath been an opinion vented up and down of late, that any man that walks according to his principles, according to the imbred light he hath, let this light be what it will, and of what kind it will, he may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to happineſs and glory in the end: And ſo by conſequence, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Mahometans, and Infidels of any ſort, may be ſaved if they pleaſe. All men have light enough (ſay they) if they improve and uſe it as they ought to do, to bring them to be atitude: whereas indeed no man hath light enough to bring him ſavingly to know God. Jeſus Chriſt and he alone knows God immediately, and others know him by the means of Chriſt: So that unleſs he ſhew the Father to us, unleſs he undertake himſelf to teach us and inſtruct us, we muſt continue ignorant of God, and ſo there is no other way but we muſt periſh and be loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt and he alone knows God immediately, and <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> others know him by the means of Chriſt? You ſee, my brethren, then, what courſe you are to take, if you deſire to know God, to be acquainted with the Father: You muſt go to Jeſus Chriſt for information, and uſe his help in this buſineſs. If you ever ſee God, if you ever come to have the ſaving knowledge of his name, believe it, Jeſus Chriſt muſt manifeſt it and declare it to you. If he conceal the Father from you, nay if he do not ſhew him to you, you can never come to know him. All other means that you can uſe, ſearching in the Book of the Creatures, yea in
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:46169:293"/>
the book of the Scriptures, hearing, reading, meditation will be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, unleſs Chriſt ſtrike in with them: When you have done your utmoſt, you will die in ignorance of God, and ſo be loſt to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And therefore I beſeech you my Beloved, betake your ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt the great Prophet of the Church, be his Diſciples, learn of him. Tell him that he knows the Father, as he profeſſeth in my Text, and ſo beſeech him earneſtly to make him known to you, that you may alſo be acquainted with him. Pray him as <hi>Philip</hi> doth, Joh. 14.8. <hi>Lord, ſhew us the Father and it ſufficeth us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus far we have ſeen to whom our Saviour ſpeaks, and what he ſpeaks. In the firſt place againſt the world, and in the ſecond place for himſelf and true believers; <hi>Oh righteous Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee, and theſe have known that thou haſt ſent me.</hi> They have been throughly perſwaded that I am a Meſſenger, and an Embaſſador ſent forth from thee, to manifeſt thy Nature, and thy Will to them.</p>
                  <p>Now in the following verſe he comes to ſhew that he hath been, and will be faithful in the delivery of the meſſage which his Father ſent him in, together with the reaſon of it. Firſt, he declares that he hath been, and will be faithful in the delivery of the meſſage which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent him in; <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it.</hi> Secondly, he ſhews the reaſon of it, why he hath been, and will be ſo; <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Begin we with the firſt of theſe, in which our Saviour ſhews; Firſt That he hath been faithful; then that he will be faithful as the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger of God. Firſt that he hath been faithful; <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name;</hi> But this is for the ſenſe, and almoſt for the words, the very ſame that he had ſaid before in the 6. verſe of this Chapter. There it is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and ſo accordingly there it is rendred <hi>I have manifeſted thy Name,</hi> here <hi>I have declared thy Name.</hi> The phraſe is varyed, but the ſenſe is one. And therefore I ſhall wholly wave it here, and paſs from that which Chriſt hath done, to that which he will further do, of which he makes no mention in the former verſe; <hi>I have declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them thy Name, and will declare it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether this reſolution of our Saviour to make a further declaration of his Fathers Name, relate to his Apoſtles and Diſciples then about him only: or elſe to ſuch as ſhould believe in after times to the end of the world, is all the difficulty in the words; whether his meaning be, <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name,</hi> to thoſe Apoſtles and Diſciples, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with me, <hi>and will declare it:</hi> that is, I will declare it further to them, to the very ſame men: Or whether it be rather this, <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name,</hi> to them that are now about me; <hi>and will declare it</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, that in after ages ſhall come in to me. I have declared it unto theſe by my own immediate voyce, and will declare it unto others, by them and their ſucceſſors to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>As for my own part, I ſee no reaſon why either of theſe Expoſitions ſhould be laid aſide, ſeeing both of them agree with the Analogy of
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:46169:293"/>
Faith, and with the ſcope and ſeries of the Text. And ſince it is moſt conſonant to the accompliſhment and execution of the Prophetical of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chriſt, to be continually teaching thoſe that are beſtowed upon him by the Father, in all Ages, Teaching them further whom he hath begun to teach, and teaching other men anew, to the end of the world.</p>

And ſo accordingly he did aſſoon as he was riſen from the dead, <hi>He ſhewed himſelf alive to them, being ſeen of them forty days together,</hi> Act. 1.3. And what did he in that time? Why he inſtructed them in things concerning God, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as you may ſee in that place. And when he was aſcended into Heaven, he was mindful of his promiſe, which he had often made to them, and ſo accordingly diſpatched the Holy Spirit down among
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:46169:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them to lead them further onward in the knowledge of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the beſt are Novices in this regard, they have not yet attained to a perfect man in point of holy and divine knowledge, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. It is true, there is a great deal of variety among the Saints, aſwell in this as other graces, <hi>according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.7. But in the beſt it is a meaſure, and no more; it is not fulneſs and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He that hath moſt of God revealed to him, yet knows him but in part; and he that hath the cleareſt ſight of him, ſees him but darkly in a glaſs, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. And therefore this is called the ſeeing of the back parts of the Lord; as when we ſee the back parts of a man, we know him but by gueſs only: we know him not ſo perfectly and ſo diſtinctly as when we come to ſee his face. Such a ſight of God it is that we attain in this world. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who in this point of holy and divine knowledge was not behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles, who had his Raptures and his Extaſies, and who was taken up into the third Heaven, and had ſuch things revealed to him as were not to be uttered by the tongue of man, profeſſeth notwithſtanding that he had not yet attained, nor was he yet perfect, <hi>But,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I follow after, that I may apprehend,</hi> Phil. 3.12. So that he was <hi>Viator,</hi> and not <hi>Comprehenſor;</hi> he was in the condition that the people were, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. he followed on to know the Lord. The people of <hi>Coloſs</hi> were eminent for grace and knowledge, and yet for them it is the Apoſtle prays, <hi>That they might increaſe in the knowledg of God,</hi> Col. 1.10. So that the point is plain, as you ſee; They that have the Name of God, his Nature and his Will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But why have they who have the Name of God ſavingly declared to
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:46169:294"/>
them, defects and imperfections in their knowledge? Why doth not Jeſus Chriſt in whom are hidden all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that for the accommodation of his members, furniſh and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them? Why doth he not aſſoon as he begins to teach them, declare all his Fathers Name to them, but keeps back ſomething ſtill, for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery? There are two ſpecial reaſons of it, to name no more at this time.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not ſhew them all at once, becauſe they are not capable of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it: A ſcholar is not capable of all he is to learn at firſt daſh. He cannot take in all at once, even in his firſt leſſon; and hence his Maſter leads him onward by degrees: firſt gives him eaſier, and after brings him on to harder Leſſons: Even ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt with his ſcholars; he goes along with every one as he can learn, as he is able to receive it in. He doth not ſhew them all his Fathers glory at a clap, for that he knows would dazle them, and over-whelm them; but lets in now a little light upon them, and then a little more, as he perceives their ſenſes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed: Inſtils into their minds and underſtandings the knowledge of his Father by degrees; and as by learning their capacities are widened, ſo he goes on to further diſcoveries. This courſe he took with the Apoſtles; what they were able to receive he taught them out of hand, but reſerved other things, as you may ſee, Joh. 16.12. <hi>I have many things to ſay unto you, but you cannot bear them now;</hi> I am to ſay them, <hi>but you cannot bear them now,</hi> and therefore I will take ſome other time to reveal thoſe things to you.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not ſhew them all at once, that he may keep his Saints <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> humble. As long as there is fleſh and nature in us, (as there will be while we remain in this world) high meaſures and degrees of knowledge may exalt us, and lift us up above our ſelves: And therefore Jeſus Chriſt in love and wiſdom uſes to beſtow upon his people ſo much knowledge as he ſees fit for them. A little more, it may be, would undo them: They would ſet their hearts it may be as the heart of God himſelf: They would be as Gods knowing good and evil: Shrewd fellows in their own conceits, none to be compared with them. In which reſpect he dealeth with us as God with <hi>Jacob;</hi> he gave him a gift, but left behind him a lameneſs withall that accompanyed the gift: So Chriſt beſtows upon us ſome degrees of knowledge, but leaves withal ſome imperfections and defects, that we may be kept humble, and that we may not ſwell with ſelf-attributions.</p>
                  <p>Now to deſcend to Application: In the firſt place, let it have the ſame <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> effect in every one of us, who find our ſelves inclinable to be conceited of our knowledge, and to deſpiſe our fellow brethren, who are not, as we apprehend, ſo far enlightned as our ſelves. Admit that we know more of God then many others do, that we can fathom deeper into thoſe holy myſteries, what reaſon have we to be proud? You hear that they who have the Name of God ſavingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shall that we have received, lift us up? and ſhall not that in which we are defective, caſt us down? Have we not far greater cauſe to be abaſed in the contemplation of the one, then to be exalted in the contemplation of the other? Indeed if we
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:46169:295"/>
were abſolute in this reſpect, and if (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all myſteries, and all knowledge,</hi> there were ſome colour then, though yet no juſt occaſion to be proud. But now it is the greateſt folly in the world to ſtrout and brave it in a back half naked, and half covered with borrowed feathers.</p>
                  <p>Well then my Brethren, let us do as the Apoſtle did in this caſe: Let us forget the things that are behind, and look on to the things that are before us: Let us conſider with our ſelves how ſhort we fall, and how far we are to ſeek in main things concerning God, which we are bound to know: How ignorant we are, how ill we have improved our time and means; and if this do not take us down, how juſtly may we periſh in our pride?</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>2</label> And as this doctrine ſerves to humble and abaſe the proud, ſo to revive and cheer the humble. Alas ſaith the diſtreſſed Chriſtian, how ignorant am I of God, his nature and his will? How little do I underſtand of his name? Though I have been a long time in the School of Chriſt, and have had abundant means, how little have I learned? what ſmall progreſs have I made? how far ſhort do I fall of many others? Oh the blindneſs of my mind, the darkneſs of my underſtanding to this day! I am afraid that I am none of thoſe whom Chriſt teaches.</p>
                  <p>Why, thou haſt heard, that they that have the Name of God declared to them, have yet defects and imperfections in their knowledge: So that however thou art much to ſeek in many things, and thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly defective in thy knowledge, thou mayſt be ſavingly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned notwithſtanding: And to uphold thy heart in this particular, conſider</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> It a ſign the little knowledge which thou haſt is right and ſound, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it humbles thee, and makes thee ſenſible of thy defects. This is the nature of the ſaving knowledge of the name of God, it is an humbling and an abaſing knowledg. Indeed, my brethren, carnal knowledge puffeth up, it makes men ſwell and ſtrut, and ſwagger, and ſo accordingly to ſlight their meaner brethren. Like the high-minded Phariſees, <hi>This people which knoweth not the Law is accurſed;</hi> Alas they are a company of ſots to us, they know nothing. But ſaving knowledge makes man humble, more humble then he was before he had it. They that are endued with it, thought better of themſelves before Converſion, before they had one glimpſe of this enlightning, then now they do.</p>
                  <p>And hence you ſhall obſerve in Scripture, that they that have excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led moſt in knowledge, have had loweſt apprehenſions of themſelves. None have complained ſo much of their corruption, blindneſs, ignorance as they have done. <hi>Agur</hi> was an exceeding wiſe and knowing man, yet he profeſſeth that he had not the knowledge of a man in him. He doth not ſay that he had not the knowledge of a Saint in him, but he had not the knowledge of a man in him; he was a beaſt in regard of underſtanding. And holy <hi>David</hi> though eminent in this regard, yet was not puffed up, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.1. No, he bewayls his ignorance exceedingly, and ſaith he was in this reſpect <hi>as a beaſt before God,</hi> Pſal. 73.22. And moſt remarkable is
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:46169:295"/>
that of <hi>Job,</hi> Job 42.5, 6. <hi>Heretofore I heard of thee by the hearing of the ear;</hi> I have had in former times a dark remote confuſed knowledge of thee; I ſaw thee at a diſtance, as it were a great way off; but now I have a clearer and diſtincter knowledge of thee; and what was the event and iſſue of it? <hi>Now I abhor my ſelf in duſt and aſhes.</hi> So that if the degrees of knowledge which thou haſt (be they great or be they ſmall) do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee, and make thee little in thine own eyes, it is a comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that it is ſound.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever thy degrees of knowledge be, conſider they are ſuch as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Jeſus Chriſt in love and wiſdom hath allotted to thee. <hi>To every one</hi> (yea to him that hath the leaſt) <hi>is given grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 4.7. as he is pleaſed to diſtribute and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The body myſtical is ordered ſo, that every member hath a fit ſhare: To ſome he gives out greater meaſures and degrees of knowledge, the eminency of their ſtation calls for it; to thee perhaps he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated leſs, becauſe he ſees that leſs will be ſufficient for thee: <hi>From whom the whole body according to the effectual working in the meaſure of every part, maketh encreaſe,</hi> Epheſ. 4.16. Obſerve it well, my brethren, every member hath his meaſure. The leg, the arm, the little finger, are not all alike, but all according to their meaſure, and ſo there is a decent and due proportion.</p>
                  <p>The time is drawing on a pace, when theſe defects and imperfections <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in thy knowledge, under which thou groaneſt, ſhall be all ſupplyed; when the darkneſs of thy mind, the blindneſs of thy underſtanding ſhall be fully done away. <hi>That which is perfect is to come,</hi> though it be not yet come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10. when we ſhall clearly underſtand thoſe myſteries which Angels pryed into, but could not fathom; even when we ſhall be raviſhed from our ſelves, in ſweeteſt contemplations of the glorious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: when, as our Saviour tells us, we ſhall <hi>ſee God,</hi> and <hi>ſee him face to face,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks; <hi>Now we ſee him in a glaſs, but then face to face;</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>now we know God in part only, then we ſhall know as we are known;</hi> Now we ſee his back parts only, but then we ſhall behold (as far as finite creatures may be capable) the fulneſs of his glory.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that the glorious recompence which is to be diſpenſed in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> day of retribution, ſhall be proportioned not to our knowledge, but our practice and obedience. God will not have reſpect ſo much to what you know of him, as to what you do for him: <hi>He will give to every man</hi> (not according to his knowledge, but) <hi>according to his works: To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek glory and honor, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. (To them who do, and do well, and continue doing well, and patiently continue doing well, yea though they ſuffer evill for well doing) <hi>the Lord will render eternal life.</hi>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Jeſus Chriſt will be continually making further declarations of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Name to other Nations. He had declared it only to the people of the Jews, when he put up this ſupplication to his Father in my Text. Some Proſelytes of other Nations there might be among the Jews, who were partakers of his publique teaching: but certainly he had revealed his Father to no other Nation but the Jews only. For his Commiſſion was confined to them, as he profeſſed to the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> woman, Matth. 15.24. <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> I am to be my Fathers Meſſenger to them, and none but them immediately in my own perſon. If I go further, I exceed my bounds; For till the
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:46169:296"/>
reſurrection of our Saviour, the partition-wall between the Jews and Gentiles was not broken down: And ſo accordingly he preacht not peace, he did not manifeſt that ſweet part of his Fathers Name to thoſe that were afar off, neither by himſelf, nor by his Miniſters, till after that time, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſinuates, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16, 17. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he ſent forth his Apoſtles, Mat. 10.5. his expreſs injunction was, <hi>Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any City of the</hi> Samaritans <hi>enter ye not: but go ye rather to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael. Which courſe or method the Apoſtles in the firſt place very carefully obſerved, as you may ſee, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.15. It was neceſſary, ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to the Jews, that the Word of God the Goſpel (in which the Fathers name is manifeſted and made known to men) ſhould firſt of all be preached unto you.</p>
                  <p>But ſince that time he hath declared it by his Miniſters to other Nations. To whom his laſt Commiſſion was, <hi>Go into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark. 16.15. <hi>Go ye and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> Mat. 28.19. And in purſuance of this Commiſſion and command of his, even the Apoſtles while they lived, did ſpread it far and wide. The Scripture ſtory ſeems to hint it to us, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. <hi>ult.</hi> where after the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Mandate of our Saviour, it is immediately obſerved by the Evangeliſt, that they went forth and preached everywhere. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> reporteth, that himſelf alone had filled with the Goſpel all the Countrey from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even round about unto <hi>Illyricum;</hi> yea, that he ſtrived to preach it where Chriſt was not ſo much as named, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19, 20. You may ſuppoſe the reſt of the Apoſtles were not idle in their places: The ſtories of the Church give in ſome Teſtimonies to it; For <hi>Stapleton</hi> reports of <hi>Thomas</hi> that he preached to the <hi>Indians;</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> ſaith there is no Nation, either <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Barbarian,</hi> among whom prayers are not made in the Name of Jeſus: And ſo to whom God is not manifeſted as a Father in his Son Chriſt. But yet we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from this, an univerſal Declaration of the Name of God to every people, Iſland, Nation in the world, in the times of the Apoſtles. For ſince their dayes, Chriſt hath revealed it to many Countries, and to many people.</p>
                  <p>And yet at this day there are many Nations that have not heard of God in Chriſt; That Name of his hath not been declared to them: But to them he will declare it before the conſummation of the world; they ſhall all hear of it; <hi>The Goſpel</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>ſhall be preached to all the world, and then ſhall the end come,</hi> Mat. 24.14. So it behoveth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ſhould be preached in his Name, and that among all Nations, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24 47. There is a fulneſs of the Gentiles yet to be brought in, by this diſcovery of the Fathers Name: which Chriſt will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh in his own time; He hath begun of late to manifeſt it to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and he will certainly go on with that work, till all the People, Languages, and Nations in the world do ſerve the Lord: till <hi>the ends of all the world do turn to him, and all the Kindreds of the earth do worſhip before him: And till he be Governour in all Nations,</hi> Pſal. 22.27, 28. You ſee then Jeſus Chriſt will be continually making further Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:46169:297"/>
of his Fathers name to other Nations: ſtill it is, I have declared it, and I will declare it, with reference to other Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And ſo it is with reference to other perſons, in thoſe Nations where it is declared already. He hath declared it unto ſome, and will declare unto others ſtill, in every age to the end of the world. There will be ſome elect continually to be brought in by this means. Some to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Church, ſome to be joyned to the body myſtical, untill the diſpenſation of the fullneſs of time which the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.10. <hi>when all things ſhall be gathered into one, which are in heaven, and which are on earth.</hi> So that you ſee my brethren, Jeſus Chriſt will be continually making further declarations of his Fathers Name to other Nations and to other perſons. But how will he make theſe further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations? Brethren, he will not do it in his own perſon, or by his own immediate voyce: But he will do it other wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By his written word and Miniſters in all ages: for that which they declare in his name and by authority from him, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares. To this end Chriſt hath ſet ſome in the Church, ſome Miniſters of all ſorts, as the Apoſtle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. And that is out of all diſpute in the univerſal Church, which is not limited to any Countrey, or to any age. That ſo there might be continually ſome in all Churches and in all ages, to publiſh what is to be manifeſted of his Father. And hence ſaid Chriſt to his Apoſtles, Mat. 28.20. <hi>Lo, I am with you to the end of the world.</hi> They were not to continue for their own parts by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred years ſo long: And therefore it muſt alſo ſtretch to thoſe who were to follow them in the office, and the work of Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till it be publiſhed univerſally to all Nations, in the outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation, and in the inward and effectual revelation to all perſons to whom it is appointed ſo to be revealed: Which was not done, you know, by the Apoſtles: it was but begun by them, and muſt be carrried on, till it be finiſhed, by other Miniſters to the end of the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Saviour Chriſt aſcended, and conſequently could no longer teach his Church immediately in his own perſon, <hi>he gave gifts unto men,</hi> ſuch gifts as he never gave before: <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts:</hi> Some temporary, ſome perpetual, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry.</hi> How long? <hi>Till we all come</hi> (all that are choſen, whether Jews or Gentiles) <hi>in the unity of the Faith, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a perfect man.</hi> So that the Miniſtry ſhall be continued, till all be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into Chriſt, that ſhall be gathered, and that is till the end of the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt makes theſe further declarations of his Fathers name in every age; by his ſpirit. As he declares it outwardly to other perſons by his word, ſo he declares it inwardly to other perſons by his ſpirit, to his elect in every age to the end of the world. And therefore when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt withdrew his corporal and fleſhly preſence, he ſent his ſpirit down to teach his people, to lead them into all truth: And by that ſpirit he declares his Fathers name, and will do to the worlds end. And he aſſured his Apoſtles in the place even now alledged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. when he was even about to leave them, as to his fleſhly preſence with
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:46169:297"/>
them, <hi>Lo, I am with you alwayes, viz.</hi> by my ſpirit, <hi>to the end of the world.</hi> That is, with you and ſuch as you are, with you and your Succeſſors ſtill in every age, as long as the world endureth. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations,</hi> and my ſpirit <hi>ſhall be with you:</hi> So that what you teach all without, he ſhall teach my elect within, powerfully and with ſucceſs, till the laſt man be gathered in: And then ſhall the end come.</p>
                  <p>Is it ſo that Jeſus Chriſt will be continually making further declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Fathers name to other Nations and to other perſons to the end of the world?<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>
                     </label> Then let us ſeriouſly conſider what our dutie is in reference to this work, (which will be beautifull and glorious beyond all compariſon) and what Chriſt expects of us. If he will do as he hath ſaid, let us examine what we are to do, and what duty lyeth upon us, (relating to it) in the mean time. And here I ſhall propound a few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us give him ſo much credit as to believe what he hath ſpoken. And though it ſeem improbable that Chriſt ſhould manifeſt his Fathers name to all Nations: That all the Countreyes in the world ſhould come to know him, and to be acquainted with him: yet ſeeing Chriſt hath undertaken it, and bound himſelf by faithfull promiſe to his Father, that as he hath declared his name already, ſo he will be continually making further declarations of it to other perſons and to other Nations, let us ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to it. As <hi>Mary</hi> ſometimes, when ſhe had ſtaggerd at the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Promiſe, at length recovered out of that fit of unbelief, and ſet the ſeal of faith to it, <hi>Be it according to thy word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let our hearts be full of hope, in reference to this buſineſs. Since Chriſt hath undertaken it, let us expect the execution of it. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours words (my brethren) are a promiſe to the Father, what he will do in after times for his people: Saith he, <hi>I will declare thy name to them.</hi> And therefore as it is our duty to believe the promiſe, ſo to expect the good things promiſed. To be continually in a waiting frame, looking and harkning after the accompliſhment of this eximious work of his, ſpying if we can ſee the day break, and the Fathers name ſhine forth to other Nations, who never had a glimſp of it by any Goſpel Revelation, till in the end <hi>from the riſing of the Sun unto the going down of the ſame, his name be great among the Gentiles,</hi> according to that Propheſie relating to theſe latter times and ages of the world, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us ſtrive with Chriſt in prayer, that he would make good the word that he hath ſpoken to the Father before ſo many witneſſes. Oh my beloved, when ye look on many Heathen Nations that yet are overwhelmed in ignorance and Egyptian darkneſs, that yet know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Fathers name; when you look on many Chriſtians in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that yet are even in as bad a caſe as they, ſome of which it may be have relation to your ſelves: go to Jeſus Chriſt and ſay, O Lord, thou haſt profeſſed that thou wilt declare thy Fathers name to other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to other Nations, to the end of the world. Lord, there are ſuch Nations, there are ſuch perſons who yet are ſtrangers to the Father; who know no more of God in Chriſt, then the very beaſts that periſh: O be intreated to declare thy Fathers name to them. Lord, manifeſt
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:46169:298"/>
the Father to them, that they may know him to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let our hearts be full of joy while we are looking forward to the accompliſhment of this work. O let it chear our ſpirits, under all the ſinking damps and deep diſcouragements that are upon them, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Church, to think in what a bleſſed ſtate and glorious poſture ſhe will be, when Chriſt ſhall have declared his Fathers name to all the Nations under heaven, when the Jews ſhall be converted, and when the fulneſs of the Gentiles ſhall come in: Oh my beloved, that will be a joyfull time indeed. Its true, thoſe times, my brethren, ſhall be very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and full of gladneſs many wayes. And this is not the leaſt, that people ſhall be brougbt in to the knowledge of the Lord out of all the quarters of the world, and that by heaps and multitudes. And when they come, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> ſhall be brought with gladneſs and rejoycing, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaks, Pſal. 45.15. <hi>With gladneſs and rejoycing ſhall they be brought.</hi> And truly they that have the happineſs to live in thoſe dayes, cannot but be extreamly taken with it, when they behold the Fathers name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the people of the Jews, and to ſuch multitudes of Nations of the Gentiles, ſo that they ſhall come thronging in ſo faſt as if they were in haſte to be acquainted with him, and to know more of him: Oh they will be an end at this, and their hearts will leap within them. There was never ſuch a time ſince the foundation of the world, nor ſhall be till that bleſſed ſeaſon come: and therefore let our ſouls rejoyce in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of it, though we never live to ſee it.</p>
                  <p>And thus far of our Saviour faithfullneſs, in the delivery of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Errand, in the diſcovery of his Fathers name to his people. He hath been faithfull and will be faithfull in it. In the remainder of the verſe, he ſhews the end and reaſon of it, why he hath been ſo, and will be ſo, <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a very great queſtion, whether believers be intended here to be the objects, or the ſubjects of the love our Saviour mentions. Whether the name of God be manifeſted to them to this end, that they may be beloved by him, or to this end that they may love him. I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all Interpreters almoſt that I have ſeen, make them the objects, not the ſubjects of this love, <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them;</hi> That is, ſay they, may reach to them, or come to them: their meaning is ſo as to lay hold upon them, and embrace them. In plainer terms, that thou maiſt love them with the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, with the very ſame affection.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this Expoſition there are two Exceptions, to which I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I know not how to give a cleer Solution. For Firſt, If this were the intention of our Saviour, <hi>I have declared unto them thy name,</hi> that thou maiſt love them, he would have ſaid in probability, That thy love may be towards them, or That thy love may be upon them, rather then That thy love <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as here we have it) may be in them. This is a ſtrange expreſſion to ſay My love is in a man, when my intention is, I love him, or I have ſet my love upon him. But ſecondly, if when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Saviour ſaith <hi>that thy love may be in them,</hi> his meaning be, That thou
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:46169:298"/>
maiſt love them: how ſhall this be the end of his forementioned delaration of his Fathers name, as it is cleerly made in this place? <hi>I have declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them thy name,</hi> and will declare it, <hi>that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me, may be in them: That thou maiſt love them with the love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou haſt loved me.</hi> Doth Chriſt declare his Fathers name to men, his love, his mercy to this end that he may love them? Is this a proper means to that end? for God to be made known to men, that God may love them whom he is made known to? Brethren, God doth not love men becauſe his name is manifeſted and declared to them, but men love him upon that ground, and for that reaſon: the declaration of his name to them, is a means to make them love him.</p>
                  <p>And therefore I muſt needs crave leave to think the latter Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on probable, by which believers are made the ſubjects of the love here mentioned, <hi>I have declared unto them thy name,</hi> and will declare it, <hi>that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them</hi> as in the ſubjects of it: That the love which is originally in thy ſelf as in the fountain (as all other graces are) may be communicated and diſpenſed from thee to them, and become inherent in them.</p>
                  <p>You know my Brethren, we are ſaid to be partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. not by participation of the eſſence, but by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the properties of God, when the communicable properties of God, as holineſs and love and wiſdom, are diſpenſt to us. So here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour prayes his Father, that the love wherewith he hath loved Chriſt, may be given down from him into the hearts of his people, that they may have that very property in them alſo.</p>
                  <p>And to this end ſaith Chriſt, I have declared thy name, thy mercy, goodneſs, love to them, that this love may be wrought in them. That by this means their hearts may be enflamed, and filled with the love of thee: That they may have the love of thee in them, as the Apoſtle hath the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Phraſe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. <hi>How dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> So here, <hi>that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me,</hi> that very property <hi>may be in them,</hi> by way of derivation from thee, and that by the revealing of thy name to them.</p>
                  <p>If this be our Saviours meaning, as I can ſee no other for the preſent, the Obſervations will be two. Firſt, The love which is in true believers, comes from God. The love wherewith true believers love, is in a ſenſe the ſame wherewith God himſelf loves: Or the love wherewith God loves, is in a ſenſe in true believers. Secondly, The declaration of the Fathers name to them, is the great means that begetteth love in them.</p>

                     <hi>DOCTRINE.</hi> The love which is in true Believers comes from God.</head>
                  <p>The love wherewith he loveth, is in them, ſaith our Saviour in my text. <hi>viz.</hi> by way of diſpenſation from him. Love is originally, primitively and eſſentially in the Lord, and from him it is given down into the hearts of true believers. This is part of the divine nature, which they are made
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:46169:299"/>
partakers of, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. This is a print of his Image, whereby they are conformed to God, and made ſuitable to God, when they love as he doth; And conſequently, as he is, ſuch are they in this world. So that when an enlightned eye looks firſt on God, and ſees that he doth love, that he is love, and then looks on the believer, and ſees this grace of love communicated and diſpenſed from God to him, he finds that he is ſuch a one as God is: That he is like God in this world, though he ſhall be better like him in the world that is to come: This is a beam of his light (as other ſaving graces are) <hi>it comes down from the Father of lights,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17. And as the ſtars ſhine with a borrowed Luſter, even ſo do believers too. If there be this, or any other brightneſs in them, it is a beam of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a ſtreak and ray of the divine glory. They ſhine becauſe their light is come, <hi>viz.</hi> from God, <hi>and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon them,</hi> Iſa. 60.1. And in a word this is a ſtream of his fountain, which runs down from God to us: All our freſh ſprings are in him, as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.7. and conſequently all our ſtreams of living waters are from him. Firſt the ſprings of our ſtreams are in him, and then the ſtreams of his ſprings are in us. The love wherewith he loveth, is in us.</p>
                  <p>So that God doth not only teach us love, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ye are taught of God to love,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.9. but more then ſo, he gives us love. He doth not only teach it as a Maſter, but he beſtows it as a Donour and Diſpenſer; Yea, as a Donour of himſelf to us; for when he gives us love, he gives us down himſelf in ſome meaſure; And therefore by this love he is ſaid to dwell in us; Mark that Expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1. Epiſt. 4.10. <hi>God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> God is love properly, eſſentially (for whatſoever is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to God is God,) and he is the Original and Fountain of that love that is communicated to the Creature, and by this love he dwells in us. So that whoever hath this love in him, hath God in him; God in the beam, as we are wont to ſay; The room that hath the beam in it, hath the Sun in it; That place of the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> is full, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Love is of God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and every one that loves is born of God,</hi> while he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates in this of Gods nature, even as the Son is made partaker of the nature of the Father. The Point you ſee is fully proved, The love which is in true believers, comes from God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">

                     </label> And it muſt needs be ſo, becauſe it is not, neither can it be originally in, or of, or from our ſelves. The heart of man is naturally averſe, yea even abhorrent from the Love of God: And therefore in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, men are ſaid to hate God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. as in divers other places of the Scripture. Indeed it ſeems to be a little ſtrange that men ſhould naturally hate the chiefeſt good: And true it is, that nothing appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and preſented under the notion, reaſon, and the name of goodneſs can be hated and abhorred: But yet the chief good, looked upon as evil, either in it ſelf, or elſe to him that ſo conceives and apprehends it, may under ſuch a notion be ſo far from being loved as that indeed it may be hated. And thus it is with all unſanctified men. So that of our
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:46169:299"/>
ſelves you ſee it is impoſſible to have the love of God in us.</p>
                  <p>But whence muſt we have it then, if we be partakers of it? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle clearly ſhews us, Jam. 1.17. <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above.</hi> From above, what's that? why <hi>it cometh down from the Father of lights,</hi> that is, from God who is the fountain of it. And if every gift be from him, every good and perfect gift, then ſurely love which is in ſome reſpect the choiceſt of all other guifts (as the Apoſtle ſhewes at large) is from him too. The love which is in true believers, comes from God.</p>
                  <p>But yet this Caution let me interpoſe, before I come to application. You muſt not apprehend the love which is in true believers, to come imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, without the uſe of ſecond means, as ſome have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to infer from that place of the Apoſtle, 1 Theſſ. 4.9. <hi>As touching love you need not that I write to you; for you your ſelves are taught of God to love.</hi> As if his meaning were, I need not teach it you at all, I need not ſtrive to work it and beget it in you, by my preaching; for you are taught imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately of God himſelf. Whereas indeed he ſpeaks comparatively, not as though they had no need at all of his inſtruction, but not ſuch need as many other men who were not taught of God to love. As ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are very uſual in the Scripture, which in ſhew are univerſal, yet to be underſtood <hi>ex parte,</hi> and in compariſon, as that for inſtance, <hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; none in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, not ſimply none. But as for love, that it is mediately wrought by means, as by the preaching of the Goſpel, is very manifeſt by this, that the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>John</hi> eſpecially, do ſo frequently and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade and preſs to it: which they need not to have done, if God did work it in the hearts of his people immediately by the teaching of his ſpirit. Indeed my brethren, every ſaving grace flows clearly from the upper ſpring, but yet there are ſome pipes that carry and convey it down to us, as the Word and Ordinances and the like. And he that lives above them, lives above grace too. And therefore in my text, our Saviour makes his declaration of his Father name, by himſelf and his Apoſtles and their Succeſſors in the Church, the means of working love in the hearts of his people; <hi>I have declared unto them thy name and will declare it, that the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo my brethren, that the love which is in true believers comes <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> from God? Here then we are directed where to go, and to whom to have recourſe for this grace. <hi>If any man lack wiſdom,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let him ask it of God.</hi> And ſo ſay I in this caſe, If any man want love to God, or to his Brethren, let him ask it of God. Let him go to God the Fountain and the ſpring of it, and beſeech him earneſtly to give it down to poor creatures. If we find our hearts are cold and dull and flat, if they be not inflamed with the love of God, let us entreat him to kindle them at his fire. Let us begg him that the love which is in him may be in us. Let us pray with the Apoſtle, <hi>The Lord direct our hearts unto the love of God,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3.5. They cannot find the way themſelves; <hi>the way of peace,</hi> and ſo the way of love, <hi>they have not known.</hi> Now the good Lord himſelf direct
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:46169:300"/>
them, and guide them into that way. It cannot chooſe but be a pleaſing and a lovely ſuit indeed, to be importunate with God to make us love him and to endear our hearts to him. A man would think that ſuch a ſweet requeſt as this ſhould not be turned off with a denial. And that we may the rather ſtruggle in it, I ſhall propound two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Love as it comes from God, ſo it is in ſome reſpect the chiefeſt thing that comes from God. It is a grace of the firſt magnitude, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is placed firſt by the Apoſtle in that Catalogue of his, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit is love,</hi> and then joy, and other graces. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling gift: and therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to ſhew the matchleſs worth and the ſurpaſſing value of it, admits a kind of Solaeciſm in his diſcourſe, and makes it better then the beſt of gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ult. <hi>Covet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and covet earneſtly the beſt gifts.</hi> And then immediately annexeth a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of love, and touching that he ſaith, <hi>I ſhew unto you a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed it is of greater latitude then other graces, it runs through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precept of the Law of God. For love is the fulfilling of the Law, and that no other grace is. It is of greater power then other graces, for it ſets them all on work. And hence the acts of other graces are frequently aſcribed to love, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, <hi>&amp;c ſhe hopeth, ſhe belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> &amp;c. It is of greater permanency then other graces, then faith, or hope. And other graces without love are nothing, as the Apoſtle ſhews at large in that Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And as love is the chiefeſt thing that comes from God, ſo it is the chiefeſt thing that conformeth us to God. It makes us like him more then other graces do. God is not ſaid in Scripture to be faith, or hope, or patience, but he is ſaid in Scripture to be Love. If we believe, God doth not ſo: if we hope, God doth not ſo: if we ſuffer quietly, God doth not ſo: Indeed he ſuffer not at all, either by way of paſſion or compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But if we love, my brethren, ſo doth God. In this we do as God himſelf doth. And therefore we may pray for this, (my brethren) in another way then we may pray for other graces, according to the pattern in my Text. We cannot pray to God, Lord grant us that the faith which is in thee, may be in us: Lord grant us that the hope which is in thee may be in us; But we may pray, Lord grant us that the love which is in thee, may be in us; That the love wherewith thou loveſt, may be given down to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Is it ſo that the love which is in true believers, comes from God? If then we have the love of God in us, let us remember whence it came, and to whom the glory of it ought to be returned. We can hate God of our ſelves, but we can never love him of our ſelves. So that if there be any ſpark of the love of God in us, we may be confident that it was kindled at his fire. And therefore let it be continually working upward, upward ſtill, yea, let it never leave aſcending till it have joyned it ſelf unto that infinite and endleſs flame, from which it iſſued and proceeded.</p>

                  <p>IT is to this end that our Saviour makes it known, as you may ſee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly in my Text; <hi>I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it;</hi> Why ſo? to what end? <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me</hi> (that very property) <hi>may be in them;</hi> That as it is in thee, it may be wrought in them alſo. And out of doubt the means our Saviour pitches on, are uſeful and available to his ends.</p>
                  <p>Indeed men come to know the Father, by the diſcovery of his name to them; for ſo his name is all that makes him known to men: And that which worketh knowledge of him, doth mediately work love to him: So that if the diſcovery of his name do make men know him (as that is very manifeſt) it doth make them love him too. That which one affirms of Learning, may be applyed to God, <hi>Non habet Inimicum niſi ignorantem.</hi> Whoſoever knows him clearly, loves him truly; Indeed while we are unacquainted with him, the admirable worth and beauty, and excellency that is in him every way, doth not take a whit upon us. The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher will tell us that the mind muſt be informed and convinced of the goodneſs of a thing, before the heart will cleave to it, or the affections cloſe with it: And hence it is, that carnal and unſanctified perſons love not God, becauſe they know him not: Or if they know him any way, it is not under ſuch a notion as renders him deſirable or lovely to them. Perhaps they know him as a Judge, or an avenger; they cannot know him as a Saviour and Redeemer. And this is the real cauſe why the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Saints in Heaven, love him more then the Saints Militant on earth, becauſe they have a fuller, clearer and diſtincter knowledge of him. We ſee him darkly in a glaſs, they face to face. And this is the reaſon alſo why we love not God with ſuch a high affection here as we ſhall do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, becauſe we know him not ſo well, we have not ſuch diſtinct and full diſcoveries of his name, as then we ſhall attain to. So then you ſee in general, that the diſcovery of the Fathers name to men is one eſpecial means to work the grace of love in them.</p>
                  <p>To clear it yet a little further to you. I ſhall ſhew you particularly and diſtinctly, that there are divers things in Gods name, which (being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted and declared unto men) are means to win their hearts to him, and ſo to work love in them. As</p>
                  <p>The beauty of the Lord is a part of his name, and beauty being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and diſcovered is a means to win love. It is a great attractive of affection. Now herein God excells (my brethren) in this reſpect, he is incomparably, out of meaſure lovely: The greateſt beauty in the world
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:46169:301"/>
is holineſs; ſo it is often called, as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2. To ſhew that holineſs hath beauty in it; yea it is called <hi>Beauties</hi> in the plural number; <hi>The beauties of holineſs;</hi> Pſal. 110.3. to intimate that holineſs is full of beauty, and that it over-matches all the beauties in the world, if all of them were put together: And therefore this is made in Scripture the greateſt beauty of the creature; as Sin is the deformity, ſo Grace and Holineſs is the beauty of the Soul, it adorns the inner man: And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth Chriſtian women to adorn <hi>the hidden man of the heart</hi> with this, 1 Pet. 3.4. <hi>Even with the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is of great price in the ſight of God:</hi> And hence it is that holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is likened to the faireſt things, to Robes, and Gems, and Crowns, and Gold, and Jewels, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now God is matchleſs in this kind of beauty; He is holineſs it ſelf; yea, he is infinitely holy: And therefore holineſs is called the <hi>Image of God.</hi> The holineſs that is in men, is but an image and a pattern of that holineſs which is originally and compleatly in the Lord: who hath in this reſpect all beauty in him. Yea, it is called <hi>the glory of the Lord,</hi> Rom. 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned and are deprived of the glory of God,</hi> which ſhined in us in the ſtate of innocency. Indeed, my brethren, he hath in him the Sum and the perfection of beauty; He hath all in him that doth win and raiſe, nothing that cools or deadens the affection; all things to invite, nothing to avert love. Others there are (my brethren) who have ſome things beautiful and comely to invite and draw love, but other things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely and unbeautiful to keep it off: Something or other there is in them that is odd, unpleaſing, and ſo a bar, and hindrance to affection. Brethren, it is not ſo with God, he is all beautiful, and all alluring, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether lovely: Others are ſo in ſome reſpects, but he is ſo in all reſpects, <hi>He is altogether lovely,</hi> the allurement of all hearts; <hi>And the deſire of all Nations,</hi> Hag. 2.7. So he is always in the merit, although he be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſo in the event.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But if God be ſo beautiful, what is the reaſon that men do not love him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe his name, in this reſpect, is not made known to them. All men are naturally blind, you know; and blind men cannot judge of beauty, until their eyes be anointed with the Eye-ſalve, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.18. to make them ſee ſuch beauty as this is: The beauty of holineſs is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual beauty, and that is not diſcerned by a natural Eye. There muſt be a ſpiritual eye to ſee and to diſcern a ſpiritual beauty: And when you have ſuch eyes as theſe, to ſee the beauty of the Lord, your hearts will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured on him; you will be in the caſe the Church was, you will be ſick of love, and ſay, Lord, turn away thine eyes, for they have overcome us: We cannot bear the dazling rayes of ſuch beauty as thine is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The goodneſs of the Lord is a part of his name; and goodneſs being manifeſted and diſcovered, is a means to draw love. Now herein God excels (my brethren) he is good beyond pattern, and beyond meaſure: He is eſſentially good, good without goodneſs, (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed he is goodneſs it ſelf. The creatures be good, but not good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Their nature is good, but goodneſs is not their nature. But now
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:46169:301"/>
the nature and ſubſtance of God, is goodneſs it ſelf, ſo that he is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially good; and then he is alſo cauſally good, as Pſal. 119.68. <hi>Thou art good, and doſt good;</hi> Thou art good in thy ſelf, and thou doſt good to the creature, ſo that <hi>the earth is full of thy goodneſs:</hi> He is eminently good; ſo that whatſoever goodneſs is to be found among the creatures, is eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tranſcendently in God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now goodneſs is the object of love, and conſequently the allective of affection. If we have cauſe to fear God for his goodneſs, as <hi>Hoſ. 3. ult.</hi> then ſurely we have much more cauſe to love him, eſpecially ſince he is not only good in himſelf, but good to us: If this part of his name be manifeſted and made known to us, we cannot chooſe but love him, and delight in him. That phraſe of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is notable, and may be very well applyed to our purpoſe, Rom. 5.7. <hi>For ſcarcely for a righteous man will one die, but for a good man one would even dare to die:</hi> Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs draws not love as goodneſs doth: One man will hardly love ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo much for his uprightneſs as to die for him; but for his goodneſs manifeſted to himſelf on all occaſions, continually doing good to him, he may come to love him ſo, as even to lay down his life for him: And even for this cauſe we ſhall love God, and love him out of all meaſure, ſo as even to die for him, if this part of his name be fully manifeſted and made known to us.</p>
                  <p>The mercy of the Lord is a part of his name, and this if it be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to us, will beget love in us. You know the Lord is ſaid in Scripture to be <hi>merciful,</hi> yea to be <hi>rich in mercy;</hi> and that not only becauſe the mercy that he hath is pretious, but becauſe there is abundance of this pretious mercy in him; For both of theſe concur to riches; there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is pretious, and there muſt be much of it: and ſo it is with God in this caſe; He hath a maſs of mercy in him, a bottomleſs and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs treaſure, ſuch as the wants of all the world are never able to draw dry: And as a rich man, though he ſpend exceedingly, yet becauſe he hath a treaſure, the e is no failing, no deficiency of his ſtore; ſo God though he communicate his mercy freely to the ſons of men, yet he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exhauſted; no, there is more behind ſtill, it is an infinite, a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs, an endleſs mercy; A mercy that endures for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now this rich mercy God lays out, as many other ways, ſo chiefly in the pardon of our ſins: and hence we read of <hi>mercies and forgiveneſses</hi> in God, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9. Mercies as the cauſe and fountain; Forgiveneſſes as the effect and ſtream: And both you ſee my brethren, in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to ſhew the over-flowing mercy of the Lord. Indeed my brethren, there is mercy in all pardons; but in the pardon and remiſſion of the ſins of Gods people there is admirable mercy. And hence the Prophet won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at it, not knowing what to think, or to ſay of it; <hi>Who is a God like thee, that pardoneth iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Mic. 7.18. The Prophet is tranſported, and carryed out beyond himſelf in admiration. And mark it well He doth not ſay, There is no man like thee, but there is no God like thee. Indeed it goes beyond the mercy of any but the true living God to do this. In which reſpect is that expreſſion, Hoſ. 11.9. <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſs of my wrath, for I am God, and not man:</hi> that ſpeech of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is full,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:46169:302"/>
Epheſ. 1.7. <hi>We have remiſsion of our ſins, according to the riches of his grace.</hi> Now if this part of Gods name be made known to us, it cannot chooſe but work love in us. We love them who forgive us common debts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be great, we think that we can never do enough for them, or manifeſt reſpect enough to them. But we have cauſe to love him more who forgives us ſuch debts as theſe are, which if they ſhould be rigorouſly exacted of us, we were not able to diſcharge them, but muſt be laid up under everlaſting chains. Oh my beloved, how can this chooſe but draw out our affection to the Lord? The woman in the Goſpel had much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her: and what was the effect and iſſue of it? Why <hi>ſhe loved much;</hi> Her love was anſwerable to her pardon: <hi>Much was forgiven her, and ſhe loved much:</hi> She was a great ſinner, and ſhe had a large pardon, and ſo accordingly ſhe ſhewed great love. O my Beloved, if ſuch mercy be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to us, we cannot chooſe but do as ſhe did; if we ſurvey our lives, and find perhaps that we have been grievous ſinners, beyond the ordinary rate, that we were over head and ears in debt to God, that there were horrid crimes upon the bill againſt us, ſcarlet ſins, and bloody ſins: and then the Fathers name is manifeſted to us, that he hath been to us <hi>The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gratious, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſin: And that according to the multitude of his tender mercies he hath blotted out our tranſgreſsions:</hi> how will our hearts come off to him? how will they flame with love to God? ſo that we ſhall cry out, O how do we love the Lord! we are not able to expreſs it, how infinitely dear is God to me!</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The Love of God is a part of his name: and this if it be manifeſt alſo, will beget love in us: When it ſhines forth from God upon our hearts, it will reflect, and ſo return to God again. This flame will kindle our fire, and make it burn, that all the waters in the world will never quench it, as Cant. 8.7. <hi>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the flouds drown it. Amor eſt cos amoris,</hi> love is the ſpecial thing that whets love, and that makes it keen and ſharp: So it is with the love of man, and ſo with the love of God. If it be made known to us, and if we have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, it will exceedingly indear our hearts to him; <hi>We love him,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt <hi>John,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 4.19. Why ſo? <hi>becauſe he loved us firſt;</hi> The declaration of his love to us, works love in us to him again. Firſt he loves us, and when we know it, then we love him. So that the point is fully proved, The Declaration of the Fathers name to men is one great means to work the grace of love in them.</p>

When you are ſingle and alone, ſtudy the name of God; think of his attributes: let them be often in your meditations, as you ſhall ſee they were in <hi>Davids,</hi> if you read the Book of Pſalms, and then you will cry out not much unlike as he, <hi>O my God, how do I love thee, while I medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the beauty of thy glorious Majeſty, and thy marvailous works!</hi>

Firſt where love is, there the ſpirit is, whoſe ſpecial dwelling in believers is not by his Eſſence, but his graces, and chiefly by the grace of love: And hence we read of the Spirit of love, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. becauſe the Spirit is the cauſe of love. And hence we alſo read of the love of the ſpirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. becauſe love is the fruit of the ſpirit: ſo the Apoſtle ſtileth it expreſly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. Yea it is the prime fruit, the chief fruit, upon which all the reſt follow, as the Apoſtle makes it there, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love,</hi> and then <hi>joy, peace, meekneſs,</hi> and ſo on.

                  <p>Now where the ſpirit is, there Chriſt is: For his inhabitation in the ſoul is by the Spirit, and ſo it is explained by all Expoſitors with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, where Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in, and be in us, as ſuch expreſſions are very frequent in the Scripture: He is with us by his Spirit, and in us by his Spirit; as we are the <hi>habitation of God,</hi> ſo we are the habitation of Chriſt, <hi>through the Spirit,</hi> as it is in Epheſ. 2. <hi>ult.</hi> And as the Spirit dwells in us by love, ſo Chriſt dwells in us by the Spirit; ſo that where love is, there the Spirit is; and where the Spirit is, there Chriſt is.

Where love is, there faith is: And therefore you ſhall find them often knit together, and made inſeparable in the Scripture, Faith and Love. I need not give you inſtances: <hi>Virtutes Chriſtianae ſunt connexae,</hi> as a Father ſpeaks. All ſaving graces are united and conjoyned; they are made up together in a chain, ſo that if but one link be wanting, all the reſt are uſeleſs. If all of them be not united, not one of them is in ſincerity. But Faith and Love have a more near relation one to the other, then the reſt have: Faith to Love hath the nature of a Cauſe; Love to Faith the nature of an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Faith worketh love, love proveth faith: Faith without Love is a dead Belief: Love without Faith is a frozen Charity: So that where love is, there faith is.</p>
                  <p>Now beloved, where faith is, there Chriſt is: Faith takes in Jeſus Chriſt into the ſoul, and makes him to inhabit there: And therefore he is ſaid expreſly to <hi>dwell in the heart by faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. <hi>And he received gifts for men,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 68.18. <hi>Yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord may dwell among them.</hi> And if he dwell among and in us by his gifts, then certainly by faith, which is principal of thoſe gifts: So that where love is, there faith is; and where faith is, there Chriſt is.

You are not ignorant, that Chriſt and God the Father are often ſaid to be in one another, as in that place which we have largely handled in the 21 verſe of this Chapter, <hi>That they may all be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee;</hi> As Chriſt is God, the Father and himſelf are one Eſſence: In that conſideration they are ſo in one another, that they are the very ſame: The ſame Eſſence, (for ſo the union is Identical) though not the ſame Perſon: As Chriſt is Man, the Son is in the Father, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Son, by the union of the Manhood to the Godhead in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our Saviour; for the Manhood being joyned to the Godhead in the perſon of the Son, it muſt be mediately joyned alſo to the Father, with whom the Son, as God, is one: So that in both conſiderations Chriſt is one with God the Father; and if they be one, they muſt be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; they cannot be in all reſpects aſunder who are one: So that where love is, God is; and where God is, Chriſt is; That is the third thing. By this time, I ſuppoſe, the point is clear, where love is, there Chriſt is: For 1. where love is, there the Spirit is. 2. Where love is, there faith is. 3. Where love is, there God is.</p>
                  <p>Now is it ſo, my brethren, That where love is, there Chriſt is? That <label type="milestone">

Nay, who indeed are Enemies to both: who hate God and hate his people, and that with a perfect hatred: as multitudes there are of ſuch my Brethren, and that not in Hell only among the Devils, and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned crew, but on earth among men, who taſte continually of the goodneſs of the Lord, yea in the very boſom of the Church it ſelf.

And ſurely there are many every where, and in every Congregation, who pretend much love to Chriſt, and yet do really and truly hate him. It is not every one that calls him <hi>Rabbi,</hi> Maſter, as falſe <hi>Judas</hi> did, that kiſſes him and bows before him, that hath indeed the love of Chriſt in him: No, men may make a flouriſh and a ſhew of love to Chriſt, and yet may be as hearty enemies to him, and to his members, as <hi>Judas, Pilate,</hi> and the Jews were. And truly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of ſuch there are among us, and every place ſwarms with them.</p>
                  <p>Now my Beloved, in what a ſad and lamentable caſe are theſe men?

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> that find upon undoubted evidences, that they have this love in them, may take incomparable comfort hence: For they may be hence aſſured, that they have Jeſus Chriſt in them. If love be in them, Chriſt is in
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:46169:304"/>
them, as is apparently ſuggeſted in my Text; <hi>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them, and I in them.</hi> If that be in them, I ſhall aſſuredly be in them too, and therefore I have manifeſted and declared thy name to them, that love and I may dwell in them. Ah, my Beloved, what an admirable thing is this, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould <hi>live in you,</hi> as the Apoſtles phraſe is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. that your hearts ſhould be his houſe, in which he dwells and walks, and dines and ſups, and lodges every night, ſo that he is at home in your hearts that while he is a meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the remainder of the world, that while they are ſo far from having Jeſus Chriſt in them, that they have the Devil in them: Chriſt is not in them, but the devil is in them: He keeps the houſe as Chriſt ſpeaks; <hi>While the ſtrong man keeps the houſe:</hi> He keeps houſe in the hearts of wicked men, the Devil himſelf is the houſe-keeper there: there he dwells, and there he works, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.2. he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in them, they are the Devils houſe, the Devils ſhop; they are the houſe where he dwells, and the ſhop where he works: I ſay while it is thus with other men, while others have the Devil in them, they have Jeſus Chriſt in them. <hi>The ſtrong man is bound, and diſpoſſeſſed of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation: The Prince of this world is caſt out, and Jeſus Chriſt the King of glory is come in.</hi> Ah, my Beloved, what a happineſs is this! I wiſh that I were able to expreſs it to you, to ſet it off as it deſerves. How would it raviſh and tranſport you, and make you to ſit down in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at your bleſſedneſs in this world!</p>
                  <p>That you may gueſs a little at it, review the things that have been hinted at before. If Chriſt be in you, faith is in you, yea, all ſaving grace is in you; You are bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings, in that you have him in you. You have a magazine, a treaſure of the graces of his holy Spirit: So that you are ineſtimably rich, and this riches <hi>is Chriſt in you,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. Not Chriſt without us, but Chriſt within us by his graces, is our riches. <hi>If Chriſt be in you,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt himſelf is in you, as a Spirit of Illumination, and a Spirit of Sanctification, and as a Spirit of Conſolation. If you be ignorant, you have one within you to enlighten you: If you be impure, if you have dregs of ſin and of corruption in you, you have one within you to ſanctifie you; if you be ſad and comfortleſs, you have one within you to comfort you; the fountain and the ſpring of Conſolation is within you: ſo that he is at hand in all caſes, you need not faint, or ſwound away, while they fetch a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for you. If Chriſt be in you, God is in you; your hearts are his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and the great God of heaven himſelf is the light and glory of them. O bleſſed hearts that have God to dwell in them! But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary yet;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Chriſt be in you, you have moſt intimate and near acquaintance and Communion with him. It is very much (my brethren) for Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be with you. It was a pretious promiſe that he made to his Apoſtles, <hi>Behold I am with you:</hi> But for Chriſt Jeſus to be in you, is much more. This importeth yet more cloſe and ſweet Communion: Indeed the cloſeſt and the ſweeteſt that can be. You cannot chooſe but know him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, if he be in you.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="563" facs="tcp:46169:304"/>2. If Chriſt be in you, you have free acceſs to him, you need not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail far to ſpeak with Chriſt, he is at hand continually, for he is in you: ſo that you may on all occaſions, make your addreſſes to him when you pleaſe. If you have any ſupplication to preſent, any complaint to make to him, do but open your own hearts, and you ſhall find Chriſt there.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If you have Chriſt Jeſus in you, you are partakers of a confluence of all accommodations, comforts, ſatisfactions and delights that the poor heart can reaſonably long for, or look after: For Jeſus Chriſt hath all in him, and brings all with him, where he comes. Indeed (my Brethren) he himſelf is all, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is all in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. In all in whom he is (my brethren) he is all: So that in having him, we have all. There is more in him alone, to make us really and fully happy, then in all the world without him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If Chriſt be in you, as you are happy, ſo you are ſecure, there is no fear of falling from your happineſs; if you fall, Jeſus Chriſt falls with you, for he is in you: And this is that which makes our happineſs in all reſpects accompliſht, that as it is compleat and full, ſo it is permanent, and indeficient too. The more excellent it is, if it were not firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the greater were the fear, the greater were the miſery of deprivation. <hi>Fuiſſe faelicem,</hi> to have been happy, is the greateſt unhappineſs. But this felicity, my brethren, is enduring; In whomſoever Chriſt is, he dwells there; he doth not ſojourn, but he dwells there, never to depart again. The heart of ſuch a man is his ſetled habitation, of which he ſaith, Here is my reſting place, here will I dwell for ever: So that if Chriſt be in you, you are ſafe; for he will never leave you, nor depart from you, and then it is impoſſible that you ſhould periſh. Ah, my Beloved, can a man be damned with Chriſt in him? caſt into hell with Chriſt in him? ſeparated from the Lord with Chriſt in him? Chriſt willl not, cannot leave him, that is once in Chriſt, ſo that if ſuch a man ſhould go to hell, Chriſt muſt go to hell in him.</p>
                  <p>And now to ſhut up all, ſince Chriſt is in you, Let me give you this caution, let him live quiet in your hearts; do not moleſt him, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb him there; Do not make him vex, and fret: let it not be a pennance to him to continue in you. Let him not ſuffer by your ſins, who ſuffer'd for them: But labour every way to pleaſe him, and to give him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and content: that ſo the houſe which he hath choſen meerly for your ſakes (for he hath heaven to dwell in) may not be dark and doleful, but delightful to him.</p>
                  <p>And thus at length we have diſpatched this heavenly Prayer of our Great High Prieſt and Interceſſor Jeſus Chriſt. He was even ready to go forth to ſuffer, when he made it. Me thinks I hear him ſaying to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, The time is now at hand that I muſt leave you, and be taken from the earth; Come let us pray before we part, and there; withall he lifted up his eyes to heaven, and poured out theſe holy brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of his Spirit, for himſelf and them. Oh what a bleſſed frame of heart! O what a choice and raiſed temper (think you) was he in at that time! O what a Prayer muſt that be that was made by ſuch a perſon, in ſuch a company, on ſuch an occaſion! Chriſt was in heaven in his
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:46169:305"/>
thoughts and his affections when he uttered it, and we have ſeemed ſometimes to be in heaven too, while we have handled it, and heard it. Well, it hath been a ſweet and precious ſubject, as ever we have dealt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I ſhall deſire you to review it often, and let not any choice impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that have been made upon you by it, out again. Let them not be like lines drawn upon the ſand; no ſooner formed but defaced: like water ſpilt upon the ground, that is not to be gathered up again. Here you have ſeen the heart of Jeſus Chriſt opened, and his affections plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully flowing out to his people. Our prayers ſhew our hearts to Chriſt; his prayer ſhews his heart to us. Here you have ſeen how our dear Friend, our Head, our Husband loved us, and had us in his mind and thoughts before he dyed. Us (I ſay) who now believe, as well as them that did believe in former times. How earneſt and importunate he is with God the Father, that we may be one here, and that we may be in one place hereafter! O let us ſearch into the heart of Jeſus Chriſt, laid open to us in this Abridgement of his Interceſſion for us: that we may know it, and the workings of it continually more and more; until at length this precious Prayer come to have its full effect, and we be taken up to be for ever with the Lord, that where he is, there may we be alſo. <hi>Amen.</hi>
